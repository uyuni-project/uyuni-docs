# Links to book navigation files. These nav files are used to build the left navigation sidebar in the form of asciidoctor lists.
# We also keep our PDF lists in these files. Which one is used depends on what backend is selected via our Makefile. If you select to build pdf
# the backend-pdf ifdef statement will take effect and include all necessary files and images.

# WARNING: IF YOU ADD A NEW TOPIC TO THE ANTORA NAV LISTS YOU MUST ADD IT TO THE PDF LIST AS WELL!
