= Troubleshooting Disk Space


Running out of disk space can have a severe impact on the {productname}
database and file structure which, in most cases, is not recoverable.

{productname} monitors free space in specific directories, and has
configurable alerts.  For more on space management, see
xref:administration:space-management.adoc[].

You can recover disk space by removing unused custom channels and redundant
database entries before you run out of space entirely.

For instructions on how to delete custom channels, see
xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].

.Procedure: Resolving redundant database entries
. Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck`` command to list any redundant
  database entries.
. Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck --remove`` command to delete them.
