= Troubleshooting Package Synchronization


{productname} does not automatically trust third party GPG keys.  If package
synchronization fails, it could be because of an untrusted GPG key.  You can
find out if this is the case by opening [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync`` and
looking for an error like this:

----
['/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync', '--channel', 'sle-12-sp1-ga-desktop-
nvidia-driver-x86_64', '--type', 'yum', '--non-interactive']
ChannelException: The GPG key for this repository is not part of the keyring.
Please run spacewalk-repo-sync in interactive mode to import it.
----

To resolve the problem, you need to import the GPG key to {productname}.
For more on importing GPG keys, see
xref:administration:repo-metadata.adoc[].
