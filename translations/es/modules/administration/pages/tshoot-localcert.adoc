= Troubleshooting Local Issuer Certificates


Some older bootstrap scripts create a link to the local certificate in the
wrong place.  This results in zypper returning an ``Unrecognized error``
about the local issuer certificate.  You can ensure that the link to the
local issuer certificate has been created correctly by checking the
[path]``/etc/ssl/certs/`` directory.  If you come across this problem, you
should consider updating your bootstrap scripts to ensure that zypper
operates as expected.
