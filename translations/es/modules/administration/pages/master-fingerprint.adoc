= Set up a Client to Master Validation Fingerprint

In highly secure network configurations you may wish to ensure your Salt
clients are connecting a specific master.  To set up validation from client
to master enter the master's fingerprint within the
[path]``/etc/salt/minion`` configuration file.

See the following procedure:

. On the master, at the command prompt, as root, use this command to find the
  ``master.pub`` fingerprint:
+

----
salt-key -F master
----
+

On your client, open the [path]``/etc/salt/minion`` configuration file.
Uncomment the following line and enter the master's fingerprint replacing
the example fingerprint:
+

----
master_finger: 'ba:30:65:2a:d6:9e:20:4f:d8:b2:f3:a7:d4:65:11:13'
----

. Restart the salt-minion service:
+

----
# systemctl restart salt-minion
----
