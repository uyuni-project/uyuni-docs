[[live-patching]]
= Live Patching with SUSE Manager


Performing a kernel update usually requires a system reboot.  Common
vulnerability and exposure (CVE) patches should be applied as soon as
possible, but if you cannot afford the downtime, you can use Live Patching
to inject these important updates and skip the need to reboot.

The procedure for setting up Live Patching is slightly different for
SLES{nbsp}12 and SLES{nbsp}15.  Both procedures are documented in this
section.
