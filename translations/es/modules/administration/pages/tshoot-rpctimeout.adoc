= Troubleshooting RPC Connection Timeouts


RPC connections can sometimes time out due to slow networks or a network
link going down.  This results in package downloads or batch jobs hanging or
taking longer than expected.  You can adjust the maximum time that an RPC
connection can take by editing the configuration file.  While this will not
resolve networking problems, it will cause a process to fail rather than
hang.


.Procedure: Resolving RPC connection timeouts

. On the {productname} Server, open the [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` file
  and set a maximum timeout value (in seconds):
+
----
server.timeout =`number`
----
. On the {productname} Proxy, open the [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` file
  and set a maximum timeout value (in seconds):
+
----
proxy.timeout =`number`
----
. On a {sles} client that uses zypper, open the
  [filename]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` file and set a maximum timeout value (in
  seconds):
+
----
## Valid values:  [0,3600]
## Default value: 180
download.transfer_timeout = 180
----
. On a {rhel} client that uses yum, open the [filename]``/etc/yum.conf`` file
  and set a maximum timeout value (in seconds):
+
----
timeout =`number`
----

[NOTE]
====
If you limit RPC timeouts to less than `180` seconds, you risk aborting
perfectly normal operations.
