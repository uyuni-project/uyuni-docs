= Troubleshooting the Saltboot Formula


Because of a problem in the computed partition size value, the saltboot
formula can sometimes fail when it is created on SLE{nbsp}11 SP3 clients,
with an error like this:

----
          ID: disk1_partitioned
    Function: saltboot.partitioned
        Name: disk1
      Result: false
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1767, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1705, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/states/saltboot.py", line 393, in disk_partitioned
    existing = __salt__['partition.list'](device, unit='MiB')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/parted.py", line 177, in list_
    'Problem encountered while parsing output from parted')
CommandExecutionError: Problem encountered while parsing output from parted
----

This problem can be resolved by manually configuring the size of the
partition containing the operating system.  When the size is set correctly,
formula creation will work as expected.


.Procedure: Manually Configuring the Partition Size in the Saltboot Formula

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and
  select the ``Hardware Type Group`` that contains the SLE{nbsp}11 SP3 client
  that is causing the error.  In the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab, navigate to
  the [guimenu]``Saltboot`` subtab.
. Locate the partition that contains the operating system, and in the
  [guimenu]``Partition Size`` field, type the appropriate size (in MiB).
. Click btn:[Save Formula], and apply the highstate to save your changes.
