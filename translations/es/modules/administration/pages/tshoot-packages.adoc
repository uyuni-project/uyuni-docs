= Troubleshooting Package Inconsistencies


When packages on a client are locked, {productname} Server may not be able
to correctly determine the set of applicable patches.  When this occurs,
package updates will be available in the {webui}, but will not appear on the
client, and attempts to update the client will fail.  Check package locks
and exclude lists to determine if packages are locked or excluded on the
client.

On the client, check package locks and exclude lists to determine if
packages are locked or excluded:

* On an Expanded Support Platform, check [path]``/etc/yum.conf`` and search
  for ``exclude=``.
* On {sle} and {opensuse}, use the [command]``zypper locks`` command.
