= Troubleshooting Corrupt Repositories


The information in the repository metadata files can become corrupt or out
of date.  This can create problems with updating clients.  You can fix this
by removing the files and regenerating it.  With an new repository data
file, updates should operate as expected.

.Procedure: Resolving Corrupt Repository Data
. Remove all files from
  [path]``/var/cache/rhn/repodata/<channel-label>-updates-x86_64``.  If you do
  not know the channel label, you can find it in the {productname} {webui}, by
  navigating to menu:Software[Channels > Channel Label].
. Regenerate the file from the command line:
