= Mirror Source Packages

If you build your own packages locally, or if you require the source code
for your packages for legal reasons, it is possible to mirror the source
packages on {productname} Server.

[NOTE]
====
Mirroring source packages can consume a significant amount of disk space.
====

.Procedure: Mirroring Source Packages
. Open the [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, and add this
  line:
+

----
server.sync_source_packages = 1
----
. Restart the Spacewalk service to pick up the changes:
+

----
spacewalk-service restart
----

Currently, this feature can only be enabled globally for all repositories.
It is not possible to select individual repositories for mirroring.

When this feature has been activated, the source packages will become
available in the {productname} {webui} after the next repository
synchronization.  They will be shown as sources for the binary package, and
can be downloaded directly from the {webui}.  Source packages cannot be
installed on clients using the {webui}.
