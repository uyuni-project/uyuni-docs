= Tuning Changelogs

Some packages have a long list of changelog entries.  This data is
downloaded by default, but it is not always useful information to keep.  In
order to limit the amount of changelog metadata which is downloaded and to
save disk space, you can put a limit on how many entries to keep on disk.

This configuration option is in the [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``
configuration file.  The parameter defaults to [systemitem]``0``, which
means unlimited.

----
java.max_changelog_entries = 0
----

If you set this parameter, it will come into effect only for new packages
when they are synchronized.

After changing this parameter, restart services with ``spacewalk-service
restart``.

You might like to delete and regenerate the cached data to remove older
data.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting and regenerating cached data can take a long time.  Depending on
the number of channels you have and the amount of data to be deleted, it can
potentially take several hours.  The task is run in the background by
Taskomatic, so you can continue to use {productname} while the operation
completes, however you should expect some performance loss.
====

You can delete and request a regeneration of cached data from the command
line:

----
spacewalk-sql -i
----
Then on the SQL database prompt, enter:
----
DELETE FROM rhnPackageRepodata;
INSERT INTO rhnRepoRegenQueue (id, CHANNEL_LABEL, REASON, FORCE)
(SELECT sequence_nextval('rhn_repo_regen_queue_id_seq'),
        C.label,
        'cached data regeneration',
        'Y'
        FROM rhnChannel C);
