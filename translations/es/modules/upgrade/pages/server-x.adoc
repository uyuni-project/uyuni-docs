= Server - X Upgrade


Migrating {productname} from one major version to the next major version
must be done using two systems.  The migration happens from the original
source system to a new target system.  In-place migration is not available.

While this means that you temporarily need two systems, it also means that
the source system remains fully functional.  This is useful to reduce
downtime, and can act as a fallback if the migration is not successful.

Given the complexity of this process, if you experience any problems during
the migration, you will need to start over from the beginning.  The
migration involves exporting the entire database from the source system and
restoring it on the target system.  Additionally, all of the channels and
packages need to be copied to the target system.  You should expect the
entire process to take several hours.

[WARNING]
====
Migrating to 4.x from an older version such as version 3.2 can be
difficult.  We strongly recommend that you contact SUSE Consulting to assist
with this process.
====



== Prepare to Migrate

The source system must be running {productname} 3.2 with all the latest
updates applied.  Before you start, ensure that the system is up to date and
all updates have been installed successfully.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important that PostgreSQL 10 is already running on your
{productname} 3.2 system.  For more information, see
xref:upgrade:db-migration-10.adoc[].
====

During migration, the database on the source system needs to get exported.
The database export is compressed, and temporarily stored on the target
system.  The compression is done using [command]``gzip`` using the default
compression options.  Maximum compression only yields about 10% of space
savings.  Before you begin, check the size of the database on the source
system with:

----
du -sch /var/lib/pgsql/data
----

Ensure you have at least 30% of the total database size available in
[path]``/var/spacewalk/tmp`` on the target system.

The [path]``/var/spacewalk/tmp`` directory will be created if it does not
exist.  If you want the export to be stored somewhere else, change the
[var]``$TMPDIR`` variable at the beginning of the migration script.



== Set Up the Target System


.Procedure: Setting Up the Target System
. As the target system, install {productname} Server 4.1 using the unified
  installer.  {productname} Server 4.1 is based on {sle} 15 SP2.  For more
  information about installing {productname}, see
  xref:installation:install-server-unified.adoc[].
. From the command prompt, run the {yast} {productname} setup tool:
+
----
yast2 susemanager_setup
----
. On the setup screen, check [guimenu]``Migrate a SUSE Manager compatible
  server``.
. In the [guimenu]``Hostname of source SUSE Manager Server`` field, enter the
  source system hostname and domain.
. Enter the database credentials of the source system.
. Enter the IP address of the target system, or accept the default value if it
  is correct.  If multiple IP addresses are available, ensure you specify the
  correct one.
. Follow the prompts to complete the migration.  {yast} will terminate after
  the process is complete.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful when you specify the database credentials.  Ensure you use the
same database parameters as the source system.  Even if you intend to change
it later on, the database credentials must match during migration.
====


[NOTE]
====
During the migration process, the target system will fake its hostname to
match the source system.  Do not change the hostname during the process.  Be
careful when you log in to your systems during migration, as they will both
show the same hostname.
====

To speed up the actual migration and thus reducing the server downtime, you
can copy the system data in advance.  For more information, see
<<migration.troubleshooting.systemdata>>.



== Migration

When your target system is ready, begin the migration with this command:

----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/mgr-setup -m
----

While the data migration is in progress, the {productname} services are shut
down.  This is to ensure that no data is written to the database during the
migration.

This command reads the data that was gathered during the setup procedure,
sets up {productname} on the new target system, and transfers all of the
data from the source system.

Several operations need to be performed on the source system using SSH, so
you will be prompted once for the root password of the source system.  A
temporary SSH key named ``migration-key`` is created and installed on the
source system, so you need to give the {rootuser} password only once.  The
temporary SSH key will be deleted after the migration is finished.

Depending on the size of the installation, the migration can take several
hours.  When the migration has finished successfully, a ``migration
complete`` message is shown, and you are prompted to shut down the source
system.

When you have received the ``migration complete`` message, you need to
reconfigure the network of the target system to use the same IP address and
host name as the original system.  You will also need to restart the target
system before it can be used.



[[migration.troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

A complete migration can consume a lot of time.  This is caused by the
amount of data that must be copied.  Here are some hints how you can
compensate it.



[[migration.troubleshooting.systemdata]]
=== Copy System Data to the Target System


These numbers from a test installation illustrate the approximate time it
takes to export and import a small 1.8{nbsp}GB database:
----
14:53:37   Dumping remote database to /var/spacewalk/tmp/susemanager.dmp.gz on target system. Please wait...
14:58:14   Database successfully dumped. Size is: 506M
14:58:29   Importing database dump. Please wait...
15:05:11   Database dump successfully imported.
----

In this example, exporting the database took around five minutes, and
importing the export onto the target system took an additional seven
minutes.  For big installations this can take up to several hours.

You also need to account for the time it takes to copy all the package data
to the target system.  Depending on your network infrastructure and
hardware, this can also take a significant amount of time.

You can copy the data at any time before the migration process.  Copying the
data before you migrate can significantly reduce the amount of downtime
required when you perform the migration.

At any time before the migration, you can copy data with this command:

----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/mgr-setup -r
----

This command performs a copy using [command]``rsync``, and does not require
system downtime.  When you perform the migration, some data will still need
to be copied, but it will be significantly reduced if you have recently
copied the data.  This can make a significant difference to the amount of
downtime required for a migration.




[[migration.troubleshooting.pkgdata]]
=== Integrate Externally Stored Package Data

.Procedure: Migrating Data on an External Storage Device

If you have package data on external storage you do not need to copy this
data to the new system.  For example, if you have an NFS mount at
[path]``/var/spacewalk/packages``.

Follow this procedure after migration is finished, and before you start your
target system for the first time.

. Open the script at [path]``/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/mgr-setup``.
. Locate the [command]``rsync`` command on or around line 442, delete or
  comment it out, and save the file.
. Ensure your external storage is mounted on the target system.
. If [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub`` exists on your external storage, ensure it
  is mounted.
. Start the upgraded target system for the first time, and ensure it can
  access your external storage device.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All files and directories that have not been copied by the migration tool
will need to be manually copied to the new system.
