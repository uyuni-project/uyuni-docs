[[db-migration]]
= Upgrade the Database

To successfully perform a major {productname} update, you might need to
upgrade the underlying database.

If you are using PostgreSQL 9, and you are upgrading to version 10, see
xref:upgrade:db-migration-10.adoc[].  If you are using PostgreSQL 10, and
you are upgrading to version 12, see xref:upgrade:db-migration-12.adoc[].


If you want to upgrade to the latest {productname} version, you must be
using PostgreSQL version 10 or 12.  If you are using an older version, such
as version 9.6, you must migrate PostgreSQL to version 10 before you begin
the {productname} migration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you run PostgreSQL{nbsp}9.4 on {productname} 3.2, see the product
documentation at
https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suma/3.2/susemanager-best-practices/html/book.suma.best.practices/bp.sp.migration.html#sp.migration.postgresql.
You cannot migrate directly from PostgreSQL{nbsp}9.4 to version 10.
