= AutoYaST

When you install a {sle} client, there are a number of questions you need to
answer.  To automate installation, you can create an {ay} file with all the
answers to those questions, so that no user intervention is required.

{ay} files can be kept on a server and read by individual clients during
installation.  The same {ay} file is used to install multiple clients.

{ay} can be used to schedule a registered system to be installed with a new
operating system and package profile, or you can use it to install a new
system that was not previously registered, or does not yet have an operating
system installed.

For more information about {ay}, see
https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/.




== Before you Begin

Some preparation is required for your infrastructure to handle {ay}
installations.  Before you create an {ay} profile, consider:

* A DHCP server is not required for {ay}, but it can make things easier.  If
  you are using static IP addresses, you should select static IP while
  developing your {ay} profile.
* Host the {ay} distribution trees via HTTP, provided by {productname}.
* If you are performing a bare metal {ay} installation, use these settings:
** Configure DHCP to assign the required networking parameters and the
   bootloader program location.
** In the bootloader configuration file, specify the kernel and appropriate
   kernel options to be used.



== Build a Bootable ISO

You will need to create a bootable ISO image to be used by the target system
for installation.  When the system is rebooted or switched on, it boots from
the image, loads the {ay} configuration from your {productname}, and
installs {sles} according to the {ay} profile.

To use the ISO image, boot the system and type `autoyast` at the prompt
(assuming you left the label for the {ay} boot as ``autoyast``).  Press
kbd:[Enter] to begin the {ay} installation.

This is managed by the KIWI image system.  For more information about KIWI,
see http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/.



== Integrate with PXE

Instead of using a bootable ISO image, you can use a PXE image instead.
This is less error-prone, allows {ay} installation from bare metal, and
integrates with existing PXE/DHCP environments.

To use this method, make sure your systems have network interface cards
(NICs) that support PXE.  You will need to install and configure a PXE
server, ensure DHCP is running, and place the installation repository on an
HTTP server that is reachable by the {productname} Server.

Upload the {ay} profile to the {productname} Server using the {productname}
{webui}.

When the {ay} profile has been created, use the URL from the
[guimenu]``Autoinstallation Overview`` page as the image location.
