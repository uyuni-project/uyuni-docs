= Power Management

You can power on, power off, and reboot clients using the {productname}
{webui}.

This feature uses the IPMI protocol and is managed using a Cobbler profile.
The client must be IPMI-enabled, and configured to use a power management
server.  To use any power management functionality, IPMI configuration
details must be added to {productname}.

Navigate to menu:Systems[Systems List], select the client you want to
manage, and navigate to the menu:Provisioning[Power Management] tab.
Complete the details for the power management server, and click the
appropriate button for the action to take, or click btn:[Save only] to save
the details without taking any action.

You can apply power management actions to multiple clients at the same time
by adding them to the system set manager.  For more information about using
the system set manager, see xref:client-configuration:using-ssm.adoc[].



== Power Management and Cobbler

The first time you use a power management feature, a Cobbler system record
is automatically created, if one does not yet exist for the client.  These
automatically created system records are not bootable from the network, and
include a reference to a dummy system image.  This is needed because Cobbler
does not currently support system records without profiles or images.

Cobbler power management uses fence-agent tools to support protocols other
than IPMI.  Only IPMI protocols are supported by {productname}.  You can
configure your client to use other protocols by adding the fence-agent names
as a comma-separated list to the [option]``java.power_management.types``
configuration parameter in the [path]``rhn.conf`` configuration files.
