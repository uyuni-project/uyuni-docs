= Contact Methods

There are a number of ways that the {productname} Server can communicate
with clients.  Which one you use depends on your network architecture.

The {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) runs on traditional client
systems and periodically connects with {productname} to check for new
updates and notifications.  It does not apply to Salt clients.

Push via SSH and Push via Salt SSH are used in environments where clients
cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.  In this environment,
clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.  No system
within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network,
including the {productname} Server.

OSAD is an alternative contact method between {productname} and its
clients.  OSAD allows registered client systems to execute scheduled actions
immediately.
