= Automate Client Installation


{ay} and Kickstart configuration files allow you to automate client system
installations.  This is useful if you need to install a large number of
clients.

For {sle} clients, use {ay}.  When you have created an {ay} file, you can
upload and manage it using the {productname} {webui}.

For {rhel} clients, use Kickstart.  Kickstart files are created, modified,
and managed within the {productname} {webui}.

We recommend that you use PXE boot for installing clients.  PXE booting
requires a DHCP server that points to your {productname} Server.  The
{productname} Server then acts as a TFTP server.

The TFTP environment is generated with Cobbler.  Cobbler can also generate a
bootable ISO image.  The ISO image can be used to install machines when PXE
boot is not an option; for more information, see
xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].
