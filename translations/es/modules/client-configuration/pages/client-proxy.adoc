= Client Registration on a Proxy



Proxy servers can act as a broker and package cache for both Salt and
traditional clients.  Registering clients on a {productname} Proxy is
similar to registering them directly on {productname}, with a few key
differences.

These sections contain information on registering Salt clients on a proxy
using the {webui}, commands on the command line, or a bootstrap script.
There is also information on registering traditional clients using a
bootstrap script.


Within the {webui}, proxy pages will show information about both Salt and
traditional clients.  You can see a list of clients that are connected to a
proxy by clicking the name of the proxy in menu:Systems[System List >
Proxy], then select the [guimenu]``Proxy`` subtab of the
[guimenu]``Details`` tab.

A list of chained proxies for a Salt client can be seen by clicking the name
of the client in menu:Systems[All], then select the [guimenu]``Connection``
subtab of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab.

If you decide to move any of your clients between proxies or the server you
will need to repeat the registration process from the beginning.
