= Using the System Set Manager

System Set Manager (SSM) is used to administrate groups of systems, rather
than performing actions on one system at a time.  It works for both Salt and
traditional clients.

For a complete list of the tasks that you can perform with the SSM, see
xref:reference:systems/ssm-menu.adoc[].



== Setting up System Set Manager

You need to select which systems or system group you want to work with
before you can use SSM to perform operations.

You can access SSM in three different ways:

* Navigate to menu:Systems[System List], select systems you want to work with,
  and navigate to menu:Systems[System Set Manager].
* Navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups], and click btn:[Use in SSM] for the
  system group you want to work with.
* Navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups], select the group you want to work
  with, and click btn:[Work with Group].



== Using System Set Manager

The details you see in SSM might differ slightly from the details available
in other parts of the {productname} {webui}.  If you are looking at the
details of a single system in the {webui}, then you will only be able to see
the latest available versions of package updates.  When you look at package
updates in SSM, all available versions will be shown.  This is intended to
make it easier for system administrators to manage package versions, and
choose to upgrade to packages that might not be the latest version.
