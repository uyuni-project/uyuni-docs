.Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, use the [command]``tail`` command to check the synchronization log file:
+
----
tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log
----
+
. Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.
