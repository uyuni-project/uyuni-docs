== Rate Limiting Terminals

Salt is able to run commands in parallel on a large number of terminals.
This can potentially create heavy load on your infrastructure.  You can use
rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment.

For more information about rate limiting on terminals, see
xref:salt:salt-rate-limiting.adoc[].



===  Troubleshooting

Sometimes when attempting to reboot a terminal after attempting to apply the
Saltboot formula, the terminal will hang at the boot screen.  This can be
caused by a presence ping timeout value being set at a value that is too
low.  You can adjust the presence ping timeout value to fix this problem.
