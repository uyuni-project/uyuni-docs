= Using the Hub API


The Hub XMLRPCÂ API is a service that you can run on any machine using the
systemd unit file ``hub-xmlrpc-api.service``.  You can launch the API from
the command prompt:

----
systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api
----

When it is running, connect to the service using port 8888 using any
XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

For examples, see xref:large-deployments:hub-auth.adoc[].

Logs are saved in ``/var/logs/hub/hub-xmlrpc-api.log``.  Logs are rotated
weekly, or when the log file size reaches the specified limit.  By default,
the log file size limit is 10{nbsp}MB.
