= Virtual Host Managers

Virtual Host Managers (VHMs) are used to gather information from a range of
client types.

VHMs can be used to collect private or public cloud instances and organize
them into virtualization groups.  With your virtualized clients organized
this way, Taskomatic collects data on the clients for display in the
{productname} {webui}.  VHMs also allow you to use subscription matching on
your virtualized clients.

You can create a VHM on your {productname} Server, and use it to inventory
available public cloud instances.  You can also use a VHM to manage clusters
created with {k8s} and {caasp}.

After your VHM has been created and configured, Taskomatic will run data
collection automatically.  You can also begin data collection manually
through the {webui}, by navigating to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers],
selecting the appropriate VHM, and clicking btn:[Refresh Data].

For more information on VHMs, see xref:client-configuration:vhm.adoc[].
