You can visualize your virtualized, proxy, and systems group topologies.
Listed under menu:Systems[Visualization] you will find the
[guimenu]``Virtualization Hierarchy``, [guimenu]``Proxy Hierarchy``, and
[guimenu]``Systems Grouping`` subpages.  This features allows you to search,
filter, and partition systems by name, base channel, check-in date, group,
etc.

filters panel.  On the [guimenu]``Filtering`` tab, systems are filterable by
