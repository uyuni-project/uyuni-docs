= File Preservation

Collects lists of files to be protected and re-deployed on systems during
{kickstart}.  For instance, if you have many custom configuration files
located on a system to be kickstarted, enter them here as a list and
associate that list with the Kickstart profile to be used.

To use this feature, click the [guimenu]``Create File Preservation List``
link at the top.  Enter a suitable label and all files and directories to be
preserved.  Enter absolute paths to all files and directories.  Then click
btn:[Create List].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although file preservation is useful, it does have limitations.  Each list
is limited to a total size of 1Â MB.  Special devices like
[path]``/dev/hda1`` and [path]``/dev/sda1`` are not supported.  Only file
and directory names may be entered.  No regular expression wildcards can be
used.
====

When finished, you may include the file preservation list in the Kickstart
profile to be used on systems containing those files.
