[[sd-virtualization]]
= SD Virtualization

This tab allows you to create new virtual guests, apply images on a
traditionally managed host system, or change the status of virtual guests.
You can also list and manage the storage pools that are used for the virtual
machines.


image::system_details_traditional_virtualization_details.png[scaledwidth=80%]

The [guimenu]``Virtualization`` tab has one subtab, [guimenu]``Guests``.
For traditional systems that have Virtualization entitlements, you will also
see two additional subtabs for [guimenu]``Provisioning``, and
[guimenu]``Deployment``.  For Salt clients, you will also see
[guimenu]``Storage`` and ``Networks`` subtabs.  These tabs appear only for
systems having the Virtualization entitlement.  It is not possible to create
a guest system that runs on another guest system.

[[sdc-guests]]
== Guests

[guimenu]``Guests`` is the default virtualization tab.  It presents a table
of the host system's virtual guests.  For each guest system, the following
information is provided:

[guimenu]``Status``::
This field indicates whether the virtual system is running, paused, stopped,
or has crashed.

[guimenu]``Updates``::
This field indicates whether patches (errata) applicable to the guest have
yet to be applied.

[guimenu]``Base Software Channel``::
This field indicates the Base Channel to which the guest is subscribed.


[NOTE]
====
If a guest system has not registered with {productname}, this information
appears as plain text in the table.
====

[guimenu]``Actions``::
This field contains the possible actions for the guest.  These are depending
on the virtual guest status, they may not refresh instantaneously when
running a Start, Stop, Suspend, Resume action.  The btn:[Edit] button allows
changing virtual guest properties, including the amount of allocated memory
and virtual CPUs.

The btn:[Graphical Console] button opens the Spice or VNC display in a new
tab.

If you have System Group Administrator responsibilities assigned for your
guest systems, a user might see the message [guimenu]``You do not have
permission to access this system`` in the table.  This is because it is
possible to assign virtual guests on a single host to multiple System Group
Administrators.  Only users that have System Group Administrator privileges
on the host system may create new virtual guests.

For Salt systems, the btn:[Create Guest] button shows a dialog to configure
and create a new virtual machine.

[[sd-editing-a-vm]]
=== Editing a Virtual Machine

[NOTE]
====
Traditional systems can only edit CPU and memory allocation.
====

The fields in this dialog are grouped into several panels.  The
[guimenu]``General`` panel contains the [guimenu]``CPU`` and
[guimenu]``memory`` fields.  The [guimenu]``Disks`` and [guimenu]``Network
Interfaces`` panels list the fields corresponding to the matching devices of
the virtal machine.  The [guimenu]``Graphics`` panel allows configuring the
display of the virtual machine.  The [guimenu]``Schedule`` panel helps
configuring when the edit should take place by choosing either an earliest
time or an action chain to append to.

[NOTE]
====
If a guest contains one or more disks or network interfaces not recognized
by {susemgr}, you will not be able to edit the configuration.  This prevents
any possibility of {susemgr} destroying the setup because of an unhandled
type.
====

The order of the disks is important: the disk naming will be computed from
it. This means that the first virtio disk will be named 'vda', the second
will be named 'vdb' and so on.

When clicking the btn:[+] in the [guimenu]``Disks`` (or [guimenu]``Network
Interfaces``) panel header, a new disk (or network interface) will be
appended to the list.  Likewise, clicking the btn:[-] button next to a disk
or interface will remove it.  The default size for a new disk is 8[nbsp]GB.
The [guimenu]``Source image template URL`` field contains the URL to a disk
image to be copied and used for the virtual machine.

Click the btn:[Update] button to apply the changes.


[float]
[[sd-createing-a-vm-salt]]
=== Creating a virtual machine [Salt]

To create a new virtual machine, the process is similar to editing, but
there are some additional fields:

The [guimenu]``Name`` field defining the name of the virtual machine to
create.  The [guimenu]``Hypervisor`` field to allow choosing among the
available hypervisors of the host.  The [guimenu]``Virtual Machine Type`` to
choose between fully virtualized and para-virtualized virtual machines if
applicable.  The [guimenu]``Architecture`` to select the emulated CPU
architecture, the default being the virtual host one.

By default a disk and a network interfaces are added. The only required
value to set is the disk [guimenu]``Source template image URL`` or the
virtual machine will only have an empty disk.

The new virtual machine will start immediately after it has been defined.



[float]
[[sdc-virt-host-guest-graphical-console]]
===== Display a virtual machine graphical console [Salt]

The virtual machine graphical console might prompt you for a password.  This
password is the Spice or VNC one.


For the Spice display to be adjusted to the window, the Spice VD agent needs
to be installed within the virtual machine.


[[sd-virtualization-deployment-management]]
== Deployment [Management]

In the menu:System Details[Virtualization] tab of a traditionally registered
bare-metal machine, there is a menu:System Details[Virtualization >
Deployment] subtab. This form expects a URL to a ``qcow2`` type of image and
some other parameters allowing the user to schedule the deployment of that
image.

image::system_details_traditional_virtualization_deployment.png[scaledwidth=80%]

When the deploment scheduled it is listed as an action on the menu:Main
Menu[Schedule > Pending Actions].

== Storage for Salt Clients

The [guimenu]``Storage`` tab shows a tree list of the virtual storage pools
and volumes that are defined on the virtual host.  The first level of the
tree is the list of storage pools and all items contained in them are
volumes.  Expand the pools to show the volumes.


Each pool shows:

[guimenu]``Status``::
The pool is either running or stopped.

[guimenu]``Autostart``::
The pool starts automatically when the virtual host boots.

[guimenu]``Persistent``::
The pool will be kept after being stopped.

[guimenu]``Location``::
The target path of the storage pool.  Note that some pool types don't have
an associated path.

[guimenu]``Usage``::
The disk usage of the pool.  Shows ``Unknown`` if the pool is not running.

Each volume shows:

* The name of the virtual machines using the volume.  Some pool types will not
  provide this list.

* The disk usage of the volume.



=== Refreshing a pool

The [systemitem]``libvirt`` service does not automatically update the pool
usage and contents statistics.  Refresh the pool to see updated usage
statistics, or to see a volume that has been created outside of
{productname}.  Click the [guimenu]``Refresh`` button to schedule a refresh
of the pool.

.Procedure: Creating a Pool

. Click btn:[Create Pool]
. This opens a new page with a form to define the pool.
. In the [guimenu]``name`` field, type a name for the new pool.
. In the [guimenu]``type`` field, select the type of the pool.  The list of
  available types depends on the virtual host setup.
. Check the [guimenu]``Start during virtual host boot`` field, to start the
  pool automatically when the virtual host boots.
. OPTIONAL: In the [guimenu]``Earliest`` field, you can set the earliest time
  the pool creation action should be scheduled.
. OPTIONAL: In the [guimenu]``Add to`` field, you can select a new or existing
  action chain to add the pool creation action to.
. The [guimenu]``Source`` section contains data about the device holding the
  pool.
. The [guimenu]``Target`` section contains data about where to find the pool
  on the virtual host.
