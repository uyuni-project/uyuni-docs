= SD Provisioning

[sd-provisioning-overview]]
== Provisioning Overview

The [guimenu]``Provisioning`` tab and its subtabs allow you to schedule and
monitor AutoYaST or Kickstart installations and to restore a system to its
previous state.

[NOTE]
.Available for Clients Using the "`Traditional`" Method
====
The note [guimenu]``Provisioning`` tab will be available when adding a
client using the "`traditional`" method (system type ``management``). Using
Salt the [guimenu]``Provisioning`` tab will not be available (system type
``salt``).
====

{ay} is a {sle} and Kickstart is a Red Hat utility{mdash}both allow you to
automate the reinstallation of a system.  Snapshot rollbacks provide the
ability to revert certain changes on the system.  You can roll back a set of
RPM packages, but rolling back across multiple update levels is not
supported.  Both features are described in the sections that follow.



[[sd-provisioning-autoinstallation]]
== Autoinstallation

The [guimenu]``Schedule`` subtab allows you to configure and schedule an
autoinstallation for this system.  For background information about
autoinstallation, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-overview.adoc[].


image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_schedule_wizard.png[scaledwidth=80%]

In the [guimenu]``Schedule`` subtab, schedule the selected system for
autoinstallation.  Choose from the list of available profiles.

[NOTE]
====
You must create a profile before it appears on this subtab.  For more
information about profiles, see
xref:reference:systems/autoinst-profiles.adoc[].
====

To alter autoinstallation settings, click the btn:[Advanced Configuration]
button.  Configure the network connection and post-installation networking
information.  You can aggregate multiple network interfaces into a single
logical "bonded" interface.  In [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` specify kernel
options to be used during autoinstallation. [guimenu]``Post Kernel Options``
are used after the installation is complete and the system is booting for
the first time.  Configure package profile synchronization.

Select a time for the autoinstallation to begin and click btn:[Schedule
Autoinstall and Finish] for all changes to take effect and to schedule the
autoinstallation.

Alternatively, click [guimenu]``Create PXE Installation Configuration`` to
create a Cobbler system record.  The selected autoinstallation profile will
be used to automatically install the configured distribution next time that
particular system boots from PXE.  In this case {productname} and its
network must be properly configured to allow boot using PXE.

[NOTE]
====
Any settings changed on the [guimenu]``Advanced Configuration`` page will be
ignored when creating a PXE installation configuration for Cobbler.
====


The [guimenu]``Variables`` subtab can be used to create Kickstart variables,
which substitute values in Kickstart files.  To define a variable, create a
name-value pair ([replaceable]``name/value``) in the text box.

For example, to {kickstart} a system that joins the network of a specific
organization (for example the Engineering department) you can create a
profile variable to set the IP address and the gateway server address to a
variable that any system using that profile will use.  Add the following
line to the [guimenu]``Variables`` text box:

----
IPADDR=192.168.0.28
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
----

To use the system variable, use the name of the variable in the profile
instead of the value.  For example, the [option]``network`` portion of a
{kickstart} file could look like the following:

----
network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$IPADDR \
  --gateway=$GATEWAY
----

The [option]``$IPADDR`` will be ``192.168.0.28``, and the
[option]``$GATEWAY`` will be ``192.168.0.1``.

[NOTE]
====
There is a hierarchy when creating and using variables in {kickstart}
files.  System {kickstart} variables take precedence over profile variables,
which in turn take precedence over distribution variables.  Understanding
this hierarchy can alleviate confusion when using variables in {kickstart}.
====

Using variables are one part of the larger Cobbler infrastructure for
creating templates that can be shared between multiple profiles and
systems.  For more information about Cobbler and {kickstart} templates, see
xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].



[[sd-power-management]]
== Power Management

{productname} allows you to power on, off, and reboot systems via the IPMI
protocol if the systems are IPMI-enabled.

image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_power_management.png[scaledwidth=80%]

You need a fully patched {productname} installation.  To use any power
management functionality, IPMI configuration details must be added to
{productname}.  First select the target system on the systems list, then
select menu:Provisioning[Power Management].  On the displayed configuration
page, edit all required fields (marked with a red asterisk) and click
btn:[Save only].

Systems can be powered on, off, or rebooted from the configuration page via
corresponding buttons.  Note that any configuration change is also saved in
the process.  The btn:[Get Status] button can be used to query for the
system's power state.  If configuration details are correct, a row is
displayed with the current power status ("on" or "off").  If a power
management operation succeeds on a system, it will also be noted in its
menu:System Details[Events > History] subtab.

Power management functionalities can also be used from the system set
manager to operate on multiple systems at the same time.  Specifically, you
can change power management configuration parameters or apply operations
(power on, off, reboot) to multiple systems at once:

. Add the respective systems to the system set manager.  For more information,
  see xref:reference:systems/ssm-overview.adoc[].
. Select systems on the menu:Main Menu[Systems > Overview], then menu:Main
  Menu[System Set Manager > Provisioning > Power Management Configuration] to
  change one or more configuration parameters for all systems in the set. Note
  that any field left blank will not alter the configuration parameter in
  selected systems.
. When all configuration parameters are set correctly, click menu:Main
  Menu[Systems > System Set Manager > Provisioning > Power Management
  Operations] to power on, off or reboot systems from the set.

To check that a power operation was executed correctly, click menu:Main
Menu[Systems > System Set Manager > Status], then click the proper line in
the list.  This will display a new list with systems to which the operation
was applied.  If errors prevent correct execution, a brief message with an
explanation will be displayed in the [guimenu]``Note`` column.

This feature uses Cobbler power management, thus a Cobbler system record is
automatically created at first use if it does not exist already.  In that
case, the automatically created system record will not be bootable from the
network and will reference a dummy image.  This is needed because Cobbler
does not currently support system records without profiles or images.  The
current implementation of Cobbler power management uses the fence-agent
tools to support multiple protocols besides IPMI.  Those are not supported
by {productname} but can be used by adding the fence agent names as a
comma-separated list to the [option]``java.power_management.types``
configuration parameter.



[[sd-snapshots-overview]]
== Snapshots Overview

Snapshots enable you to roll back the system's package profile,
configuration files, and {productname} settings.


image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_snapshot_index.png[scaledwidth=80%]


Snapshots are always captured automatically after an action takes place.
The [guimenu]``Snapshots`` subtab lists all snapshots for the system,
including the reason the snapshot was taken, the time it was taken, and the
number of tags applied to each snapshot.

.Technical Details
[NOTE]
====
* A snapshot is always taken _after_ a successful operation and not before, as
  you might expect. One consequence of taking snapshots after the action is
  that, to undo action number X, then you must roll back to the snapshot
  number X-1.
* It is possible to disable snapshotting globally (in [path]``rhn.conf`` set
  ``enable_snapshots = 0``), but it is enabled by default. No further fine
  tuning is possible.

====


To revert to a previous configuration, click the [guimenu]``Reason`` for the
snapshot and review the potential changes on the provided subtabs, starting
with [guimenu]``Rollback``.

.Unsupported Rollback Scenarios
[IMPORTANT]
====
Snapshot roll backs support the ability to revert _certain_ changes to the
system, but not in every scenario.  For example, you can roll back a set of
RPM packages, but rolling back across multiple update levels is not
supported.

Rolling back an SP migration is also not supported.
====


Each subtab provides the specific changes that will be made to the system
during the rollback:

* group memberships,
* channel subscriptions,
* installed packages,
* configuration channel subscriptions,
* configuration files,
* snapshot tags.


When satisfied with the reversion, return to the [guimenu]``Rollback``
subtab and click the btn:[Rollback to Snapshot] button.  To see the list
again, click btn:[Return to snapshot list].


[NOTE]
.Background Information About Snapshots
====
There is no maximum number of snapshots that {productname} will keep, thus
related database tables will grow with system count, package count, channel
count, and the number of configuration changes over time.  Installations
with more than a thousand systems should consider setting up a recurring
cleanup script via the API or disabling this feature altogether.

There is currently no integrated support for "`rotated snapshots`".

Snapshot rollback gets scheduled like any other action, this means the
rollback usually does not happen immediately.
====



[[sd-snapshot-tags]]
== Snapshot Tags

Snapshot tags provide a means to add meaningful descriptions to your most
recent system snapshot.  This can be used to indicate milestones, such as a
known working configuration or a successful upgrade.

To tag the most recent snapshot, click [guimenu]``Create System Tag``, enter
a descriptive term in the [guimenu]``Tag name``, and click the btn:[Tag
Current Snapshot] button.  You may then revert using this tag directly by
clicking its name in the Snapshot Tags list.  To delete tags, select their
check boxes, click [guimenu]``Remove Tags``, and confirm the action.
