[[sd-configuration]]
= SD Configuration

This tab and its subtabs assist in managing the configuration files
associated with the system.  On Salt based systems, these configuration
files are distributed via a Configuration Channel.  On traditionally managed
systems, these configuration files may be managed solely for the current
system or distributed widely via a Configuration Channel.  The following
sections describe these and other available options on the menu:System
Details[Configuration] subtabs.

.Required Packages (Management)
[NOTE]
====
To manage the configuration of a system, it must have the latest
[package]#rhncfg*# packages installed.  For instructions on enabling and
disabling scheduled actions for a system, see
xref:reference:configuration/config-menu.adoc[].
====

This section is available to normal users with access to systems that have
configuration management enabled.  Like software channels, configuration
channels store files to be installed on systems.  While software updates are
provided by SCC, configuration files are managed solely by you.  Also unlike
with software packages, various versions of configuration files may prove
useful to a system at any time.  Only the latest version can be deployed.



[[sd-config-overview]]
== Configuration Overview

This subtab provides access to the configuration files of your system and to
the most common tasks used to manage configuration files.

Configuration Overview::
From the menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview], click the
[guimenu]``Add`` links to add files, directories, or symbolic links.  Here
you also find shortcuts to perform any of the common configuration
management tasks listed on the right of the screen by clicking one of the
links under menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview > Configuration
Actions].

[[sd-config-view-modify-files]]
== View/Modify Files

This subtab lists all configuration files currently associated with the
system.  These are sorted via subtabs in centrally and locally managed files
and a local sandbox for files under development.

Using the appropriate buttons on a subtab, you can copy from one to the
other subtabs.

[NOTE]
====
[guimenu]``Modify Files`` is not available on Salt based systems.
====

Centrally-Managed Files::
Centrally-managed configuration files are provided by global configuration
channels.  Determine which channel provides which file by examining the
[guimenu]``Provided By`` column below.  Some of these centrally-managed
files may be overridden by locally-managed files.  Check the
[guimenu]``Overridden By`` column to find out if any files are overridden,
or click btn:[Override this file] to provide such an overriding file.
+

Locally-Managed Files [Management]::
Locally-managed configuration files are useful for overriding
centrally-managed configuration profiles that cause problems on particular
systems.  Also, locally-managed configuration files are a method by which
system group administrators who do not have configuration administration
privileges can manage configuration files on the machines they can manage.
+
image::system_details_traditional_configuration_view_mod_local_paths.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Local Sandbox [Management]::
In the sandbox you can store configuration files under development.  You can
promote files from the sandbox to a centrally-managed configuration channel
using [guimenu]``Copy Latest to Central Channel``.  After files in this
sandbox have been promoted to a centrally-managed configuration channel, you
can deploy them to other systems.
+
Use [guimenu]``Copy Latest to System Channel`` to install a configuration on
the local system only.  When done, the file will end up on the
[guimenu]``Locally-Managed Files`` subtab.

[[sd-config-add-files]]
== Add Files

To upload, import, or create new configuration files, open the
[guimenu]``Add Files`` subtab.

Upload File::
To upload a configuration file from your local machine, browse for the
upload file, specify whether it is a text or binary file, enter
[guimenu]``Filename/Path`` and user and group ownership.  Specific file
permissions can be set.  When done, click btn:[Upload Configuration File].

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_add_files_upload.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Import Files::
Via the [guimenu]``Import Files`` tab, you can add files from the system you
have selected before and add it to the sandbox of this system.  Files will
be imported the next time [command]``mgr_check`` runs on the system.  To
deploy these files or override configuration files in global channels, copy
this file into your local override channel after the import has occurred.

In the text box under [guimenu]``Import New Files`` enter the full path of
any files you want import into {productname} or select deployable
configuration files from the [guimenu]``Import Existing Files`` list.  When
done, click btn:[Import Configuration Files].

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_add_files_import.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Create File::
Under [guimenu]``Create File``, you can directly create the configuration
file from scratch.  Select the file type, specify the path and file name,
where to store the file, plus the symbolic link target file name and path.
Ownership and permissions and macro delimiters need to be set.  For more
information on using macros, see
xref:reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros[].

In the [guimenu]``File Contents`` text box, type the configuration file.
Select the type of file you are creating from the drop-down box.  Possible
choices are Shell, Perl, Python, Ruby and XML.  When done, click btn:[Create
Configuration File].



[[sd-config-deploy-files]]
== Deploy Files

Under [guimenu]``Deploy Files`` you find all files that can be deployed on
the selected system.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_deploy_file.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Files from configuration channels with a higher priority take precedence
over files from configuration channels with a lower priority.



[[sd-config-compare-files]]
== Compare Files

This subtab compares a configuration file stored on the {productname} with
the file stored on the client.  It does not compare versions of the same
file stored in different channels.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_diff_file.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Select the files to be compared, click the btn:[Compare Files] button,
select a time to perform the diff, and click the btn:[Schedule Compare]
button to confirm.

For more on how to watch progress, see
xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-events.adoc[].  After the diff has
been performed, go to [guimenu]``Recent Events`` in
xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-events.adoc[] to see the results.



[[sd-config-manage-config-channels]]
== Manage Configuration Channels

This subtab allows you to subscribe to and rank configuration channels
associated with the system, lowest first.

image::system_details_traditional_configuration_config_channel_list.png[scaledwidth=80%]

The [guimenu]``List/Unsubscribe from Channels`` subtab contains a list of
the system's configuration channel subscriptions.  Click the check box next
to the Channel and click [guimenu]``Unsubscribe`` to remove the subscription
to the channel.

The [guimenu]``Subscribe to Channels`` subtab lists all available
configuration channels.  To subscribe to a channel, select the check box
next to it and click btn:[Continue].  To subscribe to all configuration
channels, click [guimenu]``Select All`` and click btn:[Continue].  The
[guimenu]``View/Modify Rankings`` page automatically loads.

The [guimenu]``View/Modify Rankings`` subtab allows users to set the
priority with which files from a particular configuration channel are
ranked.  The higher the channel is on the list, the more its files take
precedence over files on lower-ranked channels.  For example, the
higher-ranked channel may have an [path]``httpd.conf`` file that will take
precedence over the same file in a lower-ranked channel.
