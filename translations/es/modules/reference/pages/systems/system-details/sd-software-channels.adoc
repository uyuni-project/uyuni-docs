= SD Software Channels

Software channels provide a well-defined method to determine which packages
should be available to a system for installation or upgrade based on its
operating systems, installed packages, and functionality.

[IMPORTANT]
.Beta Testing Participants
====
When a product moves out of the beta program to a released version, the
repositories are updated with the new packages.  However, the repository
names do not change.  When a beta program is released, you will need to
refresh the software channels to get the updated packages.  You can do this
manually by running [command]``mgr-sync refresh`` and
[command]``spacewalk-repo-sync``.  Alternatively, these will be run
automatically by Taskomatic during the next regular refresh.

Click the chain icon right to a channel name to view its [guimenu]``Channel
Details`` page.  To change the base software channel the system is
subscribed to select a different base channel in the left selection box.

To modify the child channels associated with this system, in the right
selection box use the check boxes left to the channel names.  If you enable
[guimenu]``include recommended``, recommended child channels are
automatically selected for subscription.  Starting with {sle} 15, child
channels can depend on other channels—they are required.  In the channel
subscription you can see the dependencies by hovering with a mouse on a
child channel name.  Selecting a channel that depends on another channel
will select this channel, too.  Unselecting a channel on which some other
channels depend will also unselect those channels.

When done click btn:[Next] to schedule the Software Channel Change action.
Then click btn:[Confirm].

[NOTE]
.Changing the Channels Is Now an Action
====
Since the 3.1 maintenance update (2018) changing the channels is an action
that can be scheduled like any other action.  Earlier channel changes were
applied immediately.
