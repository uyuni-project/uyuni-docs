= SD Remote Command

This subtab allows you to run remote commands on the selected system. Before
doing so, you must first configure the system to accept such commands.

. On SLE clients, subscribe the system to the {productname} Tools child
  channel.  Then use Zypper to install the [systemitem]``rhncfg``,
  [systemitem]``rhncfg-client``, and [systemitem]``rhncfg-actions`` packages,
  if not already installed:
+

----
zypper in rhncfg rhncfg-client rhncfg-actions
----
+

On {rhela} clients, subscribe the system to the Tools child channel, and use
[command]``yum`` to install the [systemitem]``rhncfg``,
[systemitem]``rhncfg-client``, and [systemitem]``rhncfg-actions`` packages,
if not already installed:
+

----
yum install rhncfg rhncfg-client rhncfg-actions
----

. Log in to the system as root and add the following file to the local
  {productname} configuration directory:
  [path]``allowed-actions/scripts/run``.
+

* Create the necessary directory on the target system:
+

----
mkdir -p /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/script
----
+

* Create an empty [path]``run`` file in that directory to act as a flag to
  {productname}, signaling permission to allow remote commands:
+

----
touch /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/script/run
----

When the setup is complete, refresh the page to view the text boxes for
remote commands.  Identify a specific user, group, and timeout period, and
the script to run.  Select a date and time to execute the command, then
click btn:[Schedule] or add the remote command to an action chain.  For more
about action chains, see xref:reference:schedule/action-chains.adoc[].
