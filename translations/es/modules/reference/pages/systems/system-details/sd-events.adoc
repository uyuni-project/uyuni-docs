= SD Events

The [guimenu]``Events`` page displays past, current, and scheduled actions
on the system.  You may cancel pending events here.  The following sections
describe the [guimenu]``Events`` subtabs and the features they offer.



[[sd-events-pend]]
== Pending

Lists events that are scheduled but have not started.

A prerequisite action must complete successfully before the given action is
attempted.  If an action has a prerequisite, no check box is available to
cancel that action.  Instead, a check box appears next to the prerequisite
action; canceling the prerequisite action causes the action in question to
fail.

Actions can be chained so that action 'a' requires action 'b' which requires
action 'c'. Action 'c' is performed first and has a check box next to it
until it is completed successfully.  If any action in the chain fails, the
remaining actions also fail.  To unschedule a pending event, select the
event and click the btn:[Cancel Selected Events] button.  The following
icons indicate the type of events:

 -- System Event.


[[sd-events-hist]]
== History

The default display of the [guimenu]``Events`` tab lists the type and status
of events that have failed, occurred or are occurring.

History`` list.  To go back to the table again, click btn:[Return to history
list] at the bottom of the page.
