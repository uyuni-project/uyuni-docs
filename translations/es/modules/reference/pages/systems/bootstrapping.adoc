.Bootstrapping Parameters
Host::
Place the FQDN of the client to be bootstrapped within this field.

SSH Port::
Place the SSH port that will be used to connect and bootstrap a machine.
The default is ``22``.

User::
Input the clients user login.  The default is {rootuser}.

Authentication Method::
Select either ``Password`` or ``SSH Private Key``.

Password::
For password authentication, enter the client's login password.

SSH Private Key::
For SSH key authentication, copy the SSH private key.  The key is only
stored for as long as the bootstrapping process takes to complete.

SSH Private Key Passphrase::
For SSH authentication, enter the passphrase for the private key.

Activation Key::
Select the activation key (associated with a software source channel) that
the client should use to bootstrap with.

Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking::
This check box is selected by default.  This allows the script to
auto-accept host keys without requiring a user to manually authenticate.

Manage System Completely via SSH (Will not Install an Agent)::
If selected a system will automatically be configured to use SSH.  No other
connection method will be configured.

Once your client's connection details have been filled in click the
btn:[Bootstrap] button.  When the client has completed the bootstrap
process, find your new client listed on the menu:Systems[Overview] page.
