.Autoinstallation Types: {ay} and Kickstart
[NOTE]
====
In the following section, {ay} and {ay} features apply for {sle} client
systems only.  For {rhela} systems, use Kickstart and Kickstart features.
====


{ay} and Kickstart configuration files allow administrators to create an
environment for automating otherwise time-consuming system installations,
such as multiple servers or workstations.  {ay} files have to be uploaded to
be managed with {productname}.  Kickstart files can be created, modified,
and managed within the {productname} Web interface.

{productname} also features the Cobbler installation server.  For more
information, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].


{productname} provides an interface for developing Kickstart and {ay}
profiles that can be used to install {rhel} or {sle} on either new or
already-registered systems automatically according to certain
specifications.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have created Cobbler profiles, distributions, or systems using the
{productname} {webui}, you must manage them in the {webui}.  If you make
changes at the command prompt, the profiles will not synchronize correctly,
and the {webui} will show incorrect values.
