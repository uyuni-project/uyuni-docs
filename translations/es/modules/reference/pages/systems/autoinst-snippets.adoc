[[ref.webui.systems.autoinst.snippet]]
= Autoinstallation Snippets

Use snippets to store common blocks of code that can be shared across
multiple Kickstart or {ay} profiles in {productname}.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-snippet-default]]
== Default Snippets

Default snippets coming with {productname} are not editable.  You can use a
snippet, if you add the [guimenu]``Snippet Macro`` statement such as
`$SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script')` to your autoinstallation
profile.  This is an {ay} profile example:

----
<init-scripts config:type="list">
  $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script')
</init-scripts>
----

When you create a snippet with the [guimenu]``Create Snippet`` link, all
profiles including that snippet will be updated accordingly.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-snippet-custom]]
== Custom Snippets

This is the tab with custom snippets.  Click a name of a snippet to view,
edit, or delete it.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-snippet-all]]
== All Snippets

The [guimenu]``All Snippets`` tab lists default and custom snippets
together.
