[[ref.webui.systems.systems.x]]
= Systems List


Pages with various lists of system groupings.

[[ref.webui.systems.systems.all]]
== All

The menu:Systems[Systems > All] page contains the default set of your
systems.  It displays every system you have permission to manage.  You have
permission if you are the only user in your organization, if you are a
{productname} Administrator, or if the system belongs to a group for which
you have admin rights.

[[ref.webui.systems.systems.physical]]
== Physical Systems

To reach this page, select menu:Systems[Systems > Physical Systems] from the
left bar.  This page lists each physical system of which {productname} is
aware.

[[ref.webui.systems.systems.virtual]]
== Virtual Systems

To reach this page, select menu:Systems[Systems > Virtual Systems] from the
left bar.  This page lists each virtual host of which {productname} is aware
and the guest systems on those hosts.

image::systems_virtual_systems.png[scaledwidth=80%]

menu:System[]::
This column displays the name of each guest system.

menu:Updates[]::
This column shows whether there are patches (errata updates) available for
the guest systems that have not yet been applied.

menu:Status[]::
This column indicates whether a guest is running, paused, or stopped.

menu:Base Channel[]::
This column displays the base channel to which the guest is currently
subscribed.

Only guests registered with {productname} are displayed with blue text.
Clicking the host name of such a guest system displays its [guimenu]``System
Details`` page.



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.baremetal]]
== Unprovisioned Systems

Here, all unprovisioned (bare-metal) systems with hardware details are
listed.  For more information, see
xref:reference:admin/bare-metal-systems.adoc[].

[[ref.webui.systems.systems.ood]]
== Out of Date

The menu:Systems[Systems > Out of Date] page displays all systems where
applicable patch alerts have not been applied.

image::systems_outofdate.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.reboot]]
== Requiring Reboot

The menu:Systems[Systems > Requiring Reboot] page displays all systems that
need to be rebooted.  Click a system name to go to the systems details page
to schedule a reboot.

image::systems_requiringreboot.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.non_compliant]]
== Non-compliant Systems

Non-compliant systems have packages installed which are not available from
{productname}.  The [guimenu]``Packages`` column shows how many installed
packages are not available in the channels assigned to the system.  A
non-compliant system cannot be reinstalled.

image::systems_noncompliant.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.wst]]
== Without System Type

The menu:Systems[Systems > Without System Type] page displays systems
without a System Type.  System types are:

* Salt
* Management
* Foreign Host

image::systems_without_system_type.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.ungrp]]
== Ungrouped

The menu:Systems[Systems > Ungrouped] page displays systems that have not
yet been assigned to a system group.

image::systems_ungrouped.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.inact]]
== Inactive

The menu:Systems[Systems > Inactive Systems] page displays systems that have
not checked in with {productname} for 24 hours or more.

image::systems_inactive.png[scaledwidth=80%]

On traditional clients, checking in is performed periodically by client
tools (specifically `mgr_check`) - client systems connect to {productname}
to see if there are any updates available or if any actions have been
scheduled.  For Salt systems, a Taskomatic job checks on the clients
periodically by pinging them when otherwise inactive.  If you see a message
telling you that check-ins are not taking place, the system is not
successfully connecting to {productname}.

The reason may be one of the following:

* The system is not entitled to any {productname} service.  System profiles
  that remain unentitled for 180 days (6 months) are removed.
* The system is entitled, but [systemitem]``rhnsd`` has been disabled on the
  traditional client.  For more on restarting and troubleshooting, see
  xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-intro.adoc[].
* The system is behind a firewall that does not allow connections over
  [systemitem]``https`` (port 443).
* The system is behind an HTTP proxy server that has not been properly
  configured.
* The system is connected to a {productname} Proxy Server or {productname}
  that has not been properly configured.
* The system itself has not been properly configured, perhaps pointing at the
  wrong {productname} Server.
* The system is not in the network.
* Some other barrier exists between the system and the {productname} Server.
* For Salt clients, Taskomatic might not be operational.



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.rregistered]]
== Recently Registered

The menu:Systems[Systems > Recently Registered] page displays any systems
that have been registered in a given period.  Use the drop-down box to
specify the period in days, weeks, 30- and 180-day increments, and years.

image::systems_recently_registered.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.proxy]]
== Proxy

The menu:Systems[Systems > Proxy] page displays the {productproxy} Server
systems registered with your {productname} server.

image::systems_proxy.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.dup]]
== Duplicate Systems

The menu:Systems[Systems > Duplicate Systems] page lists current systems and
any active and inactive entitlements associated with them.

image::systems_duplicate_systems.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Active entitlements are in gray, while inactive entitlements are highlighted
in yellow and their check boxes checked by default for you to delete them as
needed by clicking the btn:[Delete Selected] button.  Entitlements are
inactive if the system has not checked in with {productname} in a time
specified via the drop-down box btn:[A system profile is inactive if its
system has not checked in for:].

You can filter duplicate entitlements by clicking the respective tab:

* menu:Duplicate Systems[IP Address]
* menu:Duplicate Systems[IPv6 Address]
* menu:Duplicate Systems[Hostname]
* menu:Duplicate Systems[MAC address]


You may filter further by inactive time or typing the system's host name, IP
address, IPv6 address, or MAC address in the corresponding [guimenu]``Filter
by`` text box.

To compare up to three duplicate entitlements at one time, click the
[guimenu]``Compare Systems`` link in the [guimenu]``Last Checked In``
column.  Inactive components of the systems are highlighted in yellow.

You can determine which systems are inactive or duplicate and delete them by
clicking the btn:[Delete System Profile] button.

Click the btn:[Confirm Deletion] button to confirm your choice.



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.currency]]
== System Currency

The System Currency Report displays an overview of severity scores of
patches relevant to the system.  The weighting is defined any systems,
[guimenu]``System Details`` page.  The default weight awards critical
security patches with the heaviest weight and enhancements with the lowest.
The report can be used to prioritize maintenance actions on the systems
registered to {productname}.

image::systems_currency_report.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[ref.webui.systems.systems.types]]
== System Types

System Types define the set of functionalities available for each system in
{productname} such as the ability of installing software or creating guest
virtual machines.

image::systems_system_types.png[scaledwidth=80%]

A list of profiled systems follows, with their base and add-on system types
shown in the appropriate columns.  To change system types, select the
systems you want to modify, and click either the btn:[Add System Type] or
btn:[Remove System Type] button.
