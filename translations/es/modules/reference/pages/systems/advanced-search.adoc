= Advanced Search

Carry out an [guimenu]``Advanced Search`` on your systems according to the
following criteria: network info, hardware devices, location, activity,
packages, details, DMI info, and hardware.

Refine searches using the [guimenu]``Field to Search`` drop-down box, which
is set to [guimenu]``Name/Description`` by default.

The Activity selections ([guimenu]``Days Since Last Check-in``, for example)
are useful in finding and removing outdated system profiles.

Type the keyword, select the criterion to search by, use the radio buttons
to specify whether you want to query all systems or only those in the
[guimenu]``System Set Manager``, and click the btn:[Search] button.  To list
all systems that do _not_ match the criteria, select the [guimenu]``Invert
Result`` check box.

The results appear at the bottom of the page.  For more on how to use the
system list, see xref:reference:systems/systems-list.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
If you add a distribution, newly synchronize channels, or register a system
with a {productname} server, it may take several minutes for it to be
indexed and appear in search results.  To force the rebuild of the search
index, enter [command]``rhn-search cleanindex`` on the command line and wait
until the rebuild is finished.
