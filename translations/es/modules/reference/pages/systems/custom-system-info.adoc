Unlike with notes, the information here is more formal and can be searched.
For example, you may decide to specify an asset tag for each system.  To do
so, select [guimenu]``Custom System Info`` from the left navigation bar and
create an `asset` key.

Click [guimenu]``Create Key`` in the upper-right corner of the page.  Enter
a suitable label and description, such as `Asset` and ``Precise location of
each system``, then click btn:[Create Key].  The key will show up in the
custom info keys list.

When the key exists, you may assign a value to it through the
[guimenu]``Custom Info`` tab of the [guimenu]``System Details`` page.  For
more on custom system information, see
xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-custom-info.adoc[].
