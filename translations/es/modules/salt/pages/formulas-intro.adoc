= Formulas


Formulas are collections of Salt States that have been pre-written by other
Salt users and contain generic parameter fields.  Formulas allow for
reliable reproduction of a specific configuration.  Formulas can be
installed from RPM packages or an external git repository.

Formulas work best for large, non-trivial, configurations.  For trivial
tasks, use a state rather than a formula.

Formula data can be managed using the XMLRPC API.

Formulas and states both act as a kind of configuration documentation.  When
you have written and stored the configuration, they provide a snapshot of
your infrastructure.

You can use the {productname} {webui} to apply common {productname}
formulas.  The most commonly used formulas are documented in this section.

Alternatively, you can use pre-written formulas as a starting point for your
own custom formulas.  Pre-written formulas are available from
https://github.com/saltstack-formulas.  For more information on custom
formulas, see xref:salt:formulas-custom.adoc[].
