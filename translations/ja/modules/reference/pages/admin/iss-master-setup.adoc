The menu:Admin[ISS Configuration > Master Setup] section is used to configure an inter-server synchronization (ISS) master.

To add new slaves to the master, click btn:[Add new slave]. You will need the slave's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

Check the [guimenu]``Allow Slave to Sync?`` checkbox to enable the slave to synchronize with the master.

Check the [guimenu]``Sync All Orgs to Slave?`` checkbox to synchronize all organizations to this slave.
