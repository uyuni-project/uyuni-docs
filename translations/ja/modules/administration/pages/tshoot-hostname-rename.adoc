= Troubleshooting Renaming {productname} Server



If you change the hostname of the {productname} Server locally, your {productname} installation ceases to work properly. This is because the changes have not been made in the database, which prevents the changes from propagating out your clients and any proxies.

If you need to change the hostname of the {productname} Server, you can do so using the [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script. This script updates the settings in the PostgreSQL database and the internal structures of {productname}.

The [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script is part of the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package.

The only mandatory parameter for the script is the newly configured IP address of the {productname} Server.



.Procedure: Renaming {productname} Server
. Change the network settings of the server on the system level locally and remotely at the DNS server.
    You also need to provide configuration settings for reverse name resolution. Changing network settings is done in the same way as with renaming any other system.
. Reboot the {productname} Server to use the new network configuration and to ensure the hostname has changed.
. Remove the old [package]``rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-<old_hostname>-<version>.noarch`` package:
+
----
zypper rm  package rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-<old_hostname>-<version>.noarch
----
+
Replace the [literal]``<old_hostname>`` and [literal]``<version>`` strings with the values of the package installed on your server.
. Run the script [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script with the public IP address of the server.
    If the server is not using the new hostname, the script fails.
. Re-configure your clients to make your environment aware of the new hostname and IP address.
+
In the Salt minion configuration file [path]``/etc/salt/minion``, you must make sure to specify the name of the new Salt master ({productname} Server):
+
----
master: <new_hostname>
----
+
Traditional clients have the [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date`` configuration file that must be changed. With a re-activation key you can re-register traditional clients (if there are any). For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-cli.adoc[].
. OPTIONAL: If you use PXE boot through a proxy, you must check the configuration settings of the proxy.
    On the proxy, run the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` setup script and enter the requested information. For more information, see xref:installation:proxy-setup.adoc[].
