{productname} is pre-installed on images that are available in the Public Cloud.
You do not need to perform any installation steps.
However, you must have the correct {productname} and {sle} entitlements to receive updates before you can manage client systems.

{productname} is only offered as bring your own subscription (BYOS) images.
Entitlements are provided by {suse} or a partner, you can use {scc} to obtain your entitlements.
{sle} system images for clients are generally available as on-demand or pay as you go (PAYG) images, or as bring your own subscription (BYOS) images.
If you are managing on-demand instances, the entitlement for the client is part of the on-demand pricing.
For on-demand instances you need to do some extra preparation before you can manage the system with {productname}.

An instance started from an on-demand image provided by {suse} is automatically registered, and the update infrastructure and {sle} modules are activated.
For {productname} clients, you need to disable this automation before you begin.



.Procedure: Preparing On Demand Images
. Log in to the on-demand instance.
. At the command prompt, as root, remove the registration data and repositories:
+
---
registercloudguest --clean
---
. Remove the ``cloud-regionsrv-client`` package:
+
----
zypper rm cloud-regionsrv-client
----
. Remove additional packages specific to your cloud provider:
+
* Amazon EC2:
+
----
zypper rm regionServiceClientConfigEC2 regionServiceCertsEC2
----
+
* Google Compute Engine:
+
----
zypper rm cloud-regionsrv-client-plugin-gce regionServiceClientConfigGCE regionServiceCertsGCE
----
+
* Microsoft Azure:
+
----
zypper rm regionServiceClientConfigAzure regionServiceCertsAzure
----

For instructions on registering {productname} to {scc}, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[].



.Procedure: Activating the Public Cloud Module
. On the {productname} Server, open the {yast} management tool, and navigate to menu:Software[Software Repositories].
. Click btn:[Add] and select [guimenu]``Extensions and Modules from Registration Server``.
. In the [guimenu]``Available extensions`` field, select [guimenu]``Public Cloud Module``.

If you prefer to use the command line, you can add the module with this command:
----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-public-cloud/15.2/x86_64
----

When the installation procedure has finished, you can check that you have all the required modules.
