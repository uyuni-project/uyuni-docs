= Traditional Contact Method (rhnsd)

For background information, see xref:architecture:rhnsd.adoc[].
*rhnsd* is used non-systemd systems; on later systems, a systemd timer ([systemitem]``rhnsd.timer``) is used.

The daemon is started by /etc/init.d/rhnsd, it does not use rhnsd.service. 




== The Default Contact Method

The {productname} *rhnsd* daemon runs on client systems and periodically connects with {productname} to check for new updates and notifications.
The daemon, which runs in the background, is started by *rhnsd.service*.
// FIXME: check it with the systemd.timer
////
By default, it will check every 4 hours for new actions, therefore it may take some time for your clients to begin updating after actions have been scheduled for them.
////

To check for updates, *rhnsd* runs the external *mgr_check* program located in `/usr/sbin/`.
This is a small application that establishes the network connection to {productname}.
The SUSE Manager daemon does not listen on any network ports or talk to the network directly.
All network activity is done via the *mgr_check* utility.

.Auto accepting (EULAs)
[WARNING]
====
When new packages or updates are installed on the client using {productname}, any end user licence agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted.
To review a package EULA, open the package detail page in the {webui}.
====

This figure provides an overview of the default *rhnsd* process path.
All items left of the *Python XMLRPC server* block represent processes running on an {productname} client.

=== Configuring {productname} rhnsd Daemon

The {productname} daemon can be configured by editing the file on the client:

----
/etc/sysconfig/rhn/rhnsd
----


This is the configuration file the rhnsd initialization script uses.
An important parameter for the daemon is its check-in frequency.
The default interval time is four hours (240 minutes). If you modify the configuration file, you must as {rootuser} restart the daemon with:

----
/etc/init.d/rhnsd restart
----

.Minimum Allowed Check-in Parameter
[IMPORTANT]
====
The minimum allowed time interval is one hour (60 minutes). If you set the interval below one hour, it will change back to the default of 4 hours (240 minutes).

=== Viewing rhnsd Daemon Status

As the {ruser} you may view the status of rhnsd by typing the command:
----
/etc/init.d/rhnsd status
----
