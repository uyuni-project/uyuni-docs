## üéØ Recommended Workflows

### Content Development (Fast Iteration)
```bash
# 1. Configure for your product
make configure-uyuni

# 2. Fast HTML-only builds during writing
make html-uyuni-en              # Quick preview of changes

# 3. Test specific PDF when needed  
make pdf-administration-uyuni-en

# 4. Clean when switching languages
make clean-en
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# 1. Validate structure
make validate-uyuni-en

# 2. Check style compliance  
make checkstyle

# 3. Build complete documentation
make antora-uyuni-en

# 4. Review all outputs
ls -la build/en/
```

### Production Release  
```bash
# 1. Configure for product
make configure-uyuni

# 2. Update translations
make translations

# 3. Build all languages for production
make obs-packages-uyuni-en &
make obs-packages-uyuni-ja &  
make obs-packages-uyuni-ko &
make obs-packages-uyuni-zh_CN &
wait

# 4. Package and distribute
ls -la build/packages/
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### Fast Development Cycle
- Use `html-*` targets during content development
- Only build PDFs when you need to review formatting  
- Use language-specific clean targets (`clean-en`) vs full clean
- Run parallel builds for different languages with `&`

### Troubleshooting Builds
- Use `DEBUG=1` to see full command output and error details
- Use `VERBOSE_LOG=1` for colored progress messages  
- Check individual PDF builds if complete build fails
- Use `validate-*` targets to check document structure

### CI/CD Optimizations
- Default commands work identically in Docker containers
- Colors automatically disabled in CI environments  
- Use `make obs-packages-*` for complete automated builds
- Exit codes properly propagate for build failure detection
