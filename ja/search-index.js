A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

The log files can only be a maximum file size of 16 MB, so a new log file is created when the files reach this size. Every time you create a new backup, previous backups are purged to release disk space. We recommend you use systemd timer on host system to schedule your smdba backups to ensure that your storage is managed effectively, and you always have a backup ready in case of failure. To access a shell inside the Server container, run mgrctl term on the container host. From there, run command line tools as usual. The smdba tool can be run in the container shell. We recommend you run a manual database backup immediately after installation, or if you have made any significant changes to your configuration. smdbaが初めて実行される場合、またはバックアップの場所を変更した場合は、アーカイブを実行する前にデータベースを再起動する必要があります。 この結果、わずかなダウンタイムが発生します。 通常のデータベースバックアップでは、ダウンタイムは必要ありません。 プロシージャ: データベースの手動バックアップの実行 バックアップ用の永続的なストレージ容量を割り当てます。 この例では、/var/spacewalk/にあるディレクトリを使用しています。 これはバックアップの永続的なターゲットになるため、常にサーバからアクセスできるようにしてください。 In the container terminal, enter: mgrctl term バックアップの場所で、バックアップのディレクトリを作成します。 rootとして: install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup バックアップの場所に適切な許可が設定されていることを確認します。 chown postgres:postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup 最初に、バックアップを作成するには、enableオプションセットを指定して、smdba backup-hotコマンドを実行します。 これにより、指定されたディレクトリにバックアップが作成されます。必要に応じて、データベースを再起動します。 smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup このコマンドはデバッグメッセージを生成し、次の出力で正常に終了します。 INFO: Finished バックアップファイルが/var/spacewalk/db-backupディレクトリに存在することを確認し、バックアップが成功したことを確認してください。 smdbaを使用してデータベースバックアップを実行するためにシステムをシャットダウンする必要はありません。 ただし、大規模な操作であるため、バックアップの実行中にデータベースのパフォーマンスが低下する可能性があります。 中断を最小限に抑えるために、定期的なデータベースバックアップを低トラフィック期間にスケジュールすることをお勧めします。 Ensure you have at least three times the current database size of space available for backups. You can check your current database size by running: mgrctl exec \"df -h /var/lib/pgsql\" Procedure: Creating a directory for the backup (do it only once) In the container terminal, enter: mgrctl term In your backup location, create a directory for the backup. As root, enter: install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup バックアップの場所に適切な許可が設定されていることを確認します。 chown postgres:postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup プロシージャ: 自動バックアップのスケジュール Create a system unit file at /etc/systemd/system/server-db-backup.service with the content: [Unit] Description=\"Server backup service\" [Service] ExecStart=mgrctl exec \"smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup\" Create a systemd timer file at /etc/systemd/system/server-db-backup.timer with the content: [Unit] Description=\"Run server database backup relative to activation time\" [Timer] OnCalendar=Mo..Sun *-*-* 2:00:00 Unit=server-db-backup.service [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target Check that all configuration are correct: systemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/server-db-backup.* Enable the timer: systemctl enable --now server-db-backup.timer smdbaツールを使用すると、障害が発生した場合にはバックアップから復元できます。 プロシージャ: バックアップから復元する In the container terminal, enter: mgrctl term データベースをシャットダウンします。 smdba db-stop 復元プロセスを開始して、完了するまで待機します。 smdba backup-restore start データベースを再起動します。 smdba db-start RPMとデータベース間に違いがあるかどうかを確認します。 spacewalk-data-fsck アーカイブログを使用すると、データベース管理ツールsmdbaでホットバックアップを実行できます。 Uyuniに埋め込みデータベースがある場合、デフォルトでアーカイブログは有効になっています。 PostgreSQLは限られた数のアーカイブ ログを維持します。 デフォルト設定を使用すると、サイズが16MiBの約64個のファイルが保存されます。 ユーザを作成し、チャンネルを同期します。 SLES12-SP2-Pool-x86_64 SLES12-SP2-Updates-x86_64 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool-x86_64-SP2 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates-x86_64-SP2 PostgreSQLは、追加で約1GBのデータを生成します。 したがって、バックアップ戦略について考え、定期的にバックアップを作成することが重要です。 アーカイブログは/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog/ (postgresql)に保存されます。 データベース管理者は、サブコマンドspace-overviewを使用して、占有されていたテーブルスペースに関するレポートを取得します。例: smdba space-overview 出力: SUSE Manager Database Control.

フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックして、［Include kernel security patch］（カーネルセキュリティパッチを含める）を選択します。 保存をクリックします。 ビルドをクリックして、環境を再構築します。 月次パッチサイクルが完了すると、次の月のパッチサイクルを更新できます。 プロシージャ: 月次パッチサイクルの更新 ［by date］（日付別）フィールドで、フィルタの日付を次の月に変更します。 または、新しいフィルタを作成して、プロジェクトへの割り当てを変更します。 SUSE-15-2019-1807の除外フィルタをプロジェクトから取り外すことができるかどうか確認します。 この問題を解決するために使用できる新しいパッチがある場合があります。 以前に追加した［許可］フィルタを取り外します。 パッチはデフォルトで含まれています。 プロジェクトを再構築して、来月のパッチを適用した新しい環境を作成します。 このセクションでは、ライブパッチ処理用の環境を作成するためのフィルタの設定について説明します。 ライブパッチ処理を使用する準備をしている場合には、いくつかの重要な考慮事項があります システムでカーネルバージョンを1つだけ使用してください。 ライブパッチ処理パッケージは、特定のカーネルとともにインストールされます。 ライブパッチ処理の更新は、1つのパッチとして出荷されます。 新しいシリーズのライブパッチ処理カーネルを開始するカーネルパッチごとに、要再起動フラグが表示されます。 これらのカーネルパッチには、ライブパッチ処理ツールが付属しています。 それらをインストールしたら、翌年になる前に少なくとも1回システムを再起動する必要があります。 インストール済みカーネルバージョンに一致するライブパッチ更新のみをインストールします。 ライブパッチは、スタンドアロンパッチとして提供されます。 現在インストールされているカーネルバージョンよりも新しいカーネルバージョンの通常のカーネルパッチをすべて除外する必要があります。 この例では、SUSE-15-2019-1244パッチでシステムを更新します。 このパッチには、kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64が含まれています。 より新しいバージョンのkernel-defaultを含むすべてのパッチを除外する必要があります。 プロシージャ: より新しいカーネルバージョンのパッケージを除外する Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル フィルタに移動して、Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックします。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドに、フィルタの名前を入力します。 たとえば、Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1（4.12.14-150.17.1より新しいカーネルを除外する）。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Patch (Contains Package)］（パッチ(パッケージを含む)）を選択します。 ［マッチャー］フィールドで、［version greater than］（指定したものより新しいバージョン）を選択します。 ［パッケージ名］フィールドに、「kernel-default」と入力します。 ［エポック］フィールドを空のままにします。 ［バージョン］フィールドに、「4.12.14」と入力します。 ［リリース］フィールドに、「 150.17.1」と入力します。 保存をクリックして、フィルタを保存します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックします。 ［Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1］（4.12.14-150.17.1より新しいカーネルを除外する）を選択して、保存をクリックします。 ビルドをクリックすると、新しい環境が作成されます。 新しい環境には、インストールしたバージョンまでのすべてのカーネルパッチが含まれています。 より新しいカーネルバージョンのすべてのカーネルパッチは削除されます。 ライブパッチ処理カーネルは、シリーズの最初でない限り、引き続き使用できます。 このプロシージャはフィルタテンプレートを使用して自動化できます。 ライブパッチ処理フィルタテンプレートの適用方法の詳細については、administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templatesを参照してください。 特定のカーネルバージョン用のライブパッチ処理は、1年間のみ利用できます。 1年後、システムのカーネルを更新する必要があります。 以下の環境変更を実行します。 プロシージャ: 新しいカーネルバージョンに切り替える アップグレードするカーネルバージョンを決定します。 例: 4.12.14-150.32.1 新しいカーネルバージョンフィルタを作成します。 以前のフィルタ ［Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1］（4.12.14-150.17.1より新しいカーネルを除外する）を取り外し、新しいフィルタを割り当てます。 ビルドをクリックして、環境を再構築します。 新しい環境には、選択した新しいカーネルバージョンまでのすべてのカーネルパッチが含まれています。 これらのチャンネルを使用しているシステムには、インストールに使用できるカーネル更新があります。 アップグレードを実行した後で、システムを再起動する必要があります。 新しいカーネルは1年間有効です。 その年にインストールされたすべてのパッケージは、現在のライブパッチ処理カーネルフィルタと一致します。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理プロジェクトでは、AppStreamフィルタを使用して、モジュラーリポジトリを通常のリポジトリに変換できます。これはパッケージをリポジトリに保持し、モジュールのメタデータを削除することにより行われます 。その結果作成されたリポジトリは、通常のリポジトリと同じ方法でUyuniで使用できます。 AppStreamリポジトリはWeb UI全体でネイティブにサポートされています。 したがって、このプロセスはAppStreamリポジトリを操作するために必須ではありません。 AppStreamフィルタはターゲットリポジトリに含める単一のモジュールストリームを選択します。 複数のフィルタを追加して、複数のモジュールストリームを選択できます。 CLMプロジェクトでAppStreamフィルタを使用しない場合は、モジュラーソースのモジュールメタデータは未加工のままで、ターゲットリポジトリには同じモジュールメタデータが含まれます。 CLMプロジェクトで少なくとも1つのAppStreamフィルタが有効になっている限り、すべてのターゲットリポジトリが通常のリポジトリに変換されます。 場合によっては、どのモジュールのパッケージも含めずに通常のリポジトリを構築したい場合があります。 これを行うには、マッチャー なし (モジュール化を無効にする)を使用して AppStreamフィルタを追加します。 これにより、ターゲットリポジトリ内のすべてのモジュールが無効になります。 これは、ほとんどのモジュールのデフォルトバージョンが通常のパッケージとしてAppStreamリポジトリにすでに含まれている、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9のクライアントに特に役立ちます。 AppStreamフィルタを使用するには、Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStreamsなどのモジュラーリポジトリを含むCLMプロジェクトが必要です。 開始する前に、必要なモジュールがソースとして含まれていることを確認してください。 プロシージャ: AppStreamフィルタの使用 Uyuni Web UIで、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8または9 CLMプロジェクトに移動します。 プロジェクトにAppStreamチャンネルが含まれていることを確認します。 Create Filter (フィルタの作成)をクリックし、次のパラメータを使用します。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドには、新しいフィルタの名前を入力します。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Module (Stream)］（モジュール(ストリーム)）を選択します。 ［ マッチャー］フィールドで、［等しい］を選択します。 ［モジュール名］フィールドに、モジュール名を入力します。 たとえば、postgresql。 ［ストリーム］フィールドに、目的のストリームの名前を入力します。 たとえば、10。 このフィールドを空のままにする場合、モジュールのデフォルトのストリームが選択されます。 保存をクリックして、新しいフィルタを作成します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックし、新しいAppStreamフィルタを選択して、保存をクリックします。 ［Create/Edit Filter］（フィルタの作成/編集）フォームのブラウズ機能を使用して、モジュラーチャンネルで使用可能なモジュールストリームのリストからモジュールを選択できます。 プロシージャ: 使用可能なモジュールストリームのブラウズ Uyuni Web UIで、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8または9 CLMプロジェクトに移動します。 プロジェクトにAppStreamチャンネルが含まれていることを確認します。 Create Filter (フィルタの作成)をクリックし、次のパラメータを使用します。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドには、新しいフィルタの名前を入力します。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Module (Stream)］（モジュール(ストリーム)）を選択します。 ［ マッチャー］フィールドで、［等しい］を選択します。 ［Browse available modules］（使用可能なモジュールをブラウズ）をクリックして、すべてのモジュラーチャンネルを表示します。 モジュールとストリームをブラウズするチャンネルを選択します。 ［モジュール名］フィールドで、検索するモジュール名の入力を開始するか、リストから選択します。 ［ストリーム］フィールドで、検索するストリーム名の入力を開始するか、リストから選択します。 チャンネル選択はモジュールのブラウズのみを目的としています。 選択したチャンネルはフィルタとともに保存されず、CLMプロセスには影響しません。 ターゲットリポジトリに含める他のモジュールストリーム用に追加のAppStreamフィルタを作成できます。 選択したストリームが依存するモジュールストリームは自動的に含まれます。 競合する、互換性のない、または欠落しているモジュールストリームを指定しないように注意してください。 たとえば、同じモジュールから2つのストリームを選択すると無効になります。 プロシージャ: モジュール化の無効化 Uyuni Web UIで、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8または9 CLMプロジェクトに移動します。 プロジェクトにAppStreamチャンネルが含まれていることを確認します。 Create Filter (フィルタの作成)をクリックし、次のパラメータを使用します。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドには、新しいフィルタの名前を入力します。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Module (Stream)］（モジュール(ストリーム)）を選択します。 ［マッチャー］フィールドで、［なし (モジュール化を無効にする)］を選択します。 保存をクリックして、新しいフィルタを作成します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックし、新しいAppStreamフィルタを選択して、保存をクリックします。 これにより、モジュールに属するパッケージを除いて、モジュールのメタデータがターゲットリポジトリから効率的に削除されます。 Web UIのビルドボタンを使用してCLMプロジェクトを構築する場合、ターゲットリポジトリは、選択したモジュールストリームからのパッケージを含む、モジュールを含まない通常のリポジトリです。 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8のプロジェクトでモジュール化を完全に無効にすると、一部のモジュールが Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8での正常な動作に不可欠であるため、環境に不具合が生じる可能性があります。","title":"コンテンツライフサイクル管理の例","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

これは、限られたメンテナンスウィンドウ中に更新を適用する必要がある場合に特に役立ちます。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理では、ソフトウェアチャンネルをソースとして選択し、必要に応じて環境に合わせて調整して、運用クライアントにインストールする前に徹底的にテストすることがでます。 ベンダチャンネルを直接変更することはできませんが、パッケージとカスタムパッチを追加または削除することで、それらのチャンネルのクローンを作成し、クローンを変更することができます。 これらのクローンチャンネルをテストクライアントに割り当てて、クライアントが期待どおりに動作することを確認できます。 デフォルトでは、クローンベンダチャンネルは元のベンダチャンネルと一致し、依存関係を自動的に選択します。 /etc/rhn/rhn.confに次のオプションを追加することにより、クローンチャンネルの自動選択を無効にできます。 java.cloned_channel_auto_selection = false 次に、すべてのテストに合格すると、クローンチャンネルを運用サーバにプロモートできます。 これは、ソフトウェアチャンネルがライフサイクルで移動できる一連の環境を通じて実現されます。 ほとんどの環境ライフサイクルには、少なくともテスト環境と運用環境が含まれていますが、必要な数の環境を持つことができます。 このセクションでは、基本的なコンテンツライフサイクル手順、および使用可能なフィルタについて説明します。 より具体的な例については、コンテンツライフサイクル管理の例を参照してください。 コンテンツライフサイクルを設定するには、プロジェクトから開始する必要があります。 プロジェクトでは、ソフトウェアチャンネルソース、パッケージの検索に使用されるフィルタ、およびビルド環境について定義します。 プロシージャ: コンテンツライフサイクルプロジェクトの作成 Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動し、プロジェクトの作成をクリックします。 ［ラベル］フィールドに、プロジェクトのラベルを入力します。 ［ラベル］フィールドには、小文字、数字、ピリオド、ハイフン、およびアンダースコアのみを入力できます。 ［ 名前］フィールドに、プロジェクトのわかりやすい名前を入力します。 作成ボタンをクリックして、プロジェクトを作成し、プロジェクトページに戻ります。 Attach/Detach Sources（ソースの割り当て/取り外し）をクリックします。 ［ソース］ダイアログで、ソースタイプを選択し、プロジェクトの ベースチャンネルを選択します。 チャンネルが必須か推奨されるかに関する情報を含め、選択したベースチャンネルで使用可能な子チャンネルが表示されます。 必要な子チャンネルをオンにし、保存をクリックして、プロジェクトページに戻ります。 選択したソフトウェアチャンネルが表示されているはずです。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックします。 ［フィルタ］ダイアログで、プロジェクトに割り当てるフィルタを選択します。 新しいフィルタを作成するには、新しいフィルタの作成をクリックします。 環境の追加をクリックします。 ［環境ライフサイクル］ダイアログで、最初の環境に、名前、ラベル、および説明を付けて、保存をクリックします。 ［ラベル］フィールドには、小文字、数字、ピリオド、ハイフン、およびアンダースコアのみを入力できます。 ライフサイクルのすべての環境が完了するまで、環境の作成を続行します。 作成時に［前に挿入］フィールドで環境を選択することで、ライフサイクルの環境の順序を選択できます。 Uyuniでは、プロジェクトの構築に使用するコンテンツを制御するために、さまざまなタイプのフィルタを作成できます。 フィルタを使用すると、ビルドに含めるパッケージまたはビルドから除外するパッケージを選択できます。 たとえば、すべてのカーネルパッケージを除外したり、一部のパッケージの特定のリリースのみを含めることができます。 サポートされているフィルタは次のとおりです。 パッケージのフィルタリング by name（名前別） by name, epoch, version, release, and architecture（名前、エポック、バージョン、リリース、およびアーキテクチャ別） by provided name（指定された名前別） パッチフィルタリング by advisory name（アドバイザリ名別） by advisory type（アドバイザリタイプ別） by synopsis（概要別） by keyword（キーワード別） by date（日付別） by affected package（影響を受けるパッケージ別） モジュール by stream（ストリーム別） パッケージの依存は、コンテンツのフィルタリング中には解決されません。 フィルタで使用できるマッチャーは複数あります。 使用できるマッチャーは、選択したフィルタ タイプによって異なります。 使用できるマッチャーは次のとおりです。 含む 一致（正規表現の形式を取る必要があります） 等しい 新しい 新しいか等しい 古いか等しい 古い 新しいか等しい 各フィルタには許可または拒否のいずれかに設定できるruleパラメータがあります。 フィルタは次のように処理されます。 パッケージまたはパッチが拒否フィルタを満たす場合は、結果から除外されます。 パッケージまたはパッチが許可フィルタを満たす場合は、結果に含まれます（拒否フィルタによって除外された場合でも）。 この動作は、一般的な 拒否 フィルタを使用して多数のパッケージまたはパッチを除外し、特定の 許可 フィルタで特定のパッケージまたはパッチを「チェリーピック」する場合に役立ちます。 コンテンツフィルタは組織内でグローバルなものであり、プロジェクト間で共有できます。 プロジェクトにすでに構築されたソースが含まれている場合、環境を追加すると、既存のコンテンツが自動的に入力されます。 コンテンツは、サイクルの以前の環境から引き出されます（存在していた場合）。 以前の環境がない場合は、プロジェクトソースが再度構築されるまで空のままになります。 いくつかの一般的なシナリオでフィルタの作成を支援するため、Uyuniにはフィルタテンプレートが用意されています。 これらのテンプレートを適用すると、特定のユースケースに合わせてカスタマイズされた一連のフィルタを事前に作成できます。 このセクションでは、使用可能なテンプレートとその使用方法について説明します。 ライブパッチ処理を含むプロジェクトでは、ライブパッチパッケージのみがクライアントに更新として提供されるように、定期的な将来のカーネルパッケージを除外する必要があります。 一方で、システムの整合性を維持するために、すでにインストールされている通常のカーネルパッケージを含める必要があります。 このテンプレートを適用すると、この動作を実現するために必要な3つのフィルタが作成されます。 ベースカーネルバージョンと同じkernel-defaultパッケージを含むパッチを許可する reboot_suggestedキーワードを含むパッチを拒否する installhint(reboot-needed)という名前を提供するパッケージを含むパッチを拒否する ライブパッチ処理プロジェクトの設定方法の詳細については、administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-versionを参照してください。 プロシージャ: テンプレートの適用 Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル フィルタに移動して、Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックします。 ダイアログで、テンプレートを使用するをクリックします。それに応じて入力が変更されます。 ［プレフィクス］フィールドに名前のプレフィクスを入力します。 この値は、テンプレートによって作成された個々のフィルタの名前の前に追加されます。 テンプレートがプロジェクトのコンテキストで適用されている場合、このフィールドにはプロジェクトラベルが事前に入力されます。 ［テンプレート］フィールドで、［SUSE製品に基づくライブパッチ処理］を選択します。 ［製品］フィールドで、ライブパッチ処理を設定する製品を選択します。 ［カーネル］フィールドで、選択した製品で使用可能なバージョンのリストからカーネルバージョンを選択します。以降の通常のカーネルパッチを拒否するフィルタは、このバージョンに基づきます。 保存をクリックして、フィルタを作成します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックします。 指定したプレフィクスを持つフィルタを3つ選択し、保存をクリックします。 特定の登録済みシステムにインストールされているカーネルバージョンに基づいてライブパッチ処理プロジェクトを設定する場合、「システムに基づくライブパッチ処理」テンプレートを使用できます。 このテンプレートを適用すると、この動作を実現するために必要な3つのフィルタが作成されます。 ベースカーネルバージョンと同じkernel-defaultパッケージを含むパッチを許可する reboot_suggestedキーワードを含むパッチを拒否する installhint(reboot-needed)という名前を提供するパッケージを含むパッチを拒否する ライブパッチ処理プロジェクトの設定方法の詳細については、administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-versionを参照してください。 プロシージャ: テンプレートの適用 Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル フィルタに移動して、Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックします。 ダイアログで、テンプレートを使用するをクリックします。 それに応じて入力が変更されます。 ［プレフィクス］フィールドに、名前のプレフィクスを入力します。 この値はテンプレートによって作成されたすべてのフィルタの名前の前に追加されます。 テンプレートがプロジェクトのコンテキストで適用されている場合は、このフィールドにはプロジェクトラベルが事前に入力されます。 ［テンプレート］フィールドで、［固有のシステムに基づくライブパッチ処理］を選択します。 ［システム］フィールドで、リストからシステムを選択するか、システム名の入力を開始して、オプションを絞り込みます。 ［カーネル］フィールドで、選択したシステムにインストールされているバージョンのリストからカーネルバージョンを選択します。 以降の通常のカーネルパッチを拒否するフィルタは、このバージョンに基づきます。 保存をクリックして、フィルタを作成します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックします。 指定したプレフィクスを持つフィルタを3つ選択し、保存をクリックします。 プロジェクトに含まれているモジュラーリポジトリですべてのモジュールを使用できるようにする場合は、このフィルタテンプレートを使用してモジュールを自動的に追加できます。 このテンプレートを適用すると、モジュールごとにAppStreamフィルタとそのデフォルトストリームが作成されます。 このプロセスがプロジェクトのページから実行された場合、フィルタは自動的にプロジェクトに追加されます。追加されない場合は、作成されたフィルタをコンテンツライフサイクル フィルタに一覧表示し、必要に応じて任意のプロジェクトに追加できます。 個々のフィルタを編集して別のモジュールストリームを選択したり、ターゲットリポジトリからそのモジュールを除外するために完全に削除したりできます。 すべてのモジュールストリームが相互に互換性があるわけではないため、個々のストリームを変更すると、モジュール間依存関係を正常に解決できない可能性があります。 この場合、プロジェクトの詳細ページのフィルタペインに問題を説明するエラーが表示され、すべてのモジュールの選択が互換性を持つようになるまでビルドボタンは無効になります。 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9以降、モジュールには定義済みのデフォルトストリームがありません。 したがって、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9のソースでこのテンプレートを使用しても効果はありません。 AppStreamリポジトリをコンテンツライフサイクル管理で設定する方法の詳細については、administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filtersを参照してください。 プロシージャ: テンプレートの適用 UyuniのWeb UIで、Content Lifecycle Projectsに移動し、プロジェクトを選択します。 ［フィルタ］セクションで、フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックし、新しいフィルタの作成をクリックします。 ダイアログで、テンプレートを使用するをクリックします。 それに応じて入力が変更されます。 ［プレフィクス］フィールドに、名前のプレフィクスを入力します。 この値はテンプレートによって作成されたすべてのフィルタの名前の前に追加されます。 テンプレートがプロジェクトのコンテキストで適用されている場合は、このフィールドにはプロジェクトラベルが事前に入力されます。 ［テンプレート］フィールドで、［デフォルトのAppStreamモジュール］を選択します。 ［チャンネル］フィールドで、モジュールを取得するモジュラーチャンネルを選択します。このドロップダウンには、モジュラーチャンネルのみが表示されます。 保存をクリックして、フィルタを作成します。 ［フィルタ］セクションまでスクロールして、新しく割り当てられたAppStreamフィルタを確認します。 個々のフィルタを編集/削除して、ニーズに合わせてプロジェクトを調整できます。 プロジェクトを作成し、環境を定義し、ソースとフィルタを割り当てたら、初めてプロジェクトを構築できます。 構築によって、割り当てられたソースにフィルタが適用され、プロジェクトの最初の環境にそれらが複製されます。 複数のコンテンツプロジェクトのソースとして同じベンダチャンネルを使用できます。 この場合、Uyuniはクローンチャンネルごとに新しいパッチクローンを作成しません。 代わりに、1つのパッチクローンがすべてのクローンチャンネル間で共有されます。 これにより、パッチが撤回された場合やパッチ内のパッケージが変更された場合など、ベンダがパッチを変更すると問題が発生する可能性があります。 コンテンツプロジェクトの1つを構築すると、コンテンツプロジェクトの他の環境や組織内の他のコンテンツプロジェクトチャンネルにチャンネルがある場合でも、クローンパッチを共有するすべてのチャンネルがデフォルトでオリジナルと同期されます。 この動作は、組織の設定で自動パッチ同期をオフにすることで変更できます。 パッチを共有しているすべてのチャンネルのパッチを後で手動で同期するには、ソフトウェア 管理 チャンネルに移動し、同期するチャンネルをクリックして、［同期］サブタブに移動します。 パッチを手動で同期しても、パッチを共有するすべての組織チャンネルに影響します。 プロシージャ: コンテンツライフサイクルプロジェクトの構築 Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動し、構築するプロジェクトを選択します。 プロジェクトを構築する前に、利用可能な環境があることを確認してください。 割り当てられたソースとフィルタを確認し、ビルドをクリックします。 このビルドの変更または更新を説明するバージョンメッセージを提供します。 ［ 環境ライフサイクル ］セクションでビルドの進行状況を監視できます。 ビルドが完了すると、環境バージョンが1つ増え、ソフトウェアチャンネルなどのビルドソースをクライアントに割り当てることができます。 プロジェクトが構築されると、構築されたソースを順次、環境にプロモートできます。 プロシージャ: 環境のプロモート Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動し、作業するプロジェクトを選択します。 ［環境ライフサイクル］セクションで、後継環境にプロモートする環境を見つけ、Promote（プロモート）をクリックします。 ［ 環境ライフサイクル ］セクションでビルドの進行状況を監視できます。 コンテンツライフサイクルプロジェクトを構築およびプロモートすると、Uyuniはソフトウェアチャンネルのツリーを作成します。 クライアントを環境に追加するには、クライアントの［システムの詳細］ページのソフトウェア ソフトウェアチャンネルを使用して、ベースソフトウェアチャンネルと子ソフトウェアチャンネルをクライアントに割り当てます。 新たに追加されたクローンチャンネルはクライアントに自動的に割り当てられません。 ソースを追加またはプロモートする場合は、チャンネル割り当てを手動で確認して更新する必要があります。 自動割り当ては、今後のバージョンでUyuniに追加される予定です。","title":"コンテンツライフサイクル管理","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

カスタムチャンネルを作成および管理できるようにするには、管理者権限が必要です。 カスタムチャンネルを作成する前に、関連付けるベースチャンネルと、コンテンツに使用するリポジトリを決定します。 クライアントシステムにインストールする必要があるカスタムソフトウェアパッケージがある場合は、カスタム子チャンネルを作成して管理できます。 システムにチャンネルを割り当てる前に、Uyuni Web

［親チャンネル］ドロップダウンで、関連するベースチャンネル(たとえば、SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64)を選択します。 パッケージに互換性のある親チャンネルを選択していることを確認します。 ［アーキテクチャ］ドロップダウンで、適切なハードウェアアーキテクチャ(たとえば、x86_64)を選択します。 ご使用の環境に応じて、連絡先の詳細、チャンネルアクセス制御、およびGPGフィールドに追加情報を入力します。 チャンネルの作成をクリックします。 カスタムチャンネルでは、追加のセキュリティ設定が必要になる場合があります。 多くのサードパーティベンダは、GPGを使用してパッケージをセキュリティ保護しています。 カスタムチャンネルでGPGで保護されたパッケージを使用する場合は、メタデータの署名に使用されたGPGキーを信頼する必要があります。 次に、［メタデータは署名されていますか？］チェックボックスをオンにして、パッケージメタデータを信頼できるGPGキーと照合します。 リモートチャンネルおよびリポジトリがGPGキーで署名されている場合、これらのGPGキーをインポートして信頼することができます。 たとえば、Uyuniサーバのコマンドラインからspacewalk-repo-syncを実行します。 /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync -c -t yum 基盤となるzypperコールは、利用可能な場合はキーをインポートします。 Web UIはこの機能を提供していません。 これは、ミラーするリポジトリが特別な方法で設定されていて、署名の横のリポジトリに「キー」が提供されている場合にのみ機能します 。これは、Open Build Service (OBS)によって生成されたすべてのリポジトリに該当します。その他のリポジトリについては、特別な準備ステップが必要です(以下を参照)。 デフォルトでは、新しいチャンネルを作成する際に［GPGチェックの有効化］フィールドがオンになっています。 チャンネルにカスタムパッケージとアプリケーションを追加する場合は、このフィールドをオフにして、署名されていないパッケージをインストールできるようにしてください。 パッケージが信頼されていないソースからのものである場合、GPGチェックを無効にするとセキュリティリスクが生じます。 リポジトリが有効なソフトウェアリポジトリである場合は、Web UIを使用してUyuniに追加することのみできます。 必要なリポジトリメタデータが使用できることを事前に確認してください。 これに関しては、createrepoやrepreproなどのツールが便利です。 mgrpushはリポジトリを作成せずに単一のRPMをチャンネルにプッシュするのに役立ちます。 詳細については、createrepo_cおよびrepreproのマニュアルページを参照してください。 プロシージャ: ソフトウェアリポジトリの追加 Uyuni Web UIで、ソフトウェア 管理 リポジトリに移動し、リポジトリの作成をクリックします。 ［リポジトリの作成］ページで、リポジトリにラベル(たとえば、my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo)を付けます。 ［リポジトリURL］フィールドに、repodataファイル(たとえば、file:///opt/mytools/)を含むディレクトリへのパスを指定します。 このフィールドでは、任意の有効なアドレス指定プロトコルを使用できます。 ［メタデータは署名されていますか？］チェックボックスをオフにします。 オプション: リポジトリでクライアント証明書認証が必要な場合は、SSLフィールドに入力します。 リポジトリの作成をクリックします。 先に示したプロシージャは、ミラーリングするリポジトリが署名の横にあるリポジトリに「キー」を提供する場合にのみ機能します。これはOBSによって生成されたすべてのリポジトリに該当しますが、通常、OBSによって提供されていないオペレーティングシステムの他のリポジトリには該当しません。 使用するリポジトリにGPGキーがない場合は、自分でGPGキーを指定し、GPGキーをキーリングに手動でインポートできます。gpgコマンドラインツールを使用して/var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdirキーリングにキーをインポートすると、永続的に保存されます。chroot環境が消去されても、キーは保持されます。 プロシージャ: GPGキーを使用してソフトウェアリポジトリを作成する

The Kiwi build type is used to build system, virtual, and other images. The image store for the Kiwi build type is pre-defined as a file system directory at /srv/www/os-images on the server. Uyuni serves the image store over HTTPS from https:///os-images/. The image store location is unique and is not customizable. イメージは/srv/www/os-image/ORGANIZATION-IDに保存されます。 コンテナ機能は、SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12以降を実行しているSaltクライアントで使用できます。 開始する前に、ご使用の環境が次の要件を満たしていることを確認してください。 Dockerfileと設定スクリプトを含む発行済みのgitリポジトリ。 リポジトリはパブリックにもプライベートにもでき、GitHub、GitLab、またはBitBucketでホストする必要があります。 Dockerレジストリなどの適切に設定されたイメージストア。 For more information on containers, see https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/html/Container-guide/. Uyuniでイメージを構築するには、構築ホストを作成して設定する必要があります。 コンテナビルドホストは、SUSE Linux Enterprise 12以降を実行しているSaltクライアントです。 このセクションでは、構築ホストの初期設定について説明します。 構築ホスト上のオペレーティングシステムは、ターゲットイメージ上のオペレーティングシステムと一致する必要があります。 たとえば、SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SP2以降)のOSバージョンを実行している構築ホスト上にSUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15ベースのイメージを構築します。 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5またはSUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 OSバージョンを実行している構築ホスト上にSUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12ベースのイメージを構築します。 クロスアーキテクチャビルドはサポートされていません。 Uyuni Web UIから、次のステップを実行して、構築ホストを設定します。 プロシージャ: ホストの構築 Select a Salt client to be designated as a build host from the Systems Systems overview page. From the System Details page of the selected client assign the containers modules. Navigate to Software Software Channels and enable the containers module (for example, SLE-Module-Containers15-Pool and SLE-Module-Containers15-Updates). Continue with Next. Schedule the Software Channel Change, and click Confirm. From the System Details tab select Properties page, and enable Container Build Host from the Add-on System Types list. Confirm by clicking Update Properties. Install all required packages by applying Highstate. From the system details tab select States Highstate, and click Apply Highstate. Alternatively, apply Highstate from the Uyuni Server command line: salt '$your_client' state.highstate The containers built with Uyuni use channels associated to the activation key as repositories when building the image. This section guides you through creating an ad-hoc activation key for this purpose. コンテナを構築するには、SUSE Manager Default以外のチャンネルに関連付けられているアクティベーションキーが必要です。 プロシージャ: アクティベーションキーの作成 システム アクティベーションキーを選択します。 キーの作成をクリックします。 ［説明］と［キー］名を入力します。 ドロップダウンメニューを使用してこのキーと関連付ける［ベースチャンネル］を選択します。 アクティベーションキーの作成で確定します。 詳細については、アクティベーションキーを参照してください。 すべての構築されたイメージは、イメージストアにプッシュされます。 このセクションでは、イメージストアの作成について説明します。 プロシージャ: イメージストアの作成 イメージ ストアを選択します。 ［作成］をクリックして、新しいストアを作成します。 ［ラベル］フィールドにイメージストアの名前を定義します。 コンテナレジストリホスト(内部か外部)の完全修飾ドメイン名(FQDN)として、［URI］フィールドに入力して、イメージレジストリへのパスを指定します。 registry.example.com レジストリURI を使用して、すでに使用されているレジストリのイメージストアを指定することもできます。 registry.example.com:5000/myregistry/myproject 作成をクリックして、新しいイメージストアを追加します。 すべてのコンテナイメージは、構築手順を含む、イメージプロファイルを使用して構築されます。 このセクションでは、Uyuni Web UIでイメージプロファイルを作成する方法について説明します。 プロシージャ: イメージプロファイルの作成 イメージプロファイルを作成するには、イメージ プロファイルを選択し、作成をクリックします。 ［ラベル］フィールドに入力して、イメージプロファイルの名前を指定します。 コンテナイメージタグがmyproject/myimageなどの形式である場合は、イメージストアのレジストリURIに/myprojectサフィックスが含まれていることを確認します。 Use Dockerfile as the Image Type. Use the drop-down menu to select your registry from the Target Image Store field. In the Path field, type a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository URL. The path can also be a local directory on the build host. The URL should be http, https, or a token authentication URL.

OpenSCAPパッケージ オペレーティングシステム スキャナ コンテンツ SLES openscap-utils scap-security-guide openSUSE openscap-utils scap-security-guide RHEL openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat CentOS openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Oracle Linux openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Ubuntu libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-ubuntu Debian libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-debian RHEL 7および互換システムでは、scap-security-guideパッケージが提供されています。このパッケージには、古い内容が含まれています。 Uyuniクライアントツールにあるscap-security-guide-redhatパッケージを使用することをお勧めします。 SUSEは、異なるOpenSCAPプロファイル用の scap-security-guideパッケージを提供しています。 scap-security-guideの現在のバージョンでは、SUSEは次のプロファイルをサポートしています。 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12および15のDISA STIGプロファイル SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12および15のANSSI-BP-028プロファイル SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12および15のPCI-DSSプロファイル SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15のHIPAAプロファイル SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12および15のCISプロファイル SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15のパブリッククラウドイメージ用の強化 SUSE Linux Enterprise 15用のパブリッククラウドの強化 SLE 12および15の標準のシステムセキュリティプロファイル このリストに記載されていない他のプロファイルは、コミュニティが提供するものであり、SUSEによって公式にサポートされていません。 SUSE以外のオペレーティングシステムの場合、含まれるプロファイルはコミュニティが提供します。 これらはSUSEによって公式にサポートされていません。 OpenSCAPは、SCAPコンテンツファイルを使用してテストルールを定義します。 これらのコンテンツファイルは、XCCDFまたはOVAL標準に基づいて作成されます。 『SCAPセキュリティガイド』に加えて、公開されているコンテンツファイルをダウンロードして、要件に合わせてカスタマイズできます。 デフォルトのコンテンツファイルテンプレート用のSCAPセキュリティガイドパッケージをインストールできます。 または、XCCDFまたはOVALに精通している場合は、独自のコンテンツファイルを作成できます。 テンプレートを使用してSCAPコンテンツファイルを作成することをお勧めします。 独自のカスタムコンテンツファイルを作成して使用する場合は、自己責任で作成してください。 カスタムコンテンツファイルを使用してシステムが破損した場合、SUSEのサポートを受けられない可能性があります。 コンテンツファイルを作成したら、ファイルをクライアントに転送する必要があります。 これは、物理的なストレージメディアを使用して他のファイルを移動するのと同じ方法で行うことができます。または、Salt (たとえば、salt-cpやSalt File Server)、ftpやscpを使用してネットワークを介して移動することもできます。 Uyuniで管理しているクライアントにコンテンツファイルを配布するパッケージを作成することをお勧めします。 パッケージの整合性を確認するために、パッケージに署名して検証することができます。 詳細については、カスタムチャンネルを参照してください。 オペレーティングシステムによって、使用可能なOpenSCAPコンテンツファイルとプロファイルが異なります。 1つのコンテンツファイルに複数のプロファイルを含めることができます。 RPMベースのオペレーティングシステムでは、次のコマンドを使用して、使用可能なSCAPファイルの場所を決定します。 rpm -ql DEBベースのオペレーティングシステムでは、次のコマンドを使用して、使用可能なSCAPファイルの場所を決定します。 dpkg -L ニーズに合う1つの SCAPコンテンツファイルを特定したら、クライアントに使用可能なプロファイルを一覧にします。 oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml Document

プロシージャ: Web UIからの監査スキャンの実行 Uyuni Web UIで、システム システム一覧に移動して、スキャンするクライアントを選択します。 ［監査］タブ、および［スケジュール］サブタブに移動します。 ［XCCDFドキュメントへのパス］フィールドに、クライアントで使用するSCAPテンプレートとプロファイルのパラメータを入力します。 例: Command: /usr/bin/oscap xccdf eval Command-line arguments: --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig Path to XCCDF document: /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml --fetch-remote-resourcesパラメータを使用する場合は、大量のRAMが必要です。 さらに、file_recv_max_sizeの値を増やす必要がある場合があります。 スキャンは、クライアントの次にスケジュールされた同期時に実行されます。 XCCDFコンテンツファイルはリモートシステムで実行される前に検証されます。 コンテンツファイルに無効な引数が含まれている場合は、テストに失敗します。 プロシージャ: APIからの監査スキャンの実行 開始する前に、スキャンするクライアントにPythonおよびXML-RPCライブラリがインストールされていることを確認します。 既存のスクリプトを選択するか、system.scap.scheduleXccdfScanを使用してシステムスキャンをスケジュールするスクリプトを作成します。 例: #!/usr/bin/python3 client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('https://server.example.com/rpc/api') key = client.auth.login('username', 'password') client.system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan(key, , '', '--profile ') この例では: * はシステムID (sid)です。 * は、クライアント上のコンテンツファイルの場所へのパスです。 たとえば、/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml。 * はoscapコマンドの追加の引数です。 たとえば、united_states_government_configuration_baseline (USGCB)を使用します。 コマンドプロンプトから、スキャンするクライアント上でスクリプトを実行します。 実行したスキャンに関する情報は、Uyuni Web UIにあります。 結果の表を表示するには、監査 OpenSCAP 全スキャンに移動します。 この表のデータの詳細については、All Scansを参照してください。 スキャンに関する詳細情報を使用できるようにするには、クライアントで有効にする必要があります。 Uyuni Web UIで、管理 組織に移動し、クライアントが属する組織をクリックします。 ［設定］タブに移動し、［詳細なSCAPファイルのアップロードを有効にする］オプションをオンにします。 有効にすると、スキャンごとに、追加情報を含む追加のHTMLファイルが生成されます。 結果には、次のような追加の行が表示されます。 Detailed Results: xccdf-report.html xccdf-results.xml scap-yast2sec-oval.xml.result.xml コマンドラインからスキャン情報を取得するには、spacewalk-reportコマンドを使用します。 spacewalk-report system-history-scap spacewalk-report scap-scan spacewalk-report scap-scan-results Uyuni APIを使用して、system.scapハンドラを使用して結果を表示することもできます。 クライアントシステムを強化するために、修復用のBashスクリプトとAnsible playbookが同じSCAPセキュリティガイドパッケージで提供されます。 例: Listing 1. bashスクリプト

spacecheck_free_alert = 10 spacecheck_free_critical = 5 デフォルトでは、クリティカルアラートしきい値に達すると、Uyuniはspacewalkサービスをシャットダウンします。 この動作は、spacecheck_shutdownパラメータで変更できます。 trueの値はシャットダウン機能を有効にします。 その他の値は無効にします。 例: spacecheck_shutdown = true スペースチェックツールはデフォルトで有効になっています。 次のコマンドを使用して完全に無効にできます。 systemctl stop spacewalk-diskcheck.timer systemctl disable spacewalk-diskcheck.timer spacewalk-diskcheck.timerを無効にすると、アラートのしきい値に達した場合に定期的な電子メールアラートが停止しますが、警告通知はサインインページの上部に表示されます。","title":"ディスク容量管理","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"space-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/space-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Use Case 2. Outcome 3. Preparation 4. Step-by-step Workflow Instructions 5. Related Topics Uyuni is all about managing client systems. So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients. This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see サポートされているクライアントと機能. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see 登録メソッド. Procedure: Configure a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on Your Client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.suma.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.suma.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare Software Channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Related Topics This workflow shows how to automate updating the clients registered at Uyuni using recurring actions. Automated update of clients is benefitial when: update of a large number of clients is wanted the workflow should not be re-done every execution a dedicated maintenance window exists. Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent and supportable state. Before you start, you should have a number of clients onboarded. It may make sense to have them sorted into groups you want to update together. In this workflow we use a system group named infra-services. To update a client two steps are required. A third step is optional but highly recommended to finalize the update process. Procedure 1: Creating a Recurring Action to Update Salt Itself As an example, we create the action to update Salt itself as a recurring action for all systems in the organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like update-salt. Select a schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:00 am . Assign the update-salt state by selecting the checkbox. Click Save Changes to save the action. You can edit the execution order of the states if needed. Click Confirm to confirm the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 2: Creating a Recurring Action to Apply All Available Updates to the Systems As an example we create the action to apply all updates as a recurring action for a system group called infra-services. In the Uyuni Web UI go to Systems System Groups and click on infra-services. Now go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like full-system-update. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:30 am . Keep enough time between this action and the update-salt action. The update-salt actions must be finished on all systems before this action should be executed. Assign the states util.syncall, certs, channels and uptodate by selecting the checkboxes. To perform a reboot afterwards you can also add reboot or rebootifneeded. Save the action by clicking Save Changes. You can edit the execution order of the states. The order should be util.syncall, certs, channels, uptodate and finally reboot or rebootifneeded if chosen. Click Confirm to store the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 4: Creating a Recurring Action to Run a Highstate After the Update As an example, we create the action to apply the highstate for the same group which was fully updated before. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click infra-services. Go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Highstate and enter a Schedule Name like highstate. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 10:30 am . Again, keep enough time between this action and the full-system-update action. Click Create Schedule to save the action.

Related Topics You can use configuration files and channels to manage configuration for your clients, rather than configuring each client manually. This workflow shows you how to use the Uyuni Web UI to create a centrally managed configuration file, assign it to a client, and apply the configuration. If you are managing a lot of clients, you probably do not want to manually apply configuration settings to each of them in turn. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a configuration channel containing a configuration file, have assigned clients to the channel, and applied the configuration successfully. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. At least one client registered to your server. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a centrally managed configuration file and a Salt state. You can also use locally managed configuration files and different methods, to get more flexibility in how you manage configuration in your environment. For more information about the different ways to manage configuration, see 設定管理. Procedure: Create a New Configuration Channel and file In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels and click Create State Channel.

Use Case 2. Outcome 3. Preparations 4. Step-by-step Workflow Instructions 5. Related Topics If you are managing a lot of clients and you need to apply customized packages to them, you can use content lifecycle management (CLM) to manage your packages. CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server deployed, and accessible using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. Procedure: Create a new CLM Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects section, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. Leave the Filters section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example. You can add filters later on if you need to. In the Environment Lifecycle section, create three environments: production, testing, and development. Click Add Environment and complete the name and label for each. For the production environment, leave the Insert before field blank. For the testing environment, in the Insert before field, select production. For the development environment, in the Insert before field, select testing. Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign Clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel -production-. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel -testing-. Click Next to assign the client. Procedure: Promote Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section.

Migration of Clients This workflow shows how to automatically complete the task of in-place SUSE Linux Enterprise Server instances upgrade with Uyuni Server. In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade true #if $channel_prefix != \"\" https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #else https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #end if $channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool sle-manager-tools Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration. Procedure: Migrating Clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process.

Step-by-step Instructions Uyuni offers various image formats, including a RAW format. This guide demonstrates how to set up Uyuni Server using the raw image. RAW images are pre-built, ready-to-use representations of a running operating system. Instead of being installed through a traditional installer, they are directly copied to the hard disk of the target host. RAW image format is flexible and compatible with a wide range of virtualization and deployment tools. This guide provides essential information about these pre-configured images. Successful completion of this workflow results in successful installation of Uyuni Server. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Prerequisites Download the Image: Download the architecture-specific .raw.xz image of Uyuni Server for your target block size. Make Image Accessible: Copy the image to a web server (preferred), or expand the .raw file to add directly as a disk in a virtual environment (if supported). Target Disk Setup: If applicable, in virtual machine hypervisor, create: A 40GB root disk Additional storage for persistent SUSE Manager data Procedure: Installation Steps Prepare Boot Environment and Network Provide a bootable ISO (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SPX or SLE Micro 5.5) to access the \"Rescue System.\" Add netsetup=1 on the kernel command line for networking, or configure IP via ifcfg. Create a new instance, attach the root and persistent storage, then attach the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or SLE Micro ISO as a virtual CD. Boot the instance to the ISO, selecting the Rescue System. Add the following on the command line to enable network configuration. netsetup=1 Configure Network and Identify Devices Complete network setup as prompted and log in as root. Use a disk storage utility like blockdev or lsblk to verify the block size against your downloaded image. blockdev --getpbsz $device lsblk -o NAME,PHY-SEC Transfer the Image Use curl to copy the .raw.xz image onto the root disk: curl -Sks $url | xz -d > $device -v Replace $url with the image URL and $device with the root partition device. Finalize Boot and Configuration Power off the instance, remove the virtual CD from the boot sequence, and start it again to boot from the newly created instance. Follow on-screen installation directions and, if needed, register with SUSE Customer Center, adding the SUSE Manager Server Extension. Install VMware Tools (if applicable) Install the open-vm-tools transactional-update pkg install open-vm-tools Reboot after installation. Provision Persistent Storage mgr-storage-server $device Ensure $device points to the fast, persistent storage. For more information, see Persistent Volumes.","title":"Installing Uyuni Using RAW Image","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-install-from-raw-image","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-install-from-raw-image.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

CobblerでRed Hat ISOイメージを構築する Uyuniにまだ登録されていないクライアントで、PXEを通じたネットワークブートを選択できない場合は、ブート可能なCD-ROMまたはUSBメモリを使用してシステムをインストールできます。 このようなリムーバブルメディアを作成する1つの方法は、Cobblerを使用することです。 Cobblerを使用してISOイメージを作成する方法については、CobblerでISOイメージを構築するを参照してください。 SUSEシステムでは、多くの場合、KIWIを使用してISOイメージを準備することが推奨されます。 詳細については、KIWIでSUSE ISOイメージを構築するを参照してください。 いずれの場合も、生成されたイメージをCD-ROMまたはUSBメモリに書き込みます。 Cobblerは、一連のディストリビューション、カーネル、およびメニューが含まれているISOブートイメージを作成できます。これはPXEインストールと同じように動作します。 CobblerによるISOの構築はIBM Zではサポートされていません。 CobblerでISOイメージを作成するには、PXEを通じてネットワークブートを使用する場合と同様に、ディストリビューションとプロファイルを作成する必要があります。ディストリビューションの作成については、自動インストールのディストリビューションを参照してください。プロファイルの作成については、自動インストールのプロファイルを参照してください。 The Cobbler buildiso command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO. Specifying the distribution with --distro is mandatory when running buildiso command. --iso is the output location: mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro= You must use distribution and profile labels as listed by Cobbler, and not simply as shown in the Web UI. To list the names of distributions and profiles stored by Cobbler, run the commands: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list mgrctl exec -- cobbler profile list The boot ISO includes all profiles and systems by default. You can limit which profiles and systems are used with the --profiles and --systems options: mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso --systems=\"system1 system2 system3\" \\ --profiles=\" \" \\ --distro= With --esp you can enable the built boot ISOs with Secure Boot. You explicitly specify the EFI System Partition (ESP). By default, Cobbler generates the ESP partition, which disables Secure Boot. mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso \\ --esp=\"/usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-15-SP6-x86_64/boot/x86_64/efi\" \\ --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro= Procedure: Finding efi On the container host, execute the following command to get the distro name: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list This command outputs strings such as sles15-sp6:1:SUSE. On the container host, execute the following command to get information about the distro files location: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro report --name sles15-sp6:1:SUSE This command outputs a report such as the following: Name : sles15-sp6:1:SUSE Architecture : x86_64 ...output omitted...

Kickstartプロファイルについては、Kickstartプロファイルを参照してください。 プロファイルに含まれる自動インストールファイルには、変数とコードスニペットを格納できます。 変数とコードスニペットについては、テンプレートの構文を参照してください。 自動インストールファイルとディストリビューションの準備ができたら、プロファイルを作成して、Uyuniサーバで自動インストールを管理できます。プロファイルにより、選択したこのディストリビューションのインストール方法が決定されます。プロファイルを作成する1つの方法はAutoYaSTファイルまたはKickstartファイルをアップロードする方法です。または、Kickstartのみの場合、Web UIウィザードを使用できます。 プロシージャ: アップロードによる自動インストールプロファイルの作成 UyuniのWeb UIで、システム 自動インストール プロファイルに移動します。 キックスタート/AutoYaSTファイルをアップロードをクリックします。 ［ラベル］フィールドにプロファイルの名前を入力します。 スペースは使用しません。 ［自動インストールツリー］フィールドで、このプロファイルに使用する自動インストールのディストリビューションを選択します。 ［仮想化タイプ］フィールドで、このプロファイルに使用する仮想化の種類を選択します。または、このプロファイルを使用して新しい仮想マシンを作成しない場合には［なし］を選択します。 自動インストールファイルの内容を［ファイルの内容］フィールドにコピーするか、または［アップロードするファイル］フィールドを使用してファイルを直接アップロードします。 ここに記載する詳細については、AutoYaSTプロファイルまたはKickstartプロファイルを参照してください。 作成をクリックしてプロファイルを作成します。 プロシージャ: ウィザードでKickstartプロファイルを作成する UyuniのWeb UIで、システム 自動インストール プロファイルに移動します。 キックスタートプロファイルを作成をクリックします。 ［ラベル］フィールドにプロファイルの名前を入力します。 スペースは使用しません。 ［ベースチャンネル］フィールドで、このプロファイルに使用するベースチャンネルを選択します。このフィールドは利用できるディストリビューションから入力されます。 必要なベースチャンネルが利用できない場合、ディストリビューションを正しく作成したことを確認してください。 ［仮想化タイプ］フィールドで、このプロファイルに使用する仮想化の種類を選択します。または、仮想化しない場合には［なし］を選択します。 次へをクリックします。 ［配信ファイルの場所］で、Uyuniサーバにインストールするインストールメディアへのパスを入力します。 次へをクリックします。 クライアントのrootユーザのパスワードを入力します。 完了をクリックします。 新しいプロファイルの詳細を確認し、必要に応じてカスタマイズします。 自動インストールプロファイルを作成している場合、［このベースチャンネルに最新のツリーを常に使用します］にチェックを付けることができます。 この設定では、指定ベースチャンネルに関連付けられた最新ディストリビューションをUyuniで自動選択できます。 新しいディストリビューションを後で追加する場合、Uyuniは、最後に作成または変更されたディストリビューションを使用します。 仮想化の種類を変更すると、通常、プロファイルのブートローダおよびパーティションオプションを変更する必要があります。 この操作を実行すると、カスタマイズが上書きされます。 新しい設定または変更した設定を保存前に確認します。そのためには、［パーティション設定］タブに移動します。 ディストリビューションとプロファイルのカーネルオプションは統合されます。 自動インストールプロファイルの詳細および設定を変更できます。そのためには、システム 自動インストール プロファイルに移動し、編集するプロファイルの名前をクリックします。 または、システム システム一覧に移動し、プロビジョニングするクライアントを選択し、プロビジョニング 自動インストールサブタブに移動します。 AutoYaSTプロファイルは、プロファイルを識別するラベル、自動インストールのディストリビューションをポイントする自動インストールツリー、さまざまなオプション、最も重要なAutoYaSTインストールファイルで構成されます。 AutoYaSTインストールファイルは、AutoYaSTインストーラに指示を与えるXMLファイルです。AutoYaSTでは、「制御ファイル」と呼ばれます。 AutoYaSTインストールファイルの構文の詳細については、https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#cha-configuration-installation-optionsを参照してください。 SUSEには、独自のカスタムファイルの雛形として使用できるAutoYaSTインストールファイルのテンプレートが用意されています。 このテンプレートは、https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profilesのAutoYastディレクトリにあります。 各プロファイルを使用するにはその前に、一部の変数を設定する必要があります。 スクリプトに含まれているREADMEファイルを確認して、必要な変数を判別してください。 AutoYaSTスクリプトで変数を使用する方法の詳細については、変数を参照してください。 UyuniでインストールするためのAutoYaSTインストールファイルで、最も重要なセクションを次に示します。 を使用すると、子チャンネルをインストールに追加できます。例については、https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#Software-Selections-additionalを参照してください。 $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_no_signature_checks')は、署名のチェックを無効にします。 によって、Unified Installerに製品を指定できます。 「」の例については、https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#CreateProfile-Softwareを参照してください。 $SNIPPET('spacewalk/minion_script ')は、クライアントをSaltクライアントとしてUyuniに登録できるようにします。 AutoYaSTの詳細については、https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/を参照してください。 AutoYaSTに代わるSaltベースの最近のプロファイルには、Yomiがあります。Yomiについては、Yomiを使用してインストールするを参照してください。 Kickstartプロファイルには、多数の設定オプションがあります。 プロファイルを作成するには、プロファイルをアップロードするか、専用のウィザードを使用します。 Kickstartプロファイルでは、ファイル保持一覧を使用できます。 Kickstartで再インストールするクライアントにあるカスタム設定ファイルが多数ある場合、リストにしてこれらのファイルを保存し、そのリストをKickstartプロファイルに関連付けることができます。 プロシージャ: ファイル保持一覧の作成 UyuniのWeb UIで、システム 自動インストール ファイル保持に移動し、ファイル保持一覧の作成をクリックします。 適切なラベルを入力し、保存するすべてのファイルおよびディレクトリへの絶対パスをリストします。 一覧の作成をクリックします。 Kickstartプロファイルにファイル保持一覧を含めます。 システム 自動インストール プロファイルに移動して編集するプロファイルを選択し、システムの詳細 ファイル保持サブタブに移動して、含めるファイル保持一覧を選択します。 ファイル保持一覧の合計サイズは1 MBに制限されています。 /dev/hda1や/dev/sda1などの特殊なデバイスは保持できません。 ファイル名とディレクトリ名のみ使用できます。正規表現のワイルドカードは使用できません。 Kickstartの詳細については、Red Hatのドキュメントを参照してください。 インストールファイルの一部は、インストール中に置き換えられます。 変数は単一の値に置き換えられ、コードスニペットはテキストのセクション全体に置き換えられます。 エスケープされた記号やセクションは置き換えられません。 CobblerはCheetahと呼ばれるテンプレートエンジンを使用して、このような置き換えを実行できます。このメカニズムにより、システムごとにプロファイルを手動で作成する必要なく、多数のシステムを再インストールできます。 自動インストールの変数やコードスニペットは、Uyuni Web UI内で作成できます。 プロファイル内の［自動インストールファイル］タブでは、置き換えの結果を確認できます。 変数については、変数を参照してください。 コードスニペットについては、コードスニペットを参照してください。 エスケープ記号またはテキストブロックについては、エスケープを参照してください。 自動インストールの変数は、KickstartプロファイルおよびAutoYaSTプロファイルに値を代入するために使用できます。 変数を定義するには、プロファイルから［変数］サブタブに移動し、テキストボックスでname=valueペアを作成します。 たとえば、クライアントのIPアドレスを格納する変数と、ゲートウェイのアドレスを格納する変数を作成できます。 次に、作成した変数は、同じプロファイルからインストールされるすべてのクライアントに対して定義できます。 このためには、［変数］テキストボックスに次の行を追加します。 ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 変数を使用するには、プロファイルで値の前に$記号を付けて値を代入します。 たとえば、Kickstartファイルの［ネットワーク］部分は次のようになることがあります。 network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway $ipaddrは192.168.0.28に解決され、$gatewayは192.168.0.1に解決されます。 インストールファイルでは、変数は階層的に使用します。 システム変数はプロファイル変数より優先され、プロファイル変数はディストリビューション変数より優先されます。 Uyuniには、多数の定義済みコードスニペットが付属しています。システム 自動インストール 自動インストールスニペットに移動し、既存のスニペットの一覧を表示します。 自動インストールファイルの$SNIPPET()マクロに挿入してスニペットを使用します。 たとえば、Kickstartでは次のようになります。 $SNIPPET('spacewalk/rhel_register_script') または、AutoYaSTでは次のようになります。 $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script') このマクロはCobblerによって解析され、スニペットの内容に置き換えられます。独自のコードスニペットを保存して、後で自動インストールファイルで使用することもできます。スニペットの作成をクリックして、新しいコードスニペットを作成します。 この例では、一般的なハードドライブのパーティション設定のKickstartスニペットが設定されます。 clearpart --all part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary part swap --recommended part pv.00 --size=1 --grow volgroup vg00 pv.00 logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000 たとえば、次のようにスニペットを使用します。 $SNIPPET('my_partition') 自動インストールファイルには、$(example)のようなシェルスクリプト変数が含まれています。コンテンツはバックスラッシュ(円記号)でエスケープする必要があります\\$(example)。 $記号をエスケープすると、テンプレートエンジンは記号を内部変数として評価しなくなります。 コードフラグメントやスクリプトなどのテキストブロックは、\\#rawディレクティブおよび\\#end rawディレクティブで囲むことによってエスケープできます。 次に例を示します。 #raw #!/bin/bash for i in {0..2}; do echo \"$i - Hello World!\" done #end raw #記号の後にスペースがある行はコメントとして扱われるため、評価されません。 次に例を示します。 # start some section (this is a

新しく作成された仮想マシンを自動的に登録するには、cloud-initを活用して登録することをお勧めします。 このソリューションでは、ホストへのSSH接続を設定する必要がありません。 また、クライアントの作成に使用するツールに関係なく使用することができます。 ユーザは、マシンをUyuniに自動的に登録するために、Terraformを使用してイメージを展開するときにユーザデータのセットを渡すことができます。 user_dataはブートストラップ時にマシンを初めて起動したときのみ1回だけ実行されます。 cloud-initを使用してクライアントを登録する前にユーザは以下を設定する必要があります。 ブートストラップスクリプト: 詳細については、Register Clients With a Bootstrap Scriptを参照してください。 アクティベーションキー: 詳細については、アクティベーションキーを参照してください。 次のコマンドを実行すると、ブートストラップスクリプトがダウンロードされ、新しいマシン作成時にそのマシンが登録されます。 これをcloud-init設定に追加する必要があります。 curl -s http://hub-server.tf.local/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-default.sh | bash -s user_dataが更新されてプロビジョニングが変更されると必ず、Terraformはそのマシンを破棄してから新しいIPなどを使用して再作成します。

cloud-initの例については、https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/cloudinit/latest/docs/data-sources/cloudinit_config#example-usageを参照してください。 新しく作成した仮想マシンの自動登録の2番目のソリューションではTerraformのremote-execプロビジョナーを使用します。 remote-execプロビジョナーは新しく作成されたマシンとやり取りします。 これは、SSH接続を開き、そのマシンでコマンドを実行できます。 リモート実行プロビジョナーを使用してクライアントを登録するとき、ユーザは、Terraformを実行しているマシンが、新しい仮想マシン作成後にそのマシンにアクセスできることを確認する必要があります。 その他の要件は、[cloud-initベースのクライアントの登録]と同じです。 ブートストラップスクリプト: 詳細については、Register Clients With a Bootstrap

デフォルトでは、既存のリポジトリは、最新パッケージでのみ更新されます。 代わりに、必ず空のリポジトリで始まるように設定できます。 この動作を有効にするには、/etc/rhn/rhn.confで次の値を追加または編集します。 server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_flush = 1 自動モード デフォルトでは、ブートストラップリポジトリの自動再生成は有効になっています。 無効にするには、/etc/rhn/rhn.confで次の値を追加または編集します。 server.susemanager.auto_generate_bootstrap_repo = 0 このツールは、各ディストリビューションに必要なパッケージに関する情報を含むデータファイルを使用します。 データファイルは/usr/share/susemanager/mgr_bootstrap_data.pyに保存されています。 SUSEはこのファイルを定期的に更新します。 このファイルを変更する場合、直接編集しないでください。 代わりに、同じディレクトリにコピーを作成し、コピーを編集します。 cd /usr/share/susemanager/ cp mgr_bootstrap_data.py my_data.py 変更したら、Uyuniを設定して新しいファイルを使用します。 /etc/rhn/rhn.confでこの値を追加または編集します。 server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_datamodule = my_data 次の更新時、SUSEの新しいデータによって、新しいデータファイルではなく元のデータファイルが上書きされます。 SUSEによって行われた変更を使用して新しいファイルを最新に保つ必要があります。 デフォルトでは、ブートストラップリポジトリは毎日再生成されます。 コマンドプロンプトからブートストラップリポジトリを手動で作成できます。 プロシージャ: SUSE Linux Enterpriseのブートストラップリポジトリの生成 Uyuniサーバのコマンドプロンプトで、rootとして、次のコマンド用のブートストラップリポジトリを作成するために使用できるディストリビューションをリストします。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l 製品ラベルとして適切なリポジトリ名を使用して、ブートストラップリポジトリを作成します。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64 または、利用可能なディストリビューション一覧のディストリビューション名の横に表示されている番号を使用します。 クライアントリポジトリは/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/にあります。 複数の製品(SLESとSLES for SAPなど)をミラーリング済みの場合、またはカスタムチャンネルを使用している場合、ブートストラップリポジトリを作成するときに使用する親チャンネルを指定する必要が生じる場合があります。 これは、あらゆる状況で必須ではありません。 たとえば、SLES 15の一部のバージョンには共通のコードベースがあるため、親チャンネルを指定する必要はありません。 このプロシージャは、ご使用の環境で必要な場合のみ使用します。 オプションのプロシージャ: ブートストラップリポジトリの親チャンネルの指定 利用できる親チャンネルを確認します。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 Multiple options for parent channel

複数の異なるアーキテクチャを含むブートストラップリポジトリを作成している場合、すべてのアーキテクチャが正しく更新されることに注意を払う必要があります。 たとえば、SLEのx86-64アーキテクチャおよびIBM Zアーキテクチャは、同じブートストラップリポジトリURL(/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/sle/15/2/bootstrap/)を使用します。 フラッシュオプションを有効にすると、複数のアーキテクチャのブートストラップリポジトリを生成しようとしても、生成されるアーキテクチャは1つのみです。 この動作を回避するには、追加のアーキテクチャを作成するとき、コマンドプロンプトで--no-flushオプションを使用します。 次に例を示します。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-SP2-x86_64 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --no-flush -c SLE-15-SP2-s390x カスタムチャンネルを使用している場合、mgr-create-bootstrap-repoコマンドを使用して--with-custom-channelsオプションを使用できます。 この場合、使用する親チャンネルも指定する必要があります。 カスタムチャンネルを使用すると、ブートストラップリポジトリの自動作成が失敗する場合があります。 この場合、リポジトリを手動で作成する必要があります。

SUSE Linux EnterpriseクライアントのUnified Installer更新チャンネル チャンネルは、ソフトウェアパッケージをグループ化する方法です。 ソフトウェアパッケージはリポジトリによって提供され、リポジトリはチャンネルに関連付けられています。 クライアントをソフトウェアチャンネルにサブスクライブすると、クライアントは、これに関連付けられたソフトウェアをインストールし、更新できます。 Uyuniでは、チャンネルはベースチャンネルと子チャンネルに分割されます。 この方法でチャンネルを編成すると、互換性のあるパッケージのみが各システムにインストールされるようになります。 クライアントは、1つのベースチャンネルのみをサブスクライブして、登録中にクライアントのオペレーティングシステムおよびアーキテクチャに基づいて割り当てる必要があります。 ベンダによって提供される有料チャンネルでは、関連付けされたサブスクリプションを持っている必要があります。 ベースチャンネルは、特定のオペレーティングシステムの種類、バージョン、およびアーキテクチャのために構築されたパッケージから構成されています。 たとえば、SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86-64のベースチャンネルには、そのオペレーティングシステムおよびアーキテクチャと互換性のあるソフトウェアのみが含まれています。 子チャンネルはベースチャンネルに関連付けられていて、ベースチャンネルと互換性のあるパッケージのみを提供します。 システムは、ベースチャンネルの複数の子チャンネルにサブスクライブできます。 システムがベースチャンネルに割り当てられている場合、そのシステムは関連する子チャンネルをインストールできます。 たとえば、システムがSUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86_64 ベースチャンネルに割り当てられている場合、互換性のあるベースチャンネルまたは関連する子チャンネルのいずれかから利用できるパッケージのみインストールまたは更新できます。 UyuniのWeb UIで、ソフトウェア チャンネル一覧 すべてに移動して、利用できるチャンネルをブラウズできます。 ソフトウェア 管理 チャンネルに移動して、チャンネルを変更または新しいチャンネルを作成できます。 カスタムチャンネルなどチャンネルを使用する方法の詳細については、チャンネル管理を参照してください。 Handling the Installer Updates Channel after Bootstrapping Once a client system has been bootstrapped, the Installer Updates channel should be removed. The standard update channel already includes the necessary updates, making this channel redundant. Additionally, during migrations, this channel is unnecessary and should not be used. SUSE Package HubはSUSE Linux Enterprise製品の拡張機能で、openSUSEコミュニティで提供する追加オープンソースソフトウェアを提供しています。 SUSE Package Hubのパッケージは、openSUSEコミュニティによって提供されます。 パッケージはSUSEではサポートされていません。 クライアントでSUSE Linux Enterpriseオペレーティングシステムを使用している場合、SUSE Package Hub拡張機能を有効にして、これらの追加パッケージにアクセスできます。 アクセスすると、クライアントのサブスクライブ先にできるSUSE Package Hubチャンネルが提供されます。 SUSE Package Hubは多数のパッケージを提供しており、大量のディスク容量を使用してパッケージの同期に長時間かかる場合があります。 提供するパッケージが必要でない場合、SUSE Package Hubを有効にしないでください。 サポートされていないパッケージを誤ってインストールまたは更新しないためには、最初にすべてのSUSE Package Hubパッケージを拒否するコンテンツライフサイクル管理戦略の実装をお勧めします。 その後、必要なパッケージを明示的に有効にできます。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理の詳細については、コンテンツライフサイクル管理を参照してください。 Red Hatベースのクライアントの場合、AppStreamから追加パッケージを利用できます。 ほとんどの場合、AppStreamパッケージでは、必要なソフトウェアをすべて持っていることを確認する必要があります。 Red Hatベースのクライアントの場合、EPEL(エンタープライズ版Linux用の追加パッケージ)から追加パッケージを利用できます EPELはオプションのパッケージリポジトリで、追加ソフトウェアが提供されます。 EPELのパッケージは、Fedoraコミュニティによって提供されます。 このパッケージはSUSEではサポートされていません。 クライアントでRed Hatオペレーティングシステムを使用している場合、EPEL拡張機能を有効にして、これらの追加パッケージにアクセスできます。 アクセスすると、クライアントのサブスクライブ先にできるEPELチャンネルが提供されます。 EPELは多数のパッケージを提供しており、大量のディスク容量を使用してパッケージの同期に長時間かかる場合があります。 提供するパッケージが必要でない場合、EPELリポジトリを有効にしないでください。 サポートされていないパッケージを誤ってインストールまたは更新しないためには、最初にすべてのEPELパッケージを拒否するコンテンツライフサイクル管理(CLM)戦略の実装をお勧めします。 その後、必要なパッケージを明示的に有効にできます。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理の詳細については、コンテンツライフサイクル管理を参照してください。 このチャンネルは、オペレーティングシステムをインストールする前に、Unified Installerが最新であることを確認するためにUnified Installerで使用されます。 すべてのSUSE Linux Enterprise製品は、インストール中にインストーラ更新チャンネルにアクセスできる必要があります。 SUSE Linux Enterprise Serverクライアントでは、更新を含む製品を追加するときにデフォルトでインストーラ更新チャンネルが同期します。また、これらの製品チャンネルで自動インストールディストリビューションを作成するときに有効になります。 SUSE Linux Enterprise for SAPなどその他すべてのSUSE Linux Enterpriseの亜種では、インストーラ更新チャンネルを手動で追加する必要があります。 そのためには、適切なSUSE Linux Enterprise Serverインストーラ更新チャンネルをこれらのSUSE Linux Enterprise亜種のベースチャンネルの下に複製します。 チャンネルを複製した後にこれらのSUSE Linux Enterprise亜種の自動インストールディストリビューションを作成するとき、そのインストーラ更新チャンネルが自動的に使用されます。","title":"ソフトウェアチャンネル","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"channels","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Then run the bootstrap script from the client. Procedure: Adding Install-created User to sudo Group and Bootstrapping via SSH On the client, as root, run from the command line (replace with the name of the install-created user): sudo usermod -aG sudo Bootstrap the client system from its command line (replace with the fully qualified domain name of the Uyuni Server): sudo su - curl -Sks https:///pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-script.sh | /bin/bash Ubuntu can only be bootstrapped using the corresponding Ubuntu bootstrap script run from the client system’s command line after issuing sudo su - as above. It cannot be bootstrapped via the Uyuni Web UI due to the fact that the root user is disabled on Ubuntu by default, and that the Web UI does not permit for privilege escalation of the Ubuntu install-created user. クライアントを登録するには、ブートストラップリポジトリが必要です。 デフォルトでは、ブートストラップリポジトリは自動的に作成され、すべての同期製品に対して毎日再生成されます。 次のコマンドを使用して、コマンドプロンプトからブートストラップリポジトリを手動で作成できます。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo クライアントの登録については、クライアントの登録を参照してください。","title":"Ubuntu 20.04、22.04、および24.04クライアントの登録","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-ubuntu","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-ubuntu.html","titles":[{"text":"1. ソフトウェアチャンネルの追加","hash":"_ソフトウェアチャンネルの追加","id":1},{"text":"2.

Using the Salt Bundle, it is no longer needed that the client provides any Python interpreter or modules. 新しいクライアントをブートストラップする場合、Salt Bundleを使用した登録がデフォルトの方法です。 既存のクライアントをSalt Bundleの方式に切り替えることができます。 切り替える場合、salt-minionパッケージおよびその依存関係はインストールされたままになります。 Salt Bundleは、Uyuniサーバ以外のSalt Masterによって管理されているSalt Minionと同時に使用できます。Salt Bundleが、UyuniサーバがSalt Bundleの設定ファイルを管理するクライアントにインストールされる場合、salt-minionの設定ファイルは管理されません。詳細については、Salt Bundleの設定を参照してください。 Uyuniサーバ以外のSalt Masterによって管理されているSalt Minionを使用してクライアントをブートストラップするには、ブートストラップスクリプトを生成するときにmgr-bootstrap --force-bundleを使用するか、またはブートストラップスクリプトでFORCE_VENV_SALT_MINIONを1に設定することをお勧めします。 Web UI mgr_force_venv_salt_minionをtrueに設定してブートストラップする場合、pillarをグローバルに指定できます。 詳細については、Salt States and Pillarsを参照してください。 salt-minionからvenv-salt-minionに切り替えるためにSalt状態util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minionを使用できます。移行プロセスのトラブルを回避するために、venv-salt-minionへの切り替えは2ステップで実行することをお勧めします。 Procedure: SwitchingWwith util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion State to venv-salt-minion まず、pillarを指定せずにutil.mgr_switch_to_venv_minionを適用します。 venv-salt-minionに切り替わり、設定ファイルなどがコピーされます。 元のsalt-minionの設定およびそのパッケージはクリーンアップされません。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minionを適用し、mgr_purge_non_venv_saltをTrueに設定してsalt-minionを削除し、mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_filesをTrueに設定してsalt-minionに関するすべてのファイルを削除します。 この2番目の手順によって、最初の手順が処理されたことが保証され、古い設定ファイルおよび古くなったsalt-minionパッケージが削除されます。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' In case of running the second step only and the first step, state apply process could fail as it requires stopping the salt-minion which is used to execute the command on the client side. It is also possible to avoid installing the Salt Bundle and keep using salt-minion instead. In this case, specify one of these options: --no-bundleオプションを指定してmgr-bootstrapを実行します。 生成されたブートストラップスクリプトでAVOID_VENV_SALT_MINIONを1に設定します。 ブートストラップ状態の場合、mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillarをTrueに設定します。 Salt Bundleは、クライアントに対してSSH Pushアクションを実行するときにも使用されます。 シェルスクリプトは、Saltコマンドを実行する前にvenv-salt-minionをインストールせずにSalt Bundleをターゲットシステムに配備します。Salt BundleにはSaltのコードベース全体が含まれているため、salt-thinは配備されません。SSH Push (Web UIを使用するブートストラップを含む)は、バンドル内でPython 3インタープリターを使用します。ターゲットシステムには他のPythonインタープリターがインストールされている必要はありません。 Bundleを使用して配備されたPython 3は、クライアントでSSH Pushセッションを処理するために使用されるため、SSH Push (Web UIを使用したブートストラップを含む)は、システムにインストールされているPythonに依存しません。 salt-thinの使用はフォールバック方法として有効にできますが、クライアントにPython 3をインストールする必要があります。この方法は、推奨もサポートもされておらず、開発目的でのみ存在しています。/etc/rhn/rhn.conf設定ファイルでweb.ssh_use_salt_thinをtrueに設定します。 ブートストラップリポジトリは、Web UIを使用してクライアントをブートストラップする前に作成済みである必要があります。SSH Pushは、検出したターゲットオペレーティングシステムに基づいてブートストラップリポジトリから取得されたSalt Bundleを使用しています。詳細については、client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repositoryを参照してください。 SSH Pushは、/var/tmpを使用して、Salt Bundleを配備し、バンドルされたPythonを使用してクライアント上でSaltコマンドを実行しています。したがって、noexecオプションを指定して/var/tmpをマウントしないでください。ブートストラッププロセスがクライアントに到達するためにSSH Pushを使用しているため、/var/tmpがnoexecオプションでマウントされたクライアントをWeb UIでブートストラップすることはできません。 Salt Bundleにはpipが含まれており、バンドルされているSalt Minionの機能を追加のPythonパッケージで拡張できます。 デフォルトで、salt pip.install は、で指定されたPythonパッケージを/var/lib/venv-salt-minion/localにインストールします。 必要に応じて、venv-salt-minion.serviceの環境変数VENV_PIP_TARGETを設定することで、パス/var/lib/venv-salt-minion/localを上書きできます。 サービスにはsystemdのドロップイン設定ファイルを使用することをお勧めします。 設定ファイル/etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.confで実行できます。 [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip pipを使用してインストールしたPythonパッケージは、Salt Bundleの更新時に変更されません。更新後にこのようなパッケージが使用可能で機能するようにするために、Salt Bundleの更新後に適用されるSaltの状態でパッケージをインストールすることをお勧めします。","title":"Salt Bundle","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Such a scenario might not work everywhere. Therefore also SSH Push (with tunnel) is available as contact method. That also opens a reverse tunnel and thus you can communicate through all firewalls which otherwise might block the connection from client to server. SSH Pushは、デーモンエージェントをクライアントにインストールできない場合にも使用されます。 SSH Pushメソッドには重大な制限があります。SSH Pushは適切にスケールせず、標準のSaltメソッド(default)よりも多くのサーバリソースとネットワーク帯域幅を消費します。Push SSHメソッドは、大規模なセットアップ(1000クライアント以上)では一切サポートされません。 サーバは、SSH Pushを使用して、定期的にクライアントに接続し、チェックインし、スケジュールされたアクションおよびイベントを実行します。 プロビジョニングモデルを使用したシステムの再インストールは、SSH Pushで管理されているクライアントでは現在サポートされていません。 次のイメージは、SSH Pushプロセスのパスを示しています。Taskomaticブロックの左側のアイテムはすべて、Uyuniクライアントで実行されるプロセスを表します。 SSH Pushを使用するには、SSHデーモンがクライアントで動作していて、Uyuniサーバで動作しているsalt-apiデーモンによって接続できる必要があります。また、必須のPythonバージョンをSalt Bundleとともにクライアントシステムに配備する必要があります。 次の登録手順を開始する前に、SSH Push接続メソッドが設定された状態でアクティベーションキーを定義します。このメソッドでは、HTTPSでのサーバとの直接接続が存在する必要があります。 Web UIまたはAPIを使用して、これらのクライアントをUyuniサーバに登録する必要があります。次のプロシージャまたは例を参照してください。 Procedure: Registering Clients With SSH Push UyuniのWeb UIで、システム ブートストラップに移動し、該当するフィールドに入力します。 SSH Push接続メソッドが設定された状態でアクティベーションキーを選択します。アクティベーションキーの詳細については、アクティベーションキーを参照してください。 ［Manage System Completely via SSH］（SSHでシステムを完全に管理する）チェックボックスにチェックを付けます。 ブートストラップをクリックして、登録を開始します。 システム 概要に移動して、システムが正しく登録されたことを確認します。 例: SSHでのプッシュへのAPIアクセス APIを使用して、使用する接続メソッドを管理できます。 このPythonコードの例では、接続メソッドがssh-pushに設定されます。 有効な値は次のとおりです。 default (pull) ssh-push ssh-push-tunnel client = xmlrpclib.Server(SUMA_HOST + \"/rpc/api\", verbose=0) key = client.auth.login(SUMA_LOGIN, SUMA_PASSWORD) client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'}) SSH Pushを設定している場合、ホスト、アクティベーションキー、パスワードなど、システムを登録するときに使用するパラメータを変更できます。このパスワードはブートストラップでのみ使用し、どこにも保存されません。今後のSSHセッションではすべて、キー/証明書のペアで認可されます。これらのパラメータはシステム ブートストラップで設定されます。 rootとしてではなく非特権ユーザとしてシステムにアクセスするためのsudoユーザなど、システム全体で使用される永続パラメータを設定することもできます。 Use mgrctl term before running steps inside the server container. プロシージャ: 非特権SSHアクセスの設定 最新のspacewalk-taskomaticパッケージおよびspacewalk-certs-toolsパッケージがUyuniサーバにインストールされていることを確認してください。 それぞれのクライアントシステムで、適切な非特権ユーザを作成します。 各クライアントシステムで、sudoersファイルを編集します。 sudo visudo この行をsudoersファイルの末尾に追加してsudoアクセス権をユーザに付与します。 Web UIでクライアントをブートストラップしているユーザの名前でを置き換えます。 ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python このプロシージャによりrootアクセス権が付与されます。クライアントの登録に必要なパスワードは不要です。 クライアントは正常にインストールされると、root特権で実行されるため、アクセス権は不要です。 クライアントを正しくインストールした後、sudoersファイルからこの行を削除することをお勧めします。 Inside the Uyuni Server container, edit the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file, and add or amend this line to include the unprivileged username: ssh_push_sudo_user = After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service.

By default, Uyuni unlinks such a package from the channel, but does not remove the package. リポジトリはパッケージを新しいバージョンに置き換えるので、以前のバージョンは削除されます。 reposyncプロセスが中断されたので(たとえば、容量不足の例外が発生したため)、ダウンロードされたパッケージがチャンネルに関連付けられませんでした。 ユーザはパッケージを手動でアップロードしましたが、どのチャンネルにも関連付けませんでした。 孤立したパッケージはユーザ環境で容量を消費し、チャンネルに関連付けられていないためクライアントに簡単に配布できません。 孤立したパッケージは、ブートストラップや顧客固有の手順のような特定のワークフローでは意味を持つ場合があります。 You can view orphaned packages in the Web UI by clicking Software Manage Packages view Packages in no channel. Uyuni periodically runs a taskomatic job that searches for orphaned packages and modifies the package organization ID to 1.

Introduction 2. mgr-bootstrapでのブートストラップスクリプトの作成 3. Web UIでのブートストラップスクリプトの作成 4. ブートストラップスクリプトの編集 5. ブートストラップスクリプトを実行してクライアントを登録する ブートストラップスクリプトでクライアントを登録すると、パラメータを制御できるようになり、同時に多数のクライアントを登録する必要がある場合に役立ちます。 ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録するには、まずブートストラップスクリプトのテンプレートを作成することをお勧めします。このテンプレートはその後コピーして変更できます。作成したブートストラップスクリプトは、登録時にクライアントで実行され、必要なパッケージがすべてクライアントに展開されていることを確認します。ブートストラップスクリプトに含まれている一部のパラメータによって、クライアントシステムを、アクティベーションキーやGPGキーを使用してそのベースチャンネルに割り当てることができるようになります。 リポジトリ情報を注意深く確認して、ベースチャンネルリポジトリと一致していることを確認することが重要です。 リポジトリ情報が正確に一致しないと、ブートストラップスクリプトは正しいパッケージをダウンロードできません。 Additional considerations: All clients need a bootstrap repository. It is automatically created and regenerated on the Uyuni Server when products are synchronized. A bootstrap repository includes packages for installing Salt on clients, and for registering clients. For more information about creating a bootstrap repository, see ブートストラップリポジトリ. デフォルトではopenSUSE Leap 15およびSLE 15はPython 3を使用します。Python 2に基づくブートストラップスクリプトは、openSUSE Leap 15システムおよびSLE 15システム用に再作成する必要があります。Python 2を使用してopenSUSE Leap 15システムまたはSLE 15システムを登録する場合、ブートストラップスクリプトは失敗します。 GPGキーおよびUyuniクライアントツール Uyuniクライアントツールで使用されるGPGキーは、デフォルトでは信頼されていません。 ブートストラップスクリプトを作成するとき、ORG_GPG_KEYパラメータを使用して公開鍵の指紋を含むファイルへのパスを追加します。 mgr-bootstrapコマンドは、カスタムブートストラップスクリプトを生成します。 ブートストラップスクリプトは、Uyuniクライアントシステムによって初期登録と設定を簡素化するために使用されます。 引数--activation-keysおよび--scriptは唯一の必須の引数です。Uyuniサーバでは、コマンドラインでrootとして、必須の引数を指定してコマンドを実行します。およびは使用する値に置き換えます。 mgr-bootstrap --activation-keys= --script=bootstrap-.sh mgr-bootstrapコマンドには、ほかにもオプションがいくつかあり、特定のホスト名を設定したり、特定のGPGキーを設定したり、登録方法(salt-minionまたはsalt-bundle)を設定したりできます。 詳細については、mgr-bootstrapのマニュアルページを参照するか、mgr-bootstrap --helpを実行してください。 UyuniのWeb UIを使用して、編集できるブートストラップスクリプトを作成できます。 プロシージャ: ブートストラップスクリプトの作成 UyuniのWeb UIで、管理 マネージャ設定 ブートストラップスクリプトに移動します。 必須フィールドには、前のインストール手順から取り出した値が事前に入力されています。 各設定の詳細については、ブートストラップスクリプトを参照してください。 更新をクリックしてスクリプトを作成します。 ブートストラップスクリプトが生成され、サーバの/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrapディレクトリに保存されます。 または、HTTPS経由でブートストラップスクリプトにアクセスできます。 をUyuniサーバのホスト名に置き換えます。 https:///pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh ブートストラップスクリプトのSSLを無効にしないでください。 Web UIで［Enable SSL］（SSLの有効化）がチェックされていること、または設定 USING_SSL=1 がブートストラップスクリプトに存在していることを確認してください。 SSLを無効にすると、登録プロセスでカスタムSSL証明書が必要です。 カスタム証明書の詳細については、see SSL証明書を参照してください。 作成したブートストラップスクリプトのテンプレートをコピーして変更し、カスタマイズできます。 Uyuniで使用するためにブートストラップスクリプトを編集するときの最小要件は、アクティベーションキーを含めることです。 ほとんどのパッケージはGPGで署名されているため、信頼できるGPGキーをシステムで用意してインストールすることも必要です。 このプロシージャでは、アクティベーションキーの正確な名前を知っている必要があります。 ホーム 概要に移動し、［タスク］ボックスで、［アクティベーションキーの管理］をクリックします。 チャンネル用に作成したすべてのキーがこのページに一覧表示されます。 ブートストラップスクリプトで使用するキーのフルネームを、キーフィールドに表示されているように正確に入力する必要があります。 アクティベーションキーの詳細については、アクティベーションキーを参照してください。 プロシージャ: ブートストラップスクリプトの変更 Uyuniサーバのコマンドラインでrootとして、ブートストラップディレクトリを次のように変更します。 cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ 各クライアントで使用するブートストラップスクリプトのテンプレートのコピーを2つ作成し、名前を変更します。 cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles12.sh cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles15.sh 変更するためにbootstrap-sles15.shを開きます。 次のテキストが表示されるまで下方にスクロールします。 ファイルに「exit 1」がある場合、その行の先頭にハッシュまたはポンド記号(#)を入力してコメントアウトします。 これによって、スクリプトがアクティブになります。 ACTIVATION_KEYS=フィールドにこのスクリプトのキーの名前を入力します。 echo \"Enable this script: comment (with #'s) this block (or, at least just\" echo \"the exit below)\" echo #exit 1 # can be edited, but probably correct (unless created during initial install): # NOTE: ACTIVATION_KEYS *must* be used to bootstrap a client machine. ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-sles15 ORG_GPG_KEY= 完了したら、ファイルを保存し、2つ目のブートストラップスクリプトでこの手順を繰り返します。 デフォルトでは、ブートストラップスクリプトは、venv-salt-minionがブートストラップリポジトリにある場合にはこれをインストールしようとし、ブートストラップリポジトリにSalt Bundleがない場合にはsalt-minionをインストールしようとします。何らかの理由でsalt-minionが必要な場合、Salt Bundleをインストールせずにsalt-minionの使用を続けることができます。 詳細については、Salt Bundleを参照してください。 スクリプトの作成を完了したら、このスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録できます。 プロシージャ: ブートストラップスクリプトの実行 Uyuniサーバにrootとしてログインし、コマンドプロンプトでブートストラップディレクトリを次のように変更します。 cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ 次のコマンドを実行して、クライアントでブートストラップスクリプトを実行します。 EXAMPLE.COMをクライアントのホスト名に置き換えます。 cat bootstrap-sles15.sh | ssh root@EXAMPLE.COM /bin/bash または、クライアントで次のコマンドを実行します。 curl -Sks https://server_hostname/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-sles15.sh | /bin/bash 問題を回避するには、ブートストラップスクリプトが bashを使用して実行されていることを確認してください。 このスクリプトは、前に作成したリポジトリディレクトリにある必要な依存関係をダウンロードします。 スクリプトの実行が完了すると、クライアントが正しく登録されたかどうかを確認できます。UyuniのWeb UIを開き、システム 概要に移動して、新しいクライアントがリストされていることを確認します。クライアントがリストされていない場合は、UyuniのWeb UIでSalt キーに移動して、クライアントキーが受け入れられているかどうかを確認します。 Uyuniを使用してクライアントに新しいパッケージまたは更新がインストールされると、エンドユーザライセンスアグリーメント(EULA)が自動的に受け入れられます。 パッケージのEULAを確認するには、Web UIでパッケージ詳細ページを開きます。","title":"Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-bootstrap","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Introduction 2. Salt Bundleの設定 3. クライアントの設定 Salt clients are registered accurately with the default bootstrap methods in most cases. However, you can use Salt to register the client to the Uyuni Server manually by editing the Salt minion file on the client, and providing the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the server. This method: uses ports 4505 and 4506 inbound to the server. requires no configuration on the Uyuni Server aside from ensuring that these ports are open. requires that you have installed the venv-salt-minion (Salt bundle) or the salt-minion package on the Salt client before registration. Both use configuration files in different locations and filenames remain the same. The systemd service filename is different. この方法でブートストラップを実行できるのは、クライアントツールチャンネルまたは公式のSUSEディストリビューションの一部としてsalt-minionを使用する場合のみです。 Salt Bundle (venv-salt-minion) /etc/venv-salt-minion/ /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/NAME.conf systemdサービスファイル: venv-salt-minion.service Salt bundleの詳細については、Salt Bundleを参照してください。 プロシージャ: Salt Bundle設定ファイルでクライアントを登録する Saltクライアントでminion設定ファイルを開きます。 設定ファイルは次の場所にあります。 /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion または /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/NAME.conf ファイルで、UyuniサーバまたはプロキシのFQDNと、アクティベーションキー(存在する場合)を追加または編集します。以下にリストされている他の設定パラメータも追加します。 マスタ: SERVER.EXAMPLE.COM grains: susemanager: activation_key: \"\" server_id_use_crc: adler32 enable_legacy_startup_events: False enable_fqdns_grains: False venv-salt-minionサービスを再起動します。 systemctl restart venv-salt-minion Uyuniサーバで、新しいクライアントキーを受け入れます。をクライアントの名前に置き換えます。 salt-key -a '' クライアント(salt-minion) /etc/salt/ /etc/salt/minion /etc/salt/minion.d/NAME.conf systemdサービスファイル: salt-minion.service プロシージャ: Salt Minion設定ファイルでクライアントを登録する Saltクライアントでminion設定ファイルを開きます。 設定ファイルは次の場所にあります。 /etc/salt/minion または /etc/salt/minion.d/NAME.conf ファイルで、UyuniサーバまたはプロキシのFQDNと、アクティベーションキー(存在する場合)を追加または編集します。以下にリストされている他の設定パラメータも追加します。 マスタ: SERVER.EXAMPLE.COM grains: susemanager: activation_key: \"\" server_id_use_crc: adler32 enable_legacy_startup_events: False enable_fqdns_grains: False salt-minionサービスを再起動します。 systemctl restart salt-minion Uyuniサーバで、新しいクライアントキーを受け入れます。をクライアントの名前に置き換えます。 salt-key -a '' For more information about the Salt minion configuration file, see Salt Project Documentation: Minion Configuration.","title":"コマンドラインでクライアントを登録する","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-cli","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-cli.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Introduction 2. Register Clients With the Web UI 3. ローカルで割り当てられたリポジトリの取り扱い Bootstrapping clients with the Web UI is using Salt SSH to execute the bootstrap process on the client. Salt SSH uses the Salt Bundle with the Python interpreter included. Therefore, no other Python interpreter needs to be installed on the client. Salt Bundle is made available together with the bootstrap repository. Therefore the bootstrap repository must be created before starting the bootstrap process for the client. A shell script detects the operating system on the client and deploys the Salt Bundle from the appropriate bootstrap repository, using the same logic as the bootstrap script. For more information, see Prepare to Create a Bootstrap Repository. Uyuniサーバをこのサーバ自体に登録しないでください。Uyuniサーバは個別に管理するか、別のUyuniサーバを使用して管理する必要があります。複数のサーバを使用する方法の詳細については、Multiple Servers with Hub to Manage Large Scale Deploymentsを参照してください。 Procedure: Registering Clients With the Web UI UyuniのWeb UIで、システム ブートストラップに移動します。 ［ホスト］フィールドに、ブートストラップするクライアントの完全修飾ドメイン名(FQDN)を入力します。 ［SSHポート］フィールドに、クライアントを接続してブートストラップするために使用するSSHポート番号を入力します。 デフォルトでは、SSHポートは22です。 ［ユーザ］フィールドに、クライアントにログインするユーザ名を入力します。 デフォルトでは、ユーザ名はrootです。 Select an Authentication method: To bootstrap the client with an SSH key, in the Authentication field, check SSH Private Key, and upload the SSH private key to use to log in to the client. SSH秘密鍵でパスフレーズが必要な場合、［SSH機密鍵のパスフレーズ］フィールドに入力します。パスフレーズがない場合には空白のままにします。 パスワードでクライアントをブートストラップするには、［認証］フィールドで、［パスワード］にチェックを付け、クライアントへのログインに使用するパスワードを入力します。 ［アクティベーションキー］フィールドで、クライアントのブートストラップに使用するソフトウェアチャンネルに関連付けられているアクティベーションキーを選択します。 詳細については、アクティベーションキーを参照してください。 オプション: ［プロキシ］フィールドで、クライアントの登録先にするプロキシを選択します。 デフォルトでは、［Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking］（SSH厳密キーホストの確認を無効にする）チェックボックスにチェックが付いています。 このチェックボックスにチェックが付いていると、ブートストラッププロセスは、手動認証なしでSSHホストキーを自動的に受け入れます。 オプション: ［Manage System Completely via SSH］（SSHでシステムを完全に管理する）チェックボックスにチェックを付けます。 If you check this option, the client is configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other contact method is configured. For more information about contact methods, see クライアントの接続メソッド. ブートストラップをクリックして、登録を開始します。 ブートストラッププロセスが完了したら、クライアントは［システム システム一覧］にリストされます。 SSH秘密鍵は、ブートストラッププロセス中のみ保存されます。 秘密鍵は、ブートストラップが完了するとすぐにUyuniサーバから削除されます。 Uyuniを使用してクライアントに新しいパッケージまたは更新がインストールされると、エンドユーザライセンスアグリーメント(EULA)が自動的に受け入れられます。 パッケージのEULAを確認するには、Web UIでパッケージ詳細ページを開きます。 Uyuniがサービスを提供しないクライアントにリポジトリを直接割り当てることは、一般的なユースケースではありません。 問題の原因になる可能性があります。 したがって、Saltを介してブートストラップすることで、ブートストラッププロセスの開始時にすべてのローカルリポジトリを無効にします。 その後、Highstateやパッケージのインストールを実行するなど、チャンネルの状態を使用するたびに、ローカルに割り当てられたすべてのリポジトリが再び無効になります。 クライアントで使用されるすべてのソフトウェアパッケージは、Uyuniがサービスを提供するチャンネルから取得される必要があります。 カスタムチャンネルの作成の詳細については、カスタムチャンネルのカスタムチャンネルを参照してください。","title":"Register Clients With the Web UI","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-webui","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-webui.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The goal of this connection is to extract authentication data so the Uyuni Server can connect to a cloud RMT host. Then the Uyuni Server has access to products on the RMT host that are not already available with the SUSE Customer Center organization credentials. PAYG機能を使用する前に、以下のことを確認してください。 PAYGインスタンスが正しいSUSE製品イメージ(例: SLES、SLES for SAP、SLE HPC)から起動され、目的のリポジトリにアクセスできる Uyuniサーバが直接または要塞経由でPAYGインスタンス(理想的には同じリージョン内)に接続できる A basic SUSE Customer Center account is required. Enter your valid SUSE Customer Center credentials in Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials. This account is required for accessing the Uyuni client tools for boostrapping regardless of PAYG instances. If you bootstrap the PAYG instance to Uyuni, Uyuni will disable its PAYG repositories then add repositories from where it mirrored the data from the RMT server. The final result will be PAYG instances acquiring the same repositories from the RMT servers but through the Uyuni server itself. Of course repositories can still be setup primarily from SCC. Procedure: Connecting New PAYG Instance UyuniのWeb UIで、管理 セットアップウィザード PAYGに移動し、PAYGの追加をクリックします。 ページセクション［PAYGの接続の説明］から始めます。 ［説明］フィールドに、説明を追加します。 ページセクション［インスタンスSSH接続データ］に移動します。 ［ホスト］フィールドに、Uyuniから接続するインスタンスのDNSまたはIPアドレスを入力します。 ［SSHポート］フィールドに、ポート番号を入力するか、デフォルト値22を使用します。 ［ユーザ］フィールドに、クラウドで指定されているユーザ名を入力します。 ［パスワード］フィールドに、パスワードを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵］フィールドに、インスタンスキーを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵のパスフレーズ］フィールドに、キーパスフレーズを入力します。 認証キーは常にPEM形式である必要があります。 インスタンスに直接接続していないが、SSH要塞を介して接続している場合は、プロシージャ: SSH要塞接続データを追加するに進みます。 それ以外の場合は、プロシージャ: PAYGの接続を完了するに進みます。 プロシージャ: SSH要塞接続データを追加する ページセクション［要塞SSH接続データ］に移動します。 ［ホスト］フィールドに、要塞のホスト名を入力します。 ［SSHポート］フィールドに、要塞のポート番号を入力します。 ［ユーザ］フィールドに、要塞のユーザ名を入力します。 ［パスワード］フィールドに、要塞のパスワードを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵］フィールドに、要塞キーを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵のパスフレーズ］フィールドに、要塞キーのパスフレーズを入力します。 プロシージャ: PAYGの接続を完了するを使用してセットアッププロセスを完了します。 プロシージャ: PAYGの接続を完了する 新しいPAYG接続データの追加を完了するには、作成をクリックします。 PAYG接続データの［詳細］ページに戻ります。 更新された接続ステータスは、［情報］という名前の上部セクションに表示されます。 接続ステータスは、［ 管理 > セットアップウィザード > Pay-as-you-go］画面にも表示されます。 インスタンスの認証データが正しい場合、［ステータス］列に「資格情報が正常に更新されました」と表示されます。 いずれかの時点で無効なデータが入力されると、新しく作成されたインスタンスが［管理 > セットアップウィザード > PAYG］に表示され、［ステータス］列にエラーメッセージが表示されます。 サーバで認証データが利用可能になるとすぐに、利用可能な製品のリストが更新されます。 利用可能な製品は、PAYGインスタンスにインストールされているものと同じ製品ファミリおよびアーキテクチャのすべてのバージョンです。たとえば、インスタンスにSLES 15 SP1製品がインストールされている場合、SLES 15 SP2、SLES 15 SP3、SLES 15 SP4、およびSLES 15 SP5が［管理 > セットアップウィザード > 製品］に自動的に表示されます。 製品が利用可能として表示されたら、ユーザは、製品名の横にあるチェックボックスを選択し製品の追加をクリックして、Uyuniに製品を追加できます。 成功メッセージの後、［ソフトウェア > チャンネル一覧 > すべて］に移動して、Web UIで新しく追加されたチャンネルを確認できます。 各チャンネルの同期の進行状況を監視するには、Uyuniサーバの /var/log/rhn/reposyncディレクトリにあるログファイルを確認します。 If a product is provided by both the PAYG instance and one of the SUSE Customer Center subscriptions, it will appear only once in the products list. When the channels belonging to that product are synced, the data might still come from the SCC subscription, and not from the Pay-As-You-Go instance. 以下の手順では、インスタンスのSSH接続データを削除する方法について説明します。 プロシージャ: インスタンスへの接続データを削除する ［管理 > セットアップウィザード > PAYG］を開きます。 既存のインスタンスのリストでインスタンスを見つけます。 インスタンスの詳細をクリックします。 削除を選択し、選択を確認します。 インスタンスのリストに戻ります。 削除したインスタンスは表示されなくなります。 Uyuniサーバは、インスタンスから収集された資格情報を使用してRMTサーバに接続し、reposyncを使用してパッケージをダウンロードします。これらの資格情報は、taskomaticにより、定義されたSSH接続データを使用して10分ごとに更新されます。RMTサーバへの接続では、常にPAYGインスタンスから収集された最新の既知の認証資格情報が使用されます。 PAYGインスタンスの資格情報収集のステータスは、［ステータス］列またはインスタンスの詳細ページに表示されます。インスタンスに到達できない場合、資格情報の更新プロセスは失敗し、2回目に更新が失敗すると資格情報は無効になります。資格情報が無効な場合、チャンネルの同期は失敗します。これを避けるには、接続されているインスタンスの実行状態を維持します。 PAYGインスタンスは、SSH接続データが明示的に削除されない限り、Uyuniサーバに接続されたままになります。インスタンスへのSSH接続データを削除するには、プロシージャ: インスタンスへの接続データを削除するを使用します。 PAYGインスタンスは、Uyuniサーバから常にアクセスできるとは限りません。 インスタンスが存在するが停止している場合は、最新の既知の資格情報を使用してインスタンスへの接続が試行されます。 資格情報が有効である期間は、クラウドプロバイダによって異なります。 インスタンスが存在しなくなったが、SUMAに登録されている場合、その資格情報は無効になり、認証は失敗します。 エラーメッセージは［ステータス］列に表示されます。 エラーメッセージは、インスタンスが使用できないことを示すだけです。インスタンスのステータスに関する詳細な診断は、クラウドプロバイダで実行する必要があります。 PAYGインスタンスで次のアクションまたは変更を行うと、資格情報が機能しなくなります。 * zypper資格情報ファイルの削除 * インポートした証明書の削除 * /etc/hostsからのクラウド固有エントリの削除 資格情報をSaltクライアントとして収集する場所からPAYGインスタンスを登録できます。 インスタンスには有効なクラウド接続が登録されている必要があります。登録されていないとチャンネルにアクセスできません。 ユーザがクラウドパッケージを削除すると、資格情報の収集が機能しなくなる場合があります。 最初にPAYGインスタンスを設定して、認証データを収集し、チャンネルを同期できるようにします。 残りのプロセスは、パブリッククラウド以外のクライアントの場合と同じで、チャンネルの同期、ブートストラップスクリプトの自動作成、アクティベーションキーの作成、および登録の開始で構成されます。 クライアントの登録の詳細については、クライアントの登録を参照してください。 資格情報の確認 スクリプトが資格情報の収集に失敗した場合、ログとWeb UIに適切なエラーメッセージが表示されます。 資格情報が機能しない場合は、reposyncに適切なエラーが表示されます。 registercloudguestを使用する パブリッククラウド更新インフラストラクチャへのregistercloudguest接続を更新または変更しても、資格情報の使用に支障はありません。 cloudguestコマンドを使用して新しいクラウド接続が登録されていない場合、registercloudguest --cleanを実行すると問題が発生します。","title":"PAYGインスタンスの接続","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"connect-payg","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/connect-payg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Logical Volume Management (LVM) 以下の表は、x86-64およびARMアーキテクチャのUyuniサーバおよびプロキシのハードウェアとソフトウェアの要件を説明しています。 Uyuni for Retailハードウェアの要件については、Retail Requirementsを参照してください。 SLE Micro 5.5 is ths operation system of the container host and requires as free disk space: Minimum for base installation 100 GB Plus a minimum of 130 GB for repository data By default the Uyuni Server container stores mirrored repository (packages or products), database, and other data in subdirectories of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/ directory. Repository synchronization fails if this directory runs out of disk space. Estimate how much space the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/ directory requires based on the number and kind of clients and repositories you plan to mirror. ファイルシステムとパーティションの詳細については、永続ストレージとパーミッションおよびこのガイドのインストールと配備のセクションにある詳細なインストール手順を参照してください。 Table 1. サーバハードウェアの要件 Hardware Details Recommendation CPU x86-64, ARM, ppc64le or s390x Minimum 4 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores RAM Minimum 16 GB Recommended 32 GB Disk Space / (root directory) 20 GB /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Minimum 150 GB (depending on the number of products) /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql Minimum 50 GB The images by default have a 20 GB / partition. The cloud image of SLE Micro 5.5 has just a 5 GB / partition. Both work flawlessly with Uyuni. As long as external storage is mounted to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes, Uyuni does not need or use storage on the / partition, but leaves that to the management of the container host itself. Uyuniのパフォーマンスは、ハードウェアリソース、ネットワーク帯域幅、クライアントとサーバ間の遅延などによって異なります。 経験および使用されているさまざまな配備に基づいて、適切な数のプロキシを備えたUyuniサーバの最適なパフォーマンスを得るためには、単一サーバあたり10,000クライアントを超えないようにすることをお勧めします。 クライアント数が10,000を超える場合は、ハブのセットアップに移行し、コンサルティングを利用することを強くお勧めします。 微調整と適切な数のプロキシを使用しても、このような多数のクライアントによって、パフォーマンスの問題が生じる可能性があります。 多数のクライアント管理の詳細については、Multiple Servers with Hub to Manage Large Scale Deploymentsを参照してください。 Table 2. プロキシのハードウェア要件 Hardware Details Recommendation CPU x86-64, ARM Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores RAM Minimum 2 GB Recommended 8 GB Disk Space / (root directory) Minimum 40 GB /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Minimum 150 GB By default the Uyuni Proxy container caches packages in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory. If there is not enough space available, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages. この動作の結果は以下のとおりです。 プロキシ上の /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/ディレクトリの容量を大きくすると、プロキシとUyuniサーバ間のトラフィックが少なくなります。 プロキシ上の/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/ディレクトリをUyuniサーバ上の/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/と同じサイズにすることで、最初に同期した後のトラフィック量の増大が防止されます。 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/ディレクトリは、Uyuniサーバ上ではプロキシと比べて小さくできます。サイズの推定のガイドについては、サーバ要件のセクションを参照してください。 PostgreSQLはサポートされている唯一のデータベースです。PostgreSQLデータベースとともにリモートのPostgreSQLデータベースやリモートのファイルシステム(NFS など)を使用することはサポートされていません。つまり、PostgreSQLは、Uyuniで使用可能な最速のストレージデバイス上に存在する必要があります。 パフォーマンスの問題が発生する可能性があるため、PostgreSQLデータベースをUyuniからリモートで実行することは推奨されません。このような環境は可能であり、さらには多くの場合安定していますが、何か問題が発生した場合、データ損失のリスクが常にあります。 永続ボリュームは、コンテナの配備時にデフォルトで作成されます。 However, it is recommended that the volumes are stored on one or more separate storage devices. Such a setup helps avoid data loss in production environments. This can be done after container deployment. Storage devices best should be set up after first deploying the container. For more details, see Persistent Container Volumes. We recommend you use XFS as the filesystem type for all volumes. The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with Uyuni. See the tables in this section for guides to estimate the size required. Uyuniサーバで、次のコマンドを使用して、利用できるすべてのストレージデバイスを検索します。 hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"デバイスファイル:\" lsblkコマンドを使用して、各デバイスの名前とサイズを表示します。 Use the mgr-storage-server command with the device names to set up the external disks as the locations for the storage and, optionally on a disk of its own, for the database: mgr-storage-server [] 外部ストレージボリュームは、/manager_storageおよび/pgsql_storageにマウントされているXFSパーティションとして設定されます。 チャンネルデータとデータベースの両方に同じストレージデバイスを使用できます。これはお勧めしません。その理由は、チャンネルリポジトリが大きくなると、ストレージがいっぱいになり、データベースの一貫性が損なわれるリスクが生じるためです。別々のストレージデバイスを使用すると、パフォーマンスが向上する場合もあります。1つのストレージデバイスを使用する場合、1つのデバイス名パラメータを指定してmgr-storage-serverを実行します。 If you are installing a proxy, the mgr-storage-proxy command takes only one device name parameter and will set up the external storage location as the Squid cache. For all kind of virtual machines (VM), LVM is generally not needed and not recommended. The disk setup is virtual and separate disks for volumes are possible and recommended. For other deployments, separate disks for volumes are also recommended. On the Uyuni Server, the mgr-storage-server command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. Optionally, if a second device name is specified, mgr-storage-server moves the content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql database directory to a second separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql. Similarily on the Uyuni Proxy, the mgr-storage-proxy command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes.","title":"ハードウェア要件","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. サーバ要件","hash":"server-hardware-requirements","id":1},{"text":"2. プロキシ要件","hash":"_プロキシ要件","id":2},{"text":"3. データベースの要件","hash":"installation-postgresql-requirements","id":3},{"text":"4. 永続ストレージとパーミッション","hash":"install-hardware-requirements-storage","id":4},{"text":"5.

These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. UyuniのWeb UIに組織の資格情報を入力します。 プロシージャ: 組織の資格情報の入力 SUSE ManagerのWeb UIで、メインメニュー 管理 セットアップウィザードに移動します。 ［セットアップウィザード］ページで、組織の資格情報タブに移動します。 Add a new credential（新しい資格情報の追加）をクリックします。 ユーザ名およびパスワードを入力し、保存をクリックします。 A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center UyuniのWeb UIで、管理 セットアップウィザードに移動します。 ［セットアップウィザード］ページから、SUSE製品タブを選択します。 Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This table lists architecture, channels, and status information. For more information, see Wizard.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

For clients that are connected to the SUSE Customer Center, use mgr-sync. For all other clients, use spacewalk-repo-sync. The primary use of mgr-sync is to connect to the SUSE Customer Center, retrieve product and package information, and prepare channels for synchronization with the Uyuni Server. このツールは、SUSEサポートサブスクリプションで使用するように設計されています。 openSUSE、CentOS、Ubuntuなどのオープンソースディストリビューションには必要ありません。 mgr-syncに使用できるコマンドおよび引数を以下の表に一覧表示しています。 mgr-syncコマンドには次の構文を使用します。 mgr-sync [-h] [--version] [-v] [-s] [-d {1,2,3}] {list,add,refresh,delete} Table 1. mgr-syncコマンド Command Description Example Use list List channels, organization credentials, or products mgr-sync list channels add Add channels, organization credentials, or products mgr-sync add channel refresh Refresh the local copy of products, channels, and subscriptions mgr-sync refresh delete Delete existing SCC organization credentials from the local system mgr-sync delete credentials sync Synchronize specified channel or ask for it when left blank mgr-sync sync channel コマンドに固有のオプションの全リストを表示するには、次のコマンドを使用します。 mgr-sync --help Table 2. mgr-syncオプション引数 オプション 短縮オプション 説明 使用例 help h コマンドの使用方法とオプションを表示する mgr-sync --help version N/A 現在インストールされているバージョンのmgr-syncを表示する mgr-sync --version verbose v 詳細な出力を提供する mgr-sync --verbose refresh store-credentials s 資格情報をローカルの隠しファイルに保存する mgr-sync --store-credentials debug d 追加のデバッグ情報をログに記録する。レベル 1、2、3が必要です。3は、最も多くのデバッグ情報を提供します。 mgr-sync -d 3 refresh no-sync N/A add コマンドと一緒に使用して、同期を開始せずに製品またはチャンネルを追加する mgr-sync --no-sync add mgr-syncのログは次の場所にあります。 /var/log/rhn/mgr-sync.log /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_api.log The spacewalk-repo-sync tool synchronizes software repositories into Uyuni channels. In most cases, this happens automatically, but you can use the tool to run it manually if required. The spacewalk-repo-sync tool has these primary commands: Table 3. spacewalk-repo-sync Options Option Description Example Use list List all custom channels and the repositories assigned to them. spacewalk-repo-sync --list channel Synchronize a single channel to all repositories assigned to it. spacewalk-repo-sync --channel deep-verify ignore cached package checksums. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify force-all-errata force re-importing all the patches. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify no-packages excludes packages from the operation. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify --no-packages For a complete list of options, see the spacewalk-repo-sync manpage: man spacewalk-repo-sync If you are having trouble synchronizing with spacewalk-repo-sync you can find out more by watching the HTTP log as the command runs. Procedure: Troubleshooting Synchronization Problems Log the HTTP output into /var/log/zypper.log: ZYPP_MEDIA_CURL_DEBUG=2 spacewalk-repo-sync --channel Export the setting: export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG Start the synchronization: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel --type yum You can increase the debug level, by adding the [option]``-vvv`` option to the command. When the complete completes, or fails, disable debug mode: unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG You can add custom HTTP headers to the requests made by spacewalk-repo-sync at the time of synchronization. The custom HTTP headers are defined in the /etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf configuration file. The headers can be defined by repository name or channel label. You can also define global headers by putting them in the main section. For example: [testchannel] X-MY-HEADER-1=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-2=VALUE [mychannel] X-MY-HEADER-3=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-4=VALUE [main] X-MYGLOBAL-HEADER=VALUE This can be particularly useful when dealing with Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repositories in the public cloud.","title":"Synchronization CLI Tools","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"cli-sync","url":"/uyuni/reference/cli-sync.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Comparing containerized and non-containerized workflows 5. Validating Saltboot group configuration To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server 4.3 or newer one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using Uyuni Server 4.3 or newer. Older images will not work. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configure DHCP for PXE booting. See DHCPd Formula how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server. Without using DHCP formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. See below for example. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Follow guide システムグループ to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. With this, our branch group is converted to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot Groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. See Terminal Names for explanation of possible configurations. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server 4.3 where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is build and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Non-Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with what parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Quick set up of Uyuni for Retail using for Retail tools 3. Setup partitioning 4. Synchronize images To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies one or more POS images built This guide works only with non-containerized Uyuni for Retail branch proxy 4.3 In this example we consider architecture with dedicated network for POS terminals where branch server provides all required services including DHCP and DNS. For dedicated network we assume 192.168.86.0/24 network. In this example we provide salt and ftp CNAMEs for Saltboot service discovery. We assume to have one regular branch server with salt minion id branch1.mystore.com, which is equal to the branch server fully qualified domain name, and branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. This example covers two configuration methods with both of them achieving same result. Uyuni for Retail provides command line tool retail_branch_init Uyuni for Retail provides mass import command line tool retail_yaml The branch server can be configured automatically using the retail_branch_init command, as shown in this section. Procedure: Configuring Branch Server Formulas With a Helper Script Run following command on Uyuni Server: retail_branch_init branch1.mystore.com --dedicated-nic eth1 \\ --branch-prefix B0001 \\ --server-domain branch1.mystore.com \\ --branch-ip 192.168.86.1 \\ --dyn-range 192.168.86.10 192.168.86.250 \\ --netmask 255.255.255.0 You can use the retail_branch_init --help command for additional options. Verify that your changes have been configured correctly by checking the Uyuni Web UI branch server system formulas. Apply highstate on the branch server. Similar results can be achieved by using mass import command line tool. Procedure: Configuring Branch Server Formulas With a Mass Import Tool Prepare branch specific YAML file: For example, create branch.yaml file with content: branches: branch1.mystore.com: branch_prefix: B0001 server_domain: branch1.mystore.com nic: eth1 dedicated_nic: true configure_firewall: true branch_ip: 192.168.86.1 netmask: 255.255.255.0 dyn_range: - 192.168.86.10 - 192.168.86.250 For more information about mass import tool, see Mass Configuration. Import branch information from YAML file to Uyuni retail_yaml --from-yaml branch.yaml Verify that your changes have been configured correctly by checking the Uyuni Web UI branch server system formulas. Apply highstate on the branch server. Both retail_branch_init and retail_yaml commands override existing configuration settings of the specified branch server. After the initial configuration done by command line tools, branch server configuration can be further adjusted in Uyuni Web UI through branch server formulas. Follow システムグループ to create HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 system group. Partitioning is specific to the hardware type and configured using Saltboot formula.

Deploying new images 1.1. Controlling image versions This file describes how to deploy a new image on selected terminals first, test it, and then deploy it to all terminals. The hardware type group (i.e. HWTYPE group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the Saltboot formula. This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. Procedure: Dual group image deployment Build new image. Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Uyuni Server 2. Build Hosts 3. Branch Servers 4. Point-of-Service Terminals 5. Fitting It All Together 5.1. Hardware Types 5.2. Branch System Groups 5.3. Salt Formulas 5.4. Saltboot Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see イメージの構築と管理. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see PrometheusとGrafanaを使用したモニタリング. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The Saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the Saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the Saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the Saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Image Synchronizing to the Branch Server If you have very large images that you need to synchronize to the branch server, you can use delta images to save network bandwidth. A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be - and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar in the database. Performance tuning is possible with the -B option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure the Server to Auto-Accept 2. Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains 3. Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot You can configure Uyuni to automatically accept the keys of newly deployed terminals. This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see [retail.deployterminals.auto.once]. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, which is preserved in etc-salt volume. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept At the command prompt of the Uyuni container host, as root, enter the server container: mgrctl term Inside the container, execute the following steps: In directory /etc/salt/master.d/, create file autosign_grains.conf and specify autosign_grains_dir: echo \"autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains\" \\ > /etc/salt/master.d/autosign_grains.conf Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot (replace with the key: mkdir /etc/salt/autosign_grains echo \"\" > /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key For multiple keys, put each one on a new line. For more information about configuring the server to automatically accept grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/autoaccept_grains.html. Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details.

Deploy Terminals over a Wireless Network 2.1. Change Wireless Credentials 2.2. Use Multiple Wireless Networks If you are not able to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if= of= When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. イメージを構築します。 Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration.

Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Manual synchronization of images is needed only when using non-containerized Uyuni for Retail 4.3 branch server. Image synchronization downloads system and boot images from the Uyuni Server to the Uyuni for Retail branch server. This may involve updating default boot image for not yet registered terminals. Default boot image can be set in the Image Synchronize formula. If default boot image is not set, boot image with highest version is used as default boot image. This behaviour can be disabled by unchecking Use Latest Boot Image checkbox in the Image Synchronize formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. Create the top.sls file with content: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Create the saltboot_proto.sls file with content: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp saltboot_proto.sls server:/srv/pillar/ Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. Create the top.sls file with content: base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Create the $branch_prefix.sls file with content: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp $branch_prefix.sls server:/srv/pillar/","title":"Deployment basics","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Partitioning and Image Deployment Formula Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your Uyuni for Retail installation. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to apply common Uyuni formulas. For the most commonly used formulas, see Salt Formulas. All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server. The following formulas can be used for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3 with Uyuni 5.0: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula In addition, Bind and DHCPd formulas can be used, but not on the branch server because SLE Micro does not have Bind and DHCPd in the repositories. Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services. Use the Saltboot formula to specify disk partitioning, and to select which image should be deployed.

Synchronize Images to the Branch Server To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies, or containerized proxy one or more Uyuni build hosts This section covers how to configure your Uyuni for Retail environment, including: Prepare POS images Prepare system groups Configure services for Saltboot Synchronize POS images to the branch servers The very first time you set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps. You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see イメージの構築と管理. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. システムグループの詳細については、システムグループを参照してください。 During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see PrometheusとGrafanaを使用したモニタリング. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansibleの統合. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server ; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server ; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly. For more information about Image Synchronization Formula, see Image Synchronization Formula.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment with non-containerized 4.3 branch server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup-43","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup-43.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured using so called Saltboot Group. Saltboot Group is a branch groups, system group with branch id as its name created in previous step, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula previously used in Uyuni for Retail setups. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states.

Saltboot requires instructions how to partitioning terminal harddisk and what image to deploy. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types and partitioning, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Uyuni for Retail 2024.12 no longer need manual image synchronization, all images are available to all clients automatically.

Branch Server Mass Configuration 1.1. Configure Multiple Branch Servers 2. Terminal Mass Configuration 2.1. Configure Multiple Terminals 3. Export Configuration to Mass Configuration File Mass configuration is possible with branch servers and terminals. Mass configuration tool was not yet adapted for containerized saltboot workflow. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Network Configuration 1.1. Shared Network Architecture 1.2. Externally Managed Dedicated Network Architecture 1.3. Dedicated Network Architecture (using 4.3 branch server) Uyuni for Retail uses a layered architecture: The first layer contains the Uyuni Server. The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services. It also contains one or more build hosts. The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see コンテナ化されたUyuniプロキシの設定. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements. The branch server and the terminals are connected to the same network as the Uyuni Server. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network. The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides proxy, PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network. The branch servers are in the same network as the Uyuni Server, and terminals use an isolated branch network. In this configuration, the branch servers are in the corporate network, and provide all DHCP, DNS, PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in the branch networks.","title":"Network Architecture","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-network-arch","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-network-arch.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Cached Terminal Updates If the Uyuni Server is offline, you can still perform some operations on the terminals. This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded. When the terminal is rebooted and an uptodate POS image is found in the service partition, the terminal will automatically use this cached image for system redeployment.","title":"Offline Use","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-offline","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-offline.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains 2. Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values 3. Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call 4. Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Systems provisioned by Saltboot are usually redeployed or repartitioned automatically when a new image is available, or Saltboot partitioning changes. Occasionally, however, it is needed to force Saltboot to redeploy an image or repartition disk, even when automation would not do so. For these situations, Saltboot offers three ways to force redeployment or repartitioning: Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Repartitioning of a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions. Saltboot redeployment grains have no side effects, and do not require any further configuration. The limitation is that terminal must be accessible by salt. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Procedure: Forcing a Saltboot to repartition the hard disk On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_repartition Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Saltboot custom values remove the limitation on terminal being reachable by salt, however there are configuration steps. Custom info keys and values can be also managed using API or spacecmd command. For more information, see custominfo. Procedure: Create custom info key for image redeployment In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Custom System Info. Click Create Key to create new Custom Info Key. As Key Label fill in saltboot_force_redeploy. As Description fill in Force redeploy Saltboot image. Click Create Key. Creating saltboot_force_redeploy custom key is a one time operation. When created, it is available for repeated use.

From the list of available keys click saltboot_force_redeploy. As Value type True. Click Update Key. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment custom info setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. Procedure: Create custom info key for disk repartitioning Navigate to menu::Systems[Custom System Info] page. Click Create Key to create new Custom Info Key. As Key Label fill in saltboot_force_repartition. As Description fill in Force terminal disk repartition. Click Create Key. Creating saltboot_force_repartition custom key is one time operation.

Click on Create Value. From the list of available keys click saltboot_force_repartition. As Value type True. Click Update Key. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. An API call system.setPillar can be used to set specific Saltboot options through Salt pillar data. Uyuni Saltboot integration is using tuning-saltboot pillar category to manage Saltboot tuning, including forced redeployment or disk repartition. Using this pillar category allows Uyuni to reset Saltboot flag once the terminal is booted up. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image using API call using spacecmd command In the console run following the command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_redeployment\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to repartition disk using API call using spacecmd command In the console run the following command, replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_repartition\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Check Saltboot tuning options In the console run the following command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot' system.getPillar Make sure to use tuning-saltboot as pillar category in the API call. Pillars specified outside of Uyuni database cannot be reset automatically. Without manual intervention, the terminal will download a new image on each reboot. Procedure: Force a Saltboot to redeploy image using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_redeploy.sls with content: saltboot: force_redeploy: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_redeploy Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.

Naming by FQDN 4. Assign Hostnames to Terminals Terminals can be named according to certain parameters, which can make it easier to match the physical device with its record in the Uyuni Web UI. Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, and HWType. Naming scheme can be selected in the Branch Network formula. For more information, see Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID 例: B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID 例: B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 例: B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: hwAddress: hwtype: Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes.

Register the Branch Server This section covers Uyuni for Retail Branch Server installation and setup, using these procedures: ソフトウェアチャンネルの追加 同期ステータスの確認 クライアントでGPGキーを信頼する Register the Branch Server and Terminals as Clients The Uyuni for Retail Branch Server is a Uyuni Proxy with additional Retail features. For proxy installation procedures, see コンテナ化されたUyuniプロキシの設定. Then continue with the following sections. Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. このプロシージャで必要な製品は次のとおりです。 Table 1. openSUSEチャンネル - CLI OS Version openSUSE Leap 15.4 Base Channel opensuse_leap15_4 Client Channel opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-updates Non-OSS Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss Non-OSS Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates Backports Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates SLE Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates プロシージャ: コマンドプロンプトからのソフトウェアチャンネルの追加 Uyuni サーバのコマンドプロンプトで root になり、spacewalk-common-channels コマンドを特定のチャンネルに対して実行します: spacewalk-common-channels \\ \\ \\ \\ ... チャンネルの同期: mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels プロシージャ: 同期の進捗状況の確認 UyuniのWeb UIで、ソフトウェア 管理 チャンネルに移動し、リポジトリに関連付けられているチャンネルをクリックします。 ［リポジトリ］タブに移動し、［同期］をクリックし、［同期状態］をクリックします。 プロシージャ: コマンドプロンプトから同期の進捗状況を確認する Uyuniサーバのコマンドプロンプトで、rootとして、tailコマンドを使用して同期ログファイルを確認します。 tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSEチャンネルは非常に大きいことがあります。 同期に数時間かかる場合があります。 By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. プロシージャ: クライアントでGPGキーを信頼する On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key If you are bootstrapping clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) アクティベーションキーの作成の詳細については、アクティベーションキーを参照してください。 You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels クライアントの登録については、クライアントの登録を参照してください。 A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see コンテナ化されたUyuniプロキシの設定. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types. Configure the proxy to become a branch server. On the Uyuni for Retail Server, for example, run: retail_branch_init --dedicated-nic eth1 \\ --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \\ --netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \\ --server-domain branch.example.org \\ --branch-prefix uyuni For additional options, use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.","title":"Retail Uyuni Branch Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-uyuni-branchserver","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-uyuni-branchserver.html","titles":[{"text":"1. ソフトウェアチャンネルの追加","hash":"_ソフトウェアチャンネルの追加","id":1},{"text":"2. 同期ステータスの確認","hash":"_同期ステータスの確認","id":2},{"text":"3. クライアントでGPGキーを信頼する","hash":"_クライアントでgpgキーを信頼する","id":3},{"text":"4.

In this example we provide salt on kernel command line option and ftp in pillar for Saltboot service discovery. We assume to have one regular branch server with salt minion id branch1.mystore.com, which is equal to the branch server fully qualified domain name, and branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. There is already existing external DHCP and DNS service. DHCP service is correctly configured to PXE boot from branch server. Follow guide システムグループ to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group.s For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign following formulas to the branch server: Branch Network Pxe Tftpd Procedure: Assign formulas to the branch server Select the Formulas tab for the system branch1.mystore.com You should see list of formulas in Configuration sub-tab In displayed list select Branch Network In displayed list select Pxe In displayed list select Tftpd Save assigned formulas by clicking Save in top right corner Procedure: Configure Branch Network formula Select Branch Network formula from branch server formula list Unselect Dedicated Nic check-box because we are not using dedicated network Keep the rest with default values In Terminal Naming and Identification section edit Branch Identification and set it to our branch id B0001 Save the formula Procedure: Configure Pxe formula Select Pxe formula from branch server formula list At the end of Kernel Command Line Parameters append MASTER=branch1.mystore.com Keep the rest with default values Save the formula Procedure: Configure Tftpd formula Select Tftpd formula from branch server formula list Set Internal Network Address to 0.0.0.0, this way tftp will be listening on any IPv4 Set TFTP base directory to /srv/saltboot Save the formula Next two formulas are group formulas. Make sure you are editing those formulas in their respective groups. Group formulas are visible as assigned also on system level, but editing them will create system specific setting instead of group setting. Assign Saltboot Group formula to the B0001 group and Saltboot formula to the HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 group.

When the Uyuni Server attempts to reach these repositories to check that they are valid, the firewall drops the requests, and the synchronization continues to wait for the response until it times out. これが発生する場合、同期が失敗するまで長時間かかり、SUSE以外の製品が製品リストに表示されません。 この問題はさまざまな方法で修正できます。 最も簡単な方法は、SUSE以外のリポジトリで必要なURLへのアクセスを許可するようにファイアウォールを設定することです。 これにより、同期プロセスがURLに到達し、正常に完了することができます。 外部トラフィックを許可できない場合は、UyuniからのREJECT(DROPではない)要求を行うようにファイアウォールを設定してください。 これにより、サードパーティURLへの要求が拒否されるため、同期はタイムアウトではなく早期に失敗し、製品はリストに表示されません。 ファイアウォールへの設定アクセス権がない場合は、代わりにUyuniサーバに別のファイアウォールを設定することを検討してください。","title":"ファイアウォールのトラブルシューティング","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tshoot-firewalls","url":"/uyuni/administration/troubleshooting/tshoot-firewalls.html","titles":[]},"239":{"id":239,"text":"WebUIで、あるいはディストリビューションまたはシステム設定へのAPIコールを介して実行される変更によっては、UyuniサーバからUyuniプロキシシステムにファイルを転送するために、cobbler syncコマンドが必要になる場合があります。これを実現するために、Cobblerは/etc/cobbler/settingsで指定されたプロキシのリストを使用します。 cobbler syncは、その設計上、変更されたファイルや最近追加されたファイルのみを同期することはできません。 代わりに、cobbler syncを実行すると、/etc/cobbler/settingsで設定された指定のすべてのプロキシに/srv/tftpbootディレクトリの完全同期がトリガされます。また、関連するシステム間のWAN接続の遅延によっても影響を受けます。 /var/log/cobbler/のログによると、同期のプロセスが完了するまでにかなりの時間がかかる場合があります。 たとえば、次の日時に開始したとします。 Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running python triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* そして、次の日時に終了したとします。 Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/post/* Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | shell triggers finished successfully 転送量は約1.8GBでした。 転送には30分ほどかかりました。 比較すると、/srv/tftbootと同じサイズの大きな単一ファイルのコピーは、数分以内に完了します。 Uyuniサーバとプロキシ間でファイルをコピーするためにrsyncベースのアプローチに切り替えると、転送時間と待機時間を短縮できる場合があります。 このタスクを実行するためのスクリプトは、https://suse.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/1i000000gLOd/a/1i000000ll5B/B2AmvIJN2_JsAyjTQzCVP_x5ioVgd0bYN9X9NpMugS8でダウンロードできます。 このスクリプトはコマンドラインオプションを受け入れません。 スクリプトを実行する前に、手動で編集し、SUMAHOSTNAME、SUMAIP、およびSUMAPROXY1変数を正しく設定して、スクリプトが正しく機能するようにする必要があります。 スクリプトの個々の調整に利用可能なサポートはありません。 スクリプトと内部のコメントは、プロセスの概要と考慮すべきステップを提供することを目的としています。 さらにサポートが必要な場合は、SUSEコンサルティングにお問い合わせください。 スクリプトを使用した提案されるアプローチは、次の環境で役立ちます。 Uyuni Proxy systems are connected via a WAN connection; /srv/tftbootに多数のディストリビューション用ファイルおよびクライアントPXEブートファイル(合計数千ファイル)が含まれている。 /etc/cobbler/settingsの任意のプロキシは無効になっているが、それ以外の場合、Uyuniは引き続きプロキシとコンテンツを同期する。 #proxies: # - \"sumaproxy.sumaproxy.test\" # - \"sumaproxy2.sumaproxy.test\" Procedure: Analyzing New Sync Speed Uyuniと関連するシステム間のTCPトラフィックのダンプを取得します。 On Uyuni Server: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh On Uyuni Proxy: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh これにより、分析を実行するのに十分な200のパッケージサイズのみがキャプチャされます。 プロキシと通信するためにUyuniが使用する各ネットワークインタフェースにehtXを調整します。 最後に、さらにパッケージ数を削減するため、ssh通信はキャプチャされません。 cobbler syncを開始します。 同期を強制するため、最初にCobbler jsonキャッシュファイルを削除してから、cobbler syncを発行します。 rm /var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json cobbler sync cobbler syncが終了したら、TCPdumpsを停止します。 Wiresharkを使用してTCPdumpsを開き、［Statistics（統計） > Conversations（対話）］に移動して、ダンプが分析されるのを待ちます。 Switch to the TCP tab.

降順にソートして続行し、カーネルやinitrdの転送など、大きなファイルの最大値を確認します。 ポート4505と4506はSalt通信に使用されるため無視してください。 TCPdumpsの分析では、Uyuniサーバからプロキシへの、サイズが約1800バイトの小さなファイルの転送に約0.3秒かかったことを示しています。 大きなファイルは多くありませんでしたが、小さなファイルの数が多いため、転送されるファイルごとに新しいTCP接続が作成され、確立された接続数が多くなりました。 したがって、最小転送時間と必要な接続数(たとえば、約5000)がわかれば、転送時間全体の概算推定時間が得られます(5000 * 0.3 / 60 =

Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_5 \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see openSUSE Leapクライアントの登録. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see openSUSE Leapクライアントの登録. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL証明書. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. Uyuni Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

Fill in the account information fields, including an email for system notifications. Click Create Organization to finish creating your administration account. When you have completed the Uyuni Web UI setup, you are taken to the Home Overview page. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table.

Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help ): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Creating a distribution wiere spacecmd sets localhost instead of FQDN 2. spacecmd not accepting commands or options 3. spacecmd caching problems This section provides troubleshooting solutions when working with spacecmd Situation When creating a distribution with spacecmd it will automatically set localhost as the server name instead of the FQDN of Uyuni. This will result in the following kernel option being written: install=http://localhost/ks/dist/ Resolution Set the FQDN in $HOME/.spacecmd/config like the following: test:~/.spacecmd # cat config [spacecmd] server=test.mytest.env username=admin password=password nossl=0 Cause This problem may be experienced if $HOME/.spacecmd/config has been created and the server name option was set to localhost. When running spacecmd non-interactively: you must escape arguments passed to the command. always put -- before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments. make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted. An example of a well-formed spacecmd command: spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \\'My Channel\\' -l channel1 -a x86_64 The spacecmd command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block//queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block//queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"456":{"id":456,"text":"When XMLRPC API is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2. Example Python Script for Relay Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # Authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate) client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds) # Perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Auto-Connect Authentication Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers. However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. Listing 3. Example Python Script for Auto-Connect Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) loginResponse = client.hub.loginWithAutoconnectMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) hubSessionKey = loginResponse[\"SessionKey\"] # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # Perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey)","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-auth","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-auth.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"461":{"id":461,"text":"Table of Contents 1. Architecture 2. Setup 2.1. Create a DB user for the reporting 3. Database Schema 4. Data Generation and Update 4.1. Tuning Reporting Jobs 4.2. report_db_batch_size 4.3. report_db_hub_workers The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral Uyuni Servers. The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. For more information about certificates, see specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-reqs.adoc#lsd-hub-reqs-certs. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Navigate to Help Report Database Schema to find the schema documentation. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

This document refers to these additional servers as peripheral servers. Any number of clients registered to the peripheral servers. Ensure the Hub Server and all peripheral servers are running Uyuni 5.0 or higher. Deploy the central Uyuni Server, which acts as the Hub Server, with the mgradm command.

For example: mgradm install podman suma.example.com --hubxmlrpc-replicas 1 For more information about hub server deployment, see Hub Deployment with XMLRPC. The Hub Server must not have clients registered to it. Clients should only be registered to the Peripheral Servers. The Hub Server’s and the Peripheral Servers' SSL certificates must be signed by the same CA. There are two ways to fulfill this requirement: Use third party certificates. Deploy the Hub Server first and use it to generate the certificates for the Peripheral Servers. For more information, see Generate the Certificates for Peripheral Servers. If you will use third party provided Certificates, you can skip this procedure. Procedure: Generating the Certificates for Peripheral Servers From the container host, enter the shell in the Hub Server container with: mgrctl term On the command line, run rhn-ssl-tool for each Peripheral Server (replace placeholders such as COUNTRY, STATE, example.com, etc. with values from your environment): rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-email=\"name@example.com\" \\ --set-hostname=\"HOSTNAME\" --set-cname=\"example.com\" Copy these files to the Peripheral Server host: /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT /root/ssl-build/HOSTNAME/server.crt /root/ssl-build/HOSTNAME/server.key Deploy the peripheral servers with mgradm.

Client Onboarding Rate 2. Clients and the RNG 3. Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys 4. Disabling the Salt Mine 5. Disable Unnecessary Taskomatic Jobs 6. Swap and Monitoring 7. AES Key Rotation This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments. Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt Mine to check client availability. The Salt Mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. Since the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt Mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered clients will have the Salt Mine disabled by default. If the Salt Mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt Mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. There is no hard maximum number of supported systems. Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured. There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information see Install Uyuni Proxy From Packages. Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use Uyuni for Retail to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals. There is an introduction to Uyuni for Retail in this book. Tuning and monitoring large scale deployments can differ from smaller installations. This book contains guidance for both tuning and monitoring within larger installations.","title":"Large Deployments Guide Overview","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"overview","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/overview.html","titles":[]},"466":{"id":466,"text":"Uyuni for Retail 2024.12 is an open source infrastructure management solution, optimized and tailored specifically for the retail industry. It uses the same technology as SUSE Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. For more information about setting up and using Uyuni for Retail, see Retail Guide Overview.","title":"Managing Large Scale Deployments in a Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-large-scale","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/retail-large-scale.html","titles":[]},"467":{"id":467,"text":"This section discusses how to set up a single Uyuni Server to manage a large number of clients.

Memory Usage Uyuni is designed by default to work on small and medium scale installations. For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters. Description The maximum number of HTTP requests served simultaneously by Apache httpd. Proxies, Web UI, and XMLRPC API clients each consume one. Requests exceeding the parameter will be queued and might result in timeouts. Tune when User count and proxy count increase significantly and this line appears in /var/log/apache2/error_log: […​] [mpm_prefork:error] [pid …​] AH00161: server reached MaxRequestWorkers setting, consider raising the MaxRequestWorkers setting. Value default 150 Value recommendation 150-500 Location /etc/apache2/server-tuning.conf, in the prefork.c section Example MaxClients = 200 After changing Immediately change ServerLimit and check maxThreads for possible adjustment. Notes This parameter was renamed to MaxRequestWorkers, both names are valid. More information https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mpm_common.html#maxrequestworkers Description The number of Apache httpd processes serving HTTP requests simultaneously. The number must equal MaxClients. Tune when MaxClients changes Value default 150 Value recommendation The same value as MaxClients Location /etc/apache2/server-tuning.conf, in the prefork.c section Example ServerLimit = 200 More information https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mpm_common.html#serverlimit Description The number of Tomcat threads dedicated to serving HTTP requests Tune when MaxClients changes. maxThreads must always be equal or greater than MaxClients Value default 150 Value recommendation The same value as MaxClients Location /etc/tomcat/server.xml Example More information https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/http.html Description The number of milliseconds before a non-responding AJP connection is forcibly closed. Tune when Client count increases significantly and AH00992, AH00877, and AH01030 errors appear in Apache error logs during a load peak. Value default 900000 Value recommendation 20000-3600000 Location /etc/tomcat/server.xml Example More information https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/http.html Description The number of milliseconds without data exchange from the JVM before a non-responding AJP connection is forcibly closed. Tune when Client count increases significantly and AH00992, AH00877, and AH01030 errors appear in Apache error logs during a load peak. Value default 300000 Value recommendation 20000-600000 Location /etc/tomcat/server.xml Example More information https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/config/http.html Description The maximum amount of memory Tomcat can use Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size is increased or OutOfMemoryException errors appear in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log Value default 1 GiB Value recommendation 4-8 GiB Location /etc/tomcat/conf.d/tomcat_java_opts.conf Example JAVA_OPTS=\"…​ -Xmx8G …​\" After changing Check memory usage More information https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html Description Disable displaying the update status for clients of a system group Tune when displaying the update status causes timeouts Value default false Value recommendation Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.disable_list_update_status = true After changing ? Notes More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum number of threads in Tomcat dedicated to asynchronous operations Tune when Client count increases significantly Value default 5 Value recommendation 50 - 150 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.message_queue_thread_pool_size = 50 After changing Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size, as each thread consumes a PostgreSQL connection, starvation might happen if the allocated connection pool is insufficient. Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. Notes Incoming Salt events are handled in separate thread pool, see java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum number of minions concurrently executing a scheduled action. Tune when Client count reaches several thousands and actions are not executed quickly enough. Value default 200 Value recommendation 200-500 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_batch_size = 300 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information Salt Rate Limiting Description The maximum number of threads in Tomcat dedicated to handling of incoming Salt events. Tune when The number of queued Salt events grows. Typically, this can happen during onboarding of large number of minions with higher value of java.salt_presence_ping_timeout. The number of events can be queried by echo \"select count(*) from susesaltevent;\" | spacewalk-sql --select-mode-direct - Value default 8 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_event_thread_pool_size = 50 After changing Check the length of Salt event queue. Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size, as each thread consumes a PostgreSQL connection, starvation might happen if the allocated connection pool is insufficient. Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. More information man rhn.conf Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. This parameter sets the amount of time before a second command (in most cases state.apply or any other Salt function) is sent to the client to verify its presence. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 4 seconds Value recommendation 4-20 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_timeout = 10 After changing Large java.salt_presence_ping_timeout value can reduce overall throughput. This can be compensated by increasing java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information Salt Timeouts Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. After java.salt_presence_ping_timeout seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (in most cases state.apply or any other Salt function) is sent to the client and if there is no response from the client for the amount of seconds specified with this parameter one more call (saltutil.find_job) is sent for a final check. This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered timeout. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 1 second Value recommendation 1-50 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 20 More information Salt Timeouts Description Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it. Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count increases significantly (more than 50), or more concurrent operations on channels are expected. Value default 2 Value recommendation 2-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers = 4 After changing Check taskomatic.java.maxmemory for adjustment, as every new thread will consume memory More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum amount of memory Taskomatic can use. Generation of metadata, especially for some OSs, can be memory-intensive, so this parameter might need raising depending on the managed OS mix. Tune when java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers increases, OSs are added to Uyuni (particularly Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu), or OutOfMemoryException errors appear in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log. Value default 4096 MiB Value recommendation 4096-16384 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.java.maxmemory = 8192 After changing Check memory usage. More information man rhn.conf Description The number of Taskomatic worker threads. Increasing this value allows Taskomatic to serve more clients in parallel. Tune when Client count increases significantly Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-200 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 100 After changing Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size and thread_pool for adjustment More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Cycle time for Taskomatic. Decreasing this value lowers the latency of Taskomatic. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 5000 ms Value recommendation 1000-5000 ms Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.scheduler.idleWaitTime = 1000 More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt clients as a result of actions being executed. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 1 Value recommendation 1-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.MinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 10 Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt SSH clients as a result of actions being executed. Tune when Client count is in the hundreds. Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.SSHMinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 40 Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections simultaneously available to both Tomcat and Taskomatic. If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving. Value default 20 Value recommendation 100 to 200, higher than the maximum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size + maxThreads and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example hibernate.c3p0.max_size = 100 After changing Check max_connections for adjustment. More information https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize Description The maximum amount of memory that the rhn-search service can use. Tune when Client count increases significantly, and OutOfMemoryException errors appear in journalctl -u rhn-search. Value default 512 MiB Value recommendation 512-4096 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example rhn-search.java.maxmemory = 4096 After changing Check memory usage. Description The amount of memory reserved for PostgreSQL shared buffers, which contain caches of database tables and index data. Tune when RAM changes Value default 25% of total RAM Value recommendation 25-40% of total RAM Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example shared_buffers = 8192MB After changing Check memory usage. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation Depends on other settings, use /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/susemanager-connection-check to obtain a recommendation. Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Setting this value to very high values could cause opposite effect as the workers will compete to each other for the CPU resources and the performance could be dropped significantly. Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master could be a sign of too low or too high value of this parameter. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-32, depending on the number of the CPU cores available for the server, it is recommended to keep the value slightly less than the number of CPU cores. Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 16 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. It makes sense to monitor the salt-master stats event by enabling master_stats and adjusting master_stats_event_iter to fine tune the value of this parameter. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description Determines whether the master will fire authentication events. Authentication events are fired when a minion performs an authentication check with the master. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of salt/auth events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example auth_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#auth-events Description Determines whether the master will fire minion data cache events (minion/refresh/*). Minion data cache events are fired when a minion requests a minion data cache refresh. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of minion/refresh/* events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example minion_data_cache_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#minion-data-cache-events Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Description Determines whether the salt-broker service should wait for backend sockets to be connected before opening the sockets for listening for connections from salt-minions. When enabled, it helps to prevent collecting ZeroMQ messages with the internal buffers of the sockets and pushing them to the salt-master once connection is restored. Tune when Unstable connectivity between the Uyuni Proxy and the Uyuni Server. Value default False Value recommendation True Location /etc/salt/broker Example wait_for_backend: True More information Proxies Connectivity Description The tcp keepalive interval to set on TCP ports. This setting can be used to tune Salt connectivity issues in messy network environments with misbehaving firewalls. Tune when Unstable connectivity between managed clients and the Uyuni Proxy or the Uyuni Server. Value default True Value recommendation True Location /etc/venv-salt-minon/minion.d/tuning.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning.conf, depending on the minion type. Example tcp_keepalive: True After changing Check Minions Connectivity for more details to fine tune extra keepalive parameters. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/minion.html#tcp-keepalive, Minions Connectivity Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Public Cloud Guide For more information on cloud products and support, see SUSE Public Cloud Guide. Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images SUSE publishes and servers that are part of the SUSE operated update infrastructure. PINT is available at pint.suse.com and provided as an API and command-line tool with the python3-susepubliccloudinfo package from the Public Cloud Module repository. To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command supportconfig. The command-line tool is provided by the package supportutils which is installed by default. Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate supportconfig plug-ins. When supportconfig is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. supportconfig plug-ins are stored in directory /usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/. The following procedure shows how to create a supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly. Procedure: Creating a supportconfig Archive Run supportconfig as root. Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list: Listing 1. Options: -E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E) Company name (-O) Your name (-N) Your phone number (-P) -i KEYWORDS, -F Limits the features to check. The placeholder KEYWORDS is a comma-separated list of case-sensitive keywords. Get a list of all keywords with supportconfig -F. Wait for the tool to complete the operation. The default archive location is /var/log, with the file name format being scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz To open a new support case for your cloud Pay-as-you-go instance, you need to generate a supportconfig file and then follow the steps listed on: SUSE Customer Center Cloudsupport This service serves billing data from Uyuni for the CSP-billing-adapter.

Enable and Configure the HANA Formula 2. Enable and Configure the Cluster Formula Uyuni uses formulas with forms to configure your SAP clients. There are two formulas that you need to use: Hana to configure the HANA database Cluster to configure the clients into a cluster The formulas are provided by packages that you can download with your package manager. You need to install the formulas on the Uyuni Server. When you have installed the package, you can use the Uyuni Web UI to enable and configure the formulas. As you go through the formula configuration process, provide details of the clients that contain your SAP cluster, to set them up appropriately. To install the formulas on the Uyuni Server, use your package manager to install these packages: saphanabootstrap-formula sapnwbootstrap-formula drbd-formula habootstrap-formula salt-shaptools The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important. You must enable, configure, and apply the HANA formula first. Then you can enable, configure, and apply the cluster formula. If you perform these steps in the wrong order, your SAP installation fails. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and click the client to use as the primary client in the cluster. Navigate to the Formulas tab, locate the Sap Hana Deployment heading, and check the Saphanabootstrap formula in the list. Click Save and apply the highstate to activate the formula. When the formula is activated, navigate to the Formulas Hana tab, and complete the details in the form. Make sure you check Install required packages to install everything you need on the client. In the Nodes sections, type the short hostname of the client to install the HANA database or the hostname you can retrieve on the command line with: salt '' grains.item host Provide further details for the installation. Complete the remaining details according to your environment, click Save, and apply the highstate. When the highstate is complete, you can go on to apply the cluster formula.

Register Clients to the SUSE Customer Center 2. Configure the Clients for Clustering 3. Create a Shared Storage Device 4. Download the SAP Installation Software 5. Configure Clients to Use Latest module.run 6. Install Additional Disks for HANA 7. Register Clients to the Server Your SAP cluster requires several client systems. Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP4/html/SLES-SAP-installation/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 一般的な要件. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. In the Activation Key field, select the SLES for SAP activation key.

Now you can use the Web UI to prepare software channels and activation keys for your clients. On the Uyuni Server, add the appropriate SAP channels: From the Web UI, add SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP. Synchronize the Uyuni Server with the SUSE Customer Center. You can do this using the Web UI. Add the new channel to your activation key. To check if a channel has finished synchronizing navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and select the Products tab. This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. Software channels can be very large. The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours. When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.

Salt Targets 2. Salt Execution Modules 3. Salt Function Arguments Salt commands have three main components: target, function, and arguments. The calls are constructed in this format: salt 'target' [arguments] The target defines the client, or group of clients, on which to run the function. The function is the particular task to be run. Arguments provide any extra data required by the function. Salt command targets allow you to specify a client or group of clients. There are several different targets you can use. General Targeting List available grains on all clients: salt '*' grains.ls Target a specific client: salt 'web1.example.com' test.ping Glob Targeting Target all clients using a particular domain: salt '*example.com' test.ping Target all clients using a particular label: salt 'label*' test.ping List Targeting Specify a flat list of clients, using their IDs: salt -L 'client_ID1, client_ID2, client_ID3' test.ping Regular Expression Targeting You can also define targets with PCRE-compliant regular expressions: salt -E '(?!web)' test.ping IP Address Targeting List available client IP addresses: salt '*' network.ip_addrs Target a specific client IP address: salt -S '172.31.60.74' test.ping Target all clients on a subnet: salt -S 172.31.0.0/16 test.ping For more on targeting, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/targeting/.

Proxies Connectivity Depending on the size and spreadness of the environment where Uyuni is used some connectivity issues are possible. There are no common recommendations for all the possible use cases as the environments could be very different expecially if public clouds instances are involved. In case clients are losing the connection to the Uyuni Server (or Uyuni Proxy if involved), they are unreachable from the Uyuni Server Web UI or with command line tools. To understand such a connection issue check if the client is not reachable from the Uyuni Server with salt MINION_ID test.ping, while venv-salt-call test.ping (or salt-call test.ping if non-bundle Salt is used on the client) is working fine on the client side. If this is the case, it is recommended to set tcp_keepalive parameters. The parameters with the values from the example below can be used as a starting point to look for settings, which could prevent cases of connection loss without restoring for some environments. It is recommended to put the parameters in the separate drop-in configuration file like /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf, depending on the minion type used on the client side. Listing 1. Example: Keepalive Parameters Example Values ###### Keepalive settings ###### ############################################ # ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by # the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through # a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is # the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion # without informing either party that their connection has been taken away. # Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening. # Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False) # or leave to the OS defaults (-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled. tcp_keepalive: True # How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300 # to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (-1) is typically 7200 seconds # on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time. tcp_keepalive_idle: 10 # How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default -1 # to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes. tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3 # How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default -1 to # use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see # /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl. tcp_keepalive_intvl: 10 salt-broker service is used on Uyuni Proxies to forward Salt traffic between the Uyuni Server and salt-minion service used on the client side. It is possible that salt-broker and all the clients behind it could be affected with the same issue as the clients directly connected to the Uyuni Server. The issue could be fixed with the same parameters as recommended for the minions, but specified in /etc/salt/broker on each Uyuni Proxy. Uyuni Proxy connectivity can also suffer when the connectivity to the Uyuni Server is lost for a quite long interval. In such a case Proxy connected clients started to retry the authentication to the salt-master service on the Uyuni Server. This situation could be potentially dangerous because it could lead to collecting large amount of ZeroMQ messages with authentication attemps in the interal buffer of ZeroMQ sockets used inside the salt-broker service. Then, on restoring the connection to the salt-master all of the pending messages will be pushed to it. It could lead to the issues on Uyuni Server side with salt-master service, because it could be impossible to serve all the cached requests in appropriate time or even to the complete denial of the service. To avoid such situation a set of tuning parameters is available. As the most important one, wait_for_backend should be set to True. This prevents opening the sockets for the clients behind the proxy while the connectivity to the salt-master service is not established. In this case the messages from the clients are not collected in the internal buffers. drop_after_retries is setting the number of retries before closing the sockets to drop the cached messages. The other parameters could help to fine tune the behavior for the environment. Setting timeouts, intervals and drop_after_retries to lower values are making salt-broker service more aggressive on detecting the connection loss to the salt-master, so that it puts the clients behind the proxy to the conditions closer as they are connected directly to the Uyuni Server. Increasing the values could provide some benefits in case if the network channel between the Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni Server is not stable enough, the message buffering can provide some flexibility while re-establishing the connection. Listing 2. Example: Values for Keepalive Parameters ###### ZeroMQ connection options ###### ############################################ # For more details about the following parameters check ZeroMQ documentation: # http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-setsockopt # All of these parameters will be set to the backend sockets # (from the salt-broker to the salt-master) # connect_timeout (sets ZMQ_CONNECT_TIMEOUT) # default: 0 # value unit: milliseconds # Sets how long to wait before timing-out a connect to the remote socket. # 0 could take much time, so it could be better to set to more strict value # for particular environment depending on the network conditions. # The value equal to 10000 is setting 10 seconds connect timeout. connect_timeout: 3000 # reconnect_ivl (sets ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL) # default: 100 # value unit: milliseconds # Sets the interval of time before reconnection attempt on connection drop. reconnect_ivl: 1000 # heartbeat_ivl (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL) # default: 0 # value unit: milliseconds # This parameter is important for detection of loosing the connection. # In case of value equal to 0 it is not sending heartbits. # It's better to set to more relevant value for the particular environment, # depending on possible network issues. # The value equal to 20000 (20 seconds) works good for most cases. heartbeat_ivl: 5000 # heartbeat_timeout (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT) # default: 0 # value unit: milliseconds # Sets the interval of time to consider that the connection is timed out # after sending the heartbeat and not getting the response on it. # The value equal to 60000 (1 minute) is considering the connection is down # after 1 minute of no response to the heartbeat. heartbeat_timeout: 10000 ###### Other connection options ###### # The following parameters are not related to ZeroMQ, # but the internal parameters of the salt-broker. # drop_after_retries # default: -1 # value unit: number of retries # Drop the frontend sockets of the salt-broker in case if it reaches # the number of retries to reconnect to the backend socket. # -1 means not drop the frontend sockets # It's better to choose more relevant value for the particular environment. # 10 can be a good choise for most of the cases. drop_after_retries: 5 # wait_for_backend # default: False # The main aim of this parameter is to prevent collecting the messages # with the open frontend socket and prevent pushing them on connecting # the backend socket to prevent large number of messages to be pushed # at once to salt-master. # It's better to set it to True if there is significant numer of minions # behind the salt-broker. wait_for_backend: True","title":"Salt Connectivity","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-connectivity","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-connectivity.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state. If you want to reference file templates in this configuration channel, ensure your file starts by specifying the source of the managed file, using this syntax: file.managed: - source: salt:////etc// Example custom state files are given later in this section. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. Procedure: Adding Additional Files to a Custom State Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. . Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit .sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2. Example: Package Management my_pkg_id: pkg.installed: - refresh: True - pkgs: - glibc - kernel-default - hello: 1.0-42 Listing 3. Example: Remote Command ip_forward-on: cmd.run: - name: echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - onlyif: - test `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 Listing 4. Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all user public files must be saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey- deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls. This short example maps the test state to the system group 12: # /srv/salt/top.sls base: 'group_ids:12': - match: pillar - test","title":"Custom Salt States","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-custom-states","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-custom-states.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This section describes how Salt is supported and set up as part of Uyuni Server. The main configuration file is /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf. Do not edit the /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf configuration file. This file belongs to the spacewalk-setup package and is marked as %config. When SUSE updates the spacewalk-setup package, the susemanager.conf file is overwritten, and any customization is lost. Instead, add your own configuration file to the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This prevents the update process from deleting your settings from the main susemanager.conf configuration file. Some settings from /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf that can help with finding configuration options: # Configure different file roots.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of Saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders. In the Configured Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.com). In the Type field, select master. Click Add item to add a second zone, and set these parameters for Zone 2: In the Name field, use the reverse zone for the configured IP range (for example: com.example.branch1).

Set Up a Branch Server Networking 1.1. Set Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN 1.2. Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network 2. Set up Branch Server Terminal Naming The Branch Network formula is used to configure the networking services required by the branch server, including DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP. The formula is used only for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3. with Uyuni Server 5.0. Do not use this formula if you want to connect Uyuni Proxy 5.0. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration it is required to fill at least Branch Identification. This identifies Branch Server in Retail subsystem and is also used to better organize terminals with their respective branch servers.

Saltboot Kernel Command Line Parameters The PXE formula is used to configure PXE booting on the branch server. The formula is used only for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3. with Uyuni Server 5.0. Do not use this formula if you want to connect Uyuni Proxy 5.0. Procedure: Configuring PXE Booting In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Pxe formula, and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Pxe tab, and set these parameters: In the Kernel Filename field, keep the default value. In the Initrd Filename field, keep the default value. If the terminals connecting to this branch server are running arm64 architecture, check the Enable ARM64 UEFI boot box. Leave unchecked for x86-64. In the Kernel Filename for ARM64 field, keep the default value. In the Initrd Filename for ARM64 field, keep the default value. In the Kernel Command Line Parameters field, keep the default value.

Click Save Formula to save your configuration. Apply the highstate. Saltboot supports common kernel parameters and Saltboot-specific kernel parameters. All the parameters can be entered in the Kernel Command Line Parameters field of the PXE formula. kiwidebug=1 Starts a shell on tty2 during boot and enables debug logging in Salt. Do not use this parameter in a production environment as it creates a major security hole. This parameter should be used only in a development environment for debug purposes. MASTER Overrides auto-detection of the Salt master. For example: MASTER=myproxy.domain.com SALT_TIMEOUT Overrides the local boot fallback timeout if the Salt master does not apply the Saltboot state within this timeout (default: 60 seconds). For example: SALT_TIMEOUT=300 DISABLE_HOSTNAME_ID If the terminal has a hostname assigned by DHCP, it is by default used as a minion ID. Setting this option to 1 disables this mechanism, and SMBios information will be used as a minion ID. DISABLE_UNIQUE_SUFFIX Setting this option to 1 disables adding random generated suffix to terminal minion ID. If you set this parameter make sure your terminal has either a unique hostname provided by DHCP and DNS, or the terminal hardware comes with a unique serial number stored in its SMBios memory. Otherwise there is a risk of terminal minion ID duplicity, and bootstrapping the minion will fail. The following parameters (MINION_ID_PREFIX, salt_device, root) are usually autoconfigured and should be used only in specific conditions such as debugging or development: MINION_ID_PREFIX Branch ID set in the Branch Network formula form. salt_device Device that contains the Salt configuration. root Device that contains the already deployed root file system.

Expression language 3. Writing Salt Formulas 4. Separate Data 5. Generated Pillar Data This section contains information about writing custom formulas, including formulas with forms. You can write your own custom formulas, and make them available to client systems in the Uyuni Web UI. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directory also contains an optional metadata.yml file with additional information about the formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt// Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata// All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata//form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a : null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py The process is executed like this: The suma_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (suma_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Getting the statistics based on the events published in the Salt event bus can help to identify possible weak points and perform Salt internals profiling. Saline is a powerful tool designed to function as a Prometheus exporter, enabling the collection of metrics based on events from the Salt event bus. These metrics are derived from event data available on the Salt master, similar to what is accessible through the command: mgrctl exec -ti -- salt-run state.event Saline is distributed as a separate container image, server-saline, for use with Uyuni Server. All related commands and operations should be executed on the Uyuni Server container host system. In addition to its role as a Prometheus exporter, Saline also provides the saline-formula, which simplifies configuration of Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, enhancing monitoring and visualization capabilities. To deploy Saline on the Uyuni Server use mgradm upgrade podman with --saline-replicas 1. Saline can be deployed during the installation of the Uyuni Server using mgradm install podman with --saline-replicas 1. The only possible values for --saline-replicas are 1 or 0. The default port 8216 can be changed with specifying --saline-port NNNN (where NNNN is a desired port number) on calling mgradm upgrade podman. After finishing the deployment uyuni-server-saline@0.service should be configured on the Uyuni Server host system. It is recommended to add master_stats: True and adjust the value of master_stats_event_iter: 60 if needed. Then restart salt-master to get the detailed statistics of internal Salt calls. This can be help with tuning large scale deployment installations. To configure Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, see Saline Formula. To remove Saline from the Uyuni Server use mgradm upgrade podman with --saline-replicas 0. The dashboard represents Salt events with the different views presented on the panels.

Batching 2. Disabling the Salt Mine Salt is able to run commands in parallel on a large number of clients. This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C.","title":"Salt Rate Limiting","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-rate-limiting","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-rate-limiting.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://suma-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the suma-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost suma-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to suma-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:suma-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to suma-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file= minion state.apply certs,` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time. The SSH key is used on salt-ssh managed systems. Additionally, it is used on Uyuni Proxies for the user mgrsshtunnel. Normal systems managed with the Salt default method are not affected and do not have this key configured. Procedure: Rotating SSH keys On the Uyuni Server, as user root, change to user salt: su -s /bin/bash - salt Create a new SSH key: ssh-keygen -N \"\" -t rsa -q -f /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id Copy the public key into the Salt filesystem to make it usable in a Salt state: cp /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id.pub /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ Change back to user root again: exit Rollout the new key to all systems that need it. Applying the util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key state will limit the changes to salt-ssh managed systems and proxies: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key Move the old key away and make the new key the standard key. Rename mgr_ssh_id key to disabled_mgr_ssh_id and new_mgr_ssh_id key to mgr_ssh_id in the SSH keystore of the user salt as well as in the Salt filesystem for the public keys: su -s /bin/bash - salt cd .ssh mv mgr_ssh_id disabled_mgr_ssh_id mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id mgr_ssh_id mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub cd /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub OPTIONAL: When containerized proxies exist, re-create the configuration to get the new SSH key into the proxy configuration. Restart the containers with the new configuration. It is also possible to change the existing configuration on the podman host (ssh.yaml). Change the value of server_ssh_key_pub with the content of the current mgr_ssh_id.pub. To remove the disabled keys from the authorized_keys` files of the [literal]salt-ssh`` managed systems and the proxies, apply the state a second time: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Download Endpoint States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see カスタムシステム情報. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. If you change pillar data on the server (Salt master) the actual pillar data on the client (minion) is updated only after calling saltutil.refresh_pillar for the client. Otherwise it could happen that pillar.items and pillar.get calls would produce different results with different values of pillars that were not refreshed. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring. When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor. To use beacons on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Salt clients, install the python-pyinotify package. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, install the python-inotify package. For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are sometimes referred to as Salt clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step.

General Salt timeouts 2. Presence Ping Timeouts 3. Salt SSH Clients (SSH Push) Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (presence_ping_timeout/presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here.

Install the Yomi Formula 2. Install the PXE Image 3. Register Yomi in Cobbler 4. Example Salt Pillar Preparation 5. Monitor the Installation Yomi (yet one more installer) is an installer for SUSE and openSUSE operating systems. Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp:///pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Initial Preparation on the Legacy Server 2.2. SSH Connection Preparation 2.3. 移行の実行 2.3.1. Migration of the Certificates 3. Kubernetes Preparations 4. 移行 To migrate a legacy Uyuni Server (RPM installation) to a container, a new machine is required. An in-place migration is not possible. The migration procedure currently does not include any hostname renaming functionality. The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the new server will remain identical to that on the old server. After the migration, it will be necessary to manually update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. Self trusted GPG keys are not migrated. GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated. Thus synchronizing channels with spacewalk-repo-sync can fail. The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the previous Uyuni installation to the container host after the actual server migration. Procedure: Manual Migration of the GPG Keys to New Server Copy the keys from the previous Uyuni server to the container host of the new server. Later, add each key to the migrated server with the command mgradm gpg add . The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the old server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration the processes on the old server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping the services on the old server. For example: mgradm migrate podman --prepare Procedure: Initial Preparation on the Legacy Server Uyuniサービスを停止します。 spacewalk-service stop PostgreSQLサービスを停止します。 systemctl stop postgresql プロシージャ: SSH接続を準備する Ensure that for root an SSH key exists on the new 2024.12 server. If a key does not exist, create it with: ssh-keygen -t rsa The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server host for a connection to the legacy server that does not prompt for a password. eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add To establish a connection without prompting for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server. If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add followed by the path to the private key. You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. Copy the public SSH key to the legacy Uyuni Server () with ssh-copy-id. Replace with the FQDN of the legacy server: ssh-copy-id The SSH key will be copied into the legacy server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. For more information, see the ssh-copy-id manpage. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the legacy Uyuni Server to check that no password is needed. Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint. In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Then try again. The fingerprint will be stored in the local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. When planning your migration from a legacy Uyuni to a containerized Uyuni, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the old setup. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth. プロシージャ: 移行を実行する This step is optional. If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-server tool. 詳細については、mgr-storage-server --helpを参照してください。このツールを使用すると、コンテナストレージとデータベースボリュームの作成が容易になります。 このコマンドは次のように使用します。 mgr-storage-server [] 例: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 このコマンドは、/var/lib/containers/storage/volumesに永続ストレージを作成します。 詳細については、Persistent Container Volumesを参照してください。 Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server. Replace with the FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman 信頼されているSSL CA証明書を移行します。 Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on a legacy Uyuni in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the legacy installation after migration: Procedure: Migrating the Certificates Copy the file from the legacy server to the new server. たとえば、/local/ca.fileです。 次のコマンドを使用してファイルをコンテナにコピーします。 mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the old legacy server. To redirect them to the 2024.12 server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as legacy server. Before executing the migration with mgradm migrate command, it is essential to predefine Persistent Volumes, especially considering that the migration job initiates the container from scratch. For more information, see the installation section for comprehensive guidance on preparing these volumes in Persistent Container Volumes. Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server, replacing with the appropriate FQDN of the old server: mgradm migrate podman または mgradm migrate kubernetes After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the old server. To redirect them to the new server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as the old server.","title":"Legacy Uyuni Server Migration to Container","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"migrate-uyuni-to-a-container","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/migrate-uyuni-to-a-container.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Start the Uyuni 2024.12 Proxy This guide outlines the deployment process for the Uyuni 2024.12 Proxy. This guide presumes you have already successfully deployed a Uyuni 2024.12 Server. To successfully deploy, you will perform the following actions: Checklist: Proxy Deployment Review hardware requirements. Install openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 on a bare-metal machine. Bootstrap the Proxy as a Salt minion. Generate a Proxy configuration. Transfer the Proxy configuration from Server to Proxy Use the Proxy configuration to register the Salt minion as a Proxy with Uyuni. Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host The supported operating system for the container host is openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. Container host A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. This table shows the hardware requirements for deploying Uyuni Proxy. Table 1. Proxy Hardware Requirements Hardware Details Recommendation CPU x86-64, ARM Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores RAM Minimum 2 GB Recommended 8 GB Disk Space / (root directory) Minimum 40 GB /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Minimum 100 GB, Storage requirements should be calculated for the number of ISO distribution images, containers, and bootstrap repositories you will use. For general requirements, see General requirements. An openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 server should be installed from installation media. This procedure is described below. For CPU, RAM, and storage requirements, see Hardware requirements. To guarantee that clients can resolve the FQDN domain name, both the containerized server and the host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 On your local host open a terminal window or start up a virtual machine running openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. Login. Enter the transactional-update shell: transactional-update shell Add the following repository to your openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 server: zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Proxy-POOL-$(arch)-Media1/ uyuni-proxy-stable Refresh the repository list and accept the key: zypper ref Install the container tools: zypper in mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion uyuni-storage-setup-proxy Alternatively you may install mgrpxy-zsh-completion or mgrpxy-fish-completion. Exit the transactional shell: transactional update # exit Reboot the host. For more information on the Uyuni Container Utilities, see Uyuni Container Utilities. This step is optional. However, if custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-proxy tool. For more information, see mgr-storage-proxy --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and Squid cache volumes. Use the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-proxy For example: mgr-storage-proxy /dev/nvme1n1 This command will create the persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes 「ディスクがいっぱいになったコンテナ」イベントのトラブルシューティング Task: Bootstrap the Proxy Host Select Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the fields for your Proxy host. Select the Activation key created in the previous step from the dropdown. Click + Bootstrap. Wait for the Bootstrap process to complete successfully. Check the Salt menu and confirm the Salt minion key is listed and accepted. Reboot the Proxy host. Select the host from the System list and trigger a second reboot after all events are finished to conclude the onboarding. Task: Update the Proxy Host Select the host from the Systems list and apply all patches to update it. Reboot the Proxy host. The configuration archive of the Uyuni Proxy is generated by the Uyuni Server. Each additional Proxy requires its own configuration archive. The container host for the Uyuni Proxy must be registered as a salt minion to the Uyuni Server prior to generating this Proxy configuration. You will perform the following tasks: Generate a Proxy configuration file. Transfer the configuration to the Proxy. Start the Proxy with the mgrpxy command. Task: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration using Web UI In the Web UI, navigate to Systems Proxy Configuration and fill the required data: In the Proxy FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy. In the Parent FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the Uyuni Server or another Uyuni Proxy. In the Proxy SSH port field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on Uyuni Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022. In the Max Squid cache size [MB] field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Typically this should be at most 60% of available storage for the containers. In the SSL certificate selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for Uyuni Proxy or an existing one should be used. You can consider generated certificates as Uyuni builtin (self signed) certificates. Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate. The CA certificates generated on the server are stored in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/ssl-build directory. For more information about existing or custom certificates and the concept of corporate and intermediate certificates, see SSL証明書のインポート. Click Generate to register new proxy FQDN in Uyuni Server and generate configuration archive with details for container host. After a few moments you are presented with file to download.

Optional: Synchronizing Products from SUSE Customer Center This quick start guide shows you how to install and configure a Uyuni 2024.12 container for x86-64 architecture on openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. This table shows the software and hardware requirements for deploying Uyuni Server. Table 1. Bare metal Host Software and Hardware Requirements Software and Hardware Recommended Operating System: openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5: CPU: Minimum 4 dedicated 64-bit x86-64CPU cores RAM: Development server Minimum 16 GB Production server Minimum 32 GB Disk Space: Disk space depends on your channel requirements, at least 100 GB 50 GB per SUSE or openSUSE product and 360 GB per Red Hat product Swap space: 3 GB Official operating system for the Server Container Host The supported operating system for the container host is openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. Container host A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully. An FQDN typically follows the format ..com. For instance: uyuni.example.com uyuni.fritz.box uyuni.container.lab For additional details, refer to the section on network requirements in the Installation and Upgrade Guide, available at ネットワーク要件. Proceed to: Download openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 Select and download the Offline Image. Prepare a USB fash disk or DVD for installation. Insert a DVD or a bootable USB stick containing the installation image for openSUSE Leap. Boot or reboot your system. For detailed documentation on preparing your machines OS (virtual or physical), see SLE Micro 5.5 Deployment Guide. Procedure: openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 Installation Use the arrow keys to select Installation. On the Language, Keyboard and license Agreement page click Next. On the NTP Configuration page click Next. On the Authentication for the System page enter a password for the root user. Click Next. On the Installation Settings page click Install. Login at the prompt as root. Run transactional-update: transactional-update Reboot the system. Login as root. Enter the transactional shell: transactional-update shell Add the continer utility repository: zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-$(arch)-Media1/ uyuni-server-stable Refresh the repository list and accept the key: zypper ref Install the container tools: zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion uyuni-storage-setup-server Reboot the host. Uyuni is deployed as a container using the mgradm tool. There are two methods of deploying a Uyuni server as a container. In this section we will focus on basic container deployment. For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy see, Configuration and deployment with mgradm and a custom yaml file. For additional information, you can explore further by running mgradm --help from the command line. Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman From the terminal run the following command as root. mgradm install podman Input a password for the CA certificate, an administrative account password and your email for notifications: leapmicro:~ # mgradm install podman 3:07PM INF Welcome to mgradm 3:07PM INF Executing command: podman Password for the CA certificate to generate: Administrator password: Administrator's email: admin@example.com The container will take some minutes to deploy. Once complete open a browser and visit https://leapmicro.uyuni.lab to begin working with Uyuni. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This table lists architecture, channels, and status information. If your SUSE Linux Enterprise client is based on x86_64 architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products to start product synchronization. When a channel is added, Uyuni will schedule the channel for synchronization. Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time. You can monitor synchronization progress in the Web UI. For more information about using the setup wizard, see Wizard. When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients.

Uyuni Proxy This guide shows you the fastest way to get Uyuni up and running in a public cloud using on-demand or BYOS services. We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring-your-own-subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server or proxy. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in パブリッククラウドの要件. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Server. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete the setup in the Uyuni Web UI. You must use the BYOS method. Start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launch a Uyuni Proxy instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Proxy BYOS images by searching for suse manager proxy. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in パブリッククラウドの要件. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Proxy. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using SUSE setup tools. When you have completed Uyuni Proxy setup, you need to activate the public cloud module.","title":"Initial Setup","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"setup","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/byos/setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

I no longer require support; how can I end the Uyuni PAYG subscription? Last updated: October 2023 BYOS Bring-your-own-subscription Uyuni deployments are supported on the cloud, however, billing will not be via the cloud marketplace. Once the existing subscription term ends, you can purchase Uyuni PAYG via the cloud provider marketplace and manage your instances with a Uyuni deployment that is billed via the cloud. Yes, the listing works independently from your existing BYOS Uyuni subscriptions. Please remember that support processes may be different for deployments using your existing BYOS subscription and those billed via the cloud and note that there is currently no process for migrating deployments between BYOS and PAYG versions. When purchasing Uyuni via the AWS & Azure Marketplaces, the billing is as follows: Billing is monthly and handled via cloud marketplace. Managed instances are recorded hourly. The peak usage total is recorded for the month. There is a monthly usage charge for each instance in the count. SLES for SAP Applications PAYG/on-demand instances, when purchased via the cloud marketplace, include Lifecycle Management(LCM) entitlements for Uyuni. The Uyuni PAYG billing engine recognizes the embedded LCM entitlements and does not include them in the count. This means there are no additional charges to manage these with the Uyuni PAYG listing. However, if Uyuni Monitoring is required for these instances, additional charges will apply for this feature. If using the Uyuni PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace, billing will commence from the time of deployment and when applicable client instances are on-boarded to Uyuni. There is the Uyuni BYOS listing in the cloud marketplace that can be used, a trial subscription key can be obtained via the SUSE Website. This deployment cannot be directly converted to allow billing via cloud marketplaces. To benefit from monthly billing via the cloud marketplace, Uyuni needs to be redeployed using the version from the PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace. Billing is based on the number of managed instances. Below are 3 examples of how the node count is calculated, check the table below for the detail. Static usage Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management, for 1 month with no additional managed clients added in the month. Bursting Model Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management for 3 weeks in the month, bursting to 30 managed instances for 1 week. Transient model A temporary deployment of Uyuni with 20 managed instances, for 2 weeks (336 hours) The total is calculated by counting number of active nodes (checked hourly). There is a monthly charge for each managed node under management in the billing cycle. Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated. Table 1. Usage calculations for different scenarios Managed Instances Peak Usage Billed for Static Usage 10 10 10 Bursting Model 10 - 3 Weeks, 30 - 1 Week 30 30 Transient Cluster 20 - 2 Weeks 20 20 It is dependent on the deployment and the cloud provider, as every Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has its own commercial terms and offers. It may be possible to secure special commercial terms such as an annual subscription. For example, AWS can offer Uyuni PAYG via a Private Offer. Please contact SUSE for more information. There are such programs at the cloud providers: Azure MACC Program AWS Enterprise Discount Program Google CUD Yes, it can. Please contact your cloud provider sales team for more details. Once Uyuni PAYG has been deployed from the marketplace listing and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase to manage additional instances. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of instances Uyuni is managing. Just on-board additional instances to Uyuni as needed, this will be reflected in your cloud marketplace bill. By default, the Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is ongoing for as long as Uyuni is deployed and instances are registered. Currently, there is no volume discount available. If you no longer require support, there are 2 options: Unregister all systems from the Uyuni Server Terminate the Uyuni instance.","title":"Billing - General","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-billing-general","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-billing-general.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

What client Operating Systems are supported with Uyuni PAYG? Currently, it is not possible to migrate an existing instance to the PAYG version. Customers can simply deploy a new Uyuni PAYG instance from the cloud marketplace and re-onboard all instances using the standard process. Client configuration overview It is simple to open a support case with SUSE for Uyuni PAYG. Create a ‘supportconfig’ via Uyuni PAYG instance CLI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) at the following link: https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport Providing marketplace billing is active, a support case will be opened. The Uyuni PAYG product available in the cloud marketplace is the same product, with similar functionality that you would run on-premises or with a manual installation. The only exceptions being the ability to bill via the cloud marketplace and connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure for Uyuni product updates. It is also worth checking the list of supported client operating systems to ensure your needs are met. It is recommended that the Uyuni instance always remains active. Uyuni PAYG, when deployed via the cloud marketplace will automatically connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure, no separate Uyuni subscription key is required. Updates to the Uyuni instance can be applied from those channels using standard SUSE tooling (i.e. zypper). Yes, Uyuni Hub is recommended for customers with more than 10,000 managed clients. If the Uyuni Hub instance has no connected clients, there will be no charge for the Uyuni Hub software components. Billing will occur from the downstream Uyuni PAYG Server instance, where managed instances are connected. To manage BYOS instances, SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Yes, it is possible to manage instances, in the cloud, on premises or both. To enable management of SUSE workloads in an on-premises data center, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider's network. With a hybrid landscape, egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider. To reduce these costs, SUSE recommend the use of the containerized proxy. Please note: Whilst the SUSE Manger Proxy usage is included as part of the Uyuni PAYG subscription, an LCM+ subscription will be billed if the proxy is also a managed workload, so in other words it counted as a managed client. No, to benefit from cloud marketplace billing, the Uyuni PAYG instance must reside on the cloud. Any Uyuni instances on premises will require their own subscriptions. Please refer to the product documentation for a full list of supported clients.

Last updated: October 2023 No, all components needed to handle the billing are part of the Uyuni PAYG code base. The cloud marketplace listing for Uyuni PAYG will deploy a Uyuni instance, together with the embedded billing engine. The cloud marketplace listing for Uyuni PAYG is tied to a specific version of Uyuni (4.3.8 at launch). Future listings will typically include the latest version available at the time of product/image creation. Please check the listing for further information. No, there is no choice over the Uyuni version when deploying using the cloud marketplace listing. If a prior version of Uyuni is required, this will need to be installed manually using the standard documentation and BYOS billing. The Marketplace listing is tied to a specific version of Uyuni, which is the latest version available at the time of the listing. Typically, the listing in the cloud marketplace is updated quarterly, or more frequently if there are security issues. It is worth noting that the image update process may not be fully aligned to the Uyuni product maintenance releases (every 6-8 weeks), so Uyuni PAYG instances should be patched regularly after deployment. Yes, the billing mechanism for the products is independent. Each deployment will be billed separately via the cloud marketplace. Existing deployments cannot be directly converted or updated to provide billing via the cloud marketplace.

Last updated: October 2023 By selecting the Uyuni PAYG listing from the cloud marketplace, customers can deploy Uyuni to their cloud environment with the advantage of having monthly billing via the cloud provider. Customers still have the option of using Uyuni BYOS (Bring-your-own-subscription), for which subscriptions and billing is handled directly by SUSE. The listings can be found in the AWS & Azure Marketplaces. There are two listings: On the AWS Marketplace, you will find the following: Uyuni Server Family (Non-EU and non-UK only) Uyuni Server Family (EU and UK only) On the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, you will find: Uyuni with 24x7 Support Uyuni with 24x7 Support (EMEA Orders Only) For the purposes of this FAQ, we will refer to these listings as Uyuni PAYG. We have 2 listings for Uyuni: EU and UK only / EMEA Orders Only non-EU and non-UK only. You should pick the listing that reflects in which country your AWS & Azure account gets billed. The Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is not available to purchase in all countries. In case it is not available in your country you can still use the BYOS option. Your billing country is based on the AWS & Azure Account ID used to do the deployment. You can find out more about confirming your tax location as follows: For Amazon Web Services, it depends on the tax address of the account, see Tax help based on location For Microsoft Azure, it depends on the sold to address of the account, see Azure account profile Please see the link at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact Uyuni PAYG via the cloud marketplaces. If your cloud provider account is billed to one of the allowed countries, it is possible to deploy Uyuni in any region. It is not possible to transact/bill Uyuni PAYG via AWS & Azure Marketplaces in China. It is possible to deploy into regions in China. This means you can deploy Uyuni in a region in China if your billing is performed in a country that has the PAYG option available. Please see the addendum at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact Uyuni PAYG via the cloud. Yes, for customers that wish to use an existing annual Uyuni subscription, the BYOS Uyuni listing is available. If a Uyuni Proxy is required as part of the architecture, it is suggested to use the containerized proxy. See the SUSE documentation at: documentation.suse.com Select Uyuni Uyuni {2024.12} Installation and Upgrade guide Installation Uyuni Proxy Install Containerized Proxy From the subscription point of view, Uyuni Proxy is a managed client. There is no need to subscribe twice. Subscribing to the listing in the cloud provider marketplace allow the Uyuni PAYG instance to perform metered billing for Uyuni usage. If you onboard an instance and enable Uyuni monitoring, there is a monthly charge for management and another charge for monitoring.","title":"Public Cloud Listings","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-listings","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-listings.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure Uyuni Instance This section covers initial preparation and configuration of the image on AWS. To ensure seamless operation, proper AWS permissions for the IAM (Identity and Access Management) role are essential. This role must be attached to the instance, otherwise disconnection errors will be thrown after one hour. You can pre-create the role on your AWS account and then select it from the existing IAM role drop-down during the instance configuration process. If you create the role during the creation of an instance, the role will not be attached automatically. The role should be added post setup. A role can be assigned to a running instance through the following steps: Actions Security Modify IAM-role. It needs to have the following policy attached in order to be used: { \"AttachedPolicies\": [ { \"PolicyName\": \"AWSMarketplaceMeteringFullAccess\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMarketplaceMeteringFullAccess\" } ] } To allow the EC2 service to assume such role: \"AssumeRolePolicyDocument\": { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] } IAM role can be attached to an EC2 instance by means of an instance profile, which acts as a container for the role itself. For detailed information on IAM roles, see: docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM Procedure: Configuring your Uyuni instance Select the AMI image and provide a meaningful name for your server. Review the details and pricing information provided. You have the option to configure additional instance details in subsequent steps, such as storage, tags, security groups, and the required IAM role. The image automatically suggests a default CPU configuration. Choose an existing key pair or create a new one to grant access to the instance. Your organization should provide the necessary security groups and network configuration. If an IAM role has been previously created, you can attach it by selecting it from the existing IAM role drop-down. Otherwise, attach this role after the instance has been launched. Create the following partitions 100 GB for the root partition 500 GB for spacewalk storage 80 GB for the database.

This action links your Uyuni PAYG instance with additional PAYG products on Microsoft Azure. Bootstrapping or client registration is the process of onboarding clients in Uyuni. The registration process installs the appropriate client tools and provides full management functionality. To manage your clients, start by establishing connections and then proceed to bootstrap your clients. These two actions are the steps required for initiating and completing the client onboarding process. Procedure: Connecting SUSE Linux Enterprise PAYG Instances to Uyuni PAYG Return to the Uyuni Server Web UI. Navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Pay-as-you-go and click the +Add Pay-as-you-go button. Add a description. Complete the instance SSH connection data: Host: CSP URL of the machine SSH Port: 22 User: root Password: SSH Private Key Click Create and wait for the sync to finish. Proceed to Admin Setup Wizard Products to access your PAYG SUSE Linux Enterprise products. Now that you have established connections to the Uyuni PAYG instance you can register them as clients. To learn how to register various clients see: Client Registration Methods Inbound and outbound connections to Microsoft Azure are released after 4 minutes of being idle. This affects minion connectivity, especially when your Uyuni server is in Microsoft Azure and you have some on-premises minions. If a connection is idle for more than 4 minutes, connectivity is lost. To resolve this issue on your minions: Procedure: Create a new configuration file at i.a. /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/keepalive.conf and enable keepalive: tcp_keepalive: True tcp_keepalive_intvl: 5 tcp_keepalive_idle: 10 tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3 Restart the venv-salt-minion service.","title":"PAYG Client connections and Client Registration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"payg-azure-connections-and-bootstrapping","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/payg/azure/payg-azure-connections-and-bootstrapping.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Network Configuration 2. Configure Storage Procedure: Log in and Update the System SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system. sudo -i zypper refresh zypper update For Uyuni PAYG setup it is required, that a new Virtual Network and a new subnet is configured. It is impossible to setup the instance in an existing network. When you setup new clients which should be managed, take care that you put them into the private subnet which is configured with Uyuni PAYG. If you want to manage systems in an already existing network, you must configure peering. Procedure: Network Configuration Ensure the network configuration aligns such that hostname -f yields the identical name as the reverse DNS lookup of the private IP address. For instance, when executing nslookup 10.0.0.X. Insert the private IP with its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into /etc/hosts. For example: 10.0.0.4 instancename.internal.cloudapp.net Edit /etc/sysconfig/network/config and append internal.cloudapp.net to NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST. Execute netconfig update. Subsequently, hostname -f should return the same FQDN as obtained from nslookup 10.0.0.X. When adding new virtual machines (VMs), such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5, it is crucial to ensure that they are configured within the same subnet as the Uyuni instance. This step is essential for successful network setup and integration. Additionally, be mindful of the geographical restrictions associated with your plans. Make sure to utilize the appropriate Azure accounts which correspond to the specific geographic zones of your project. SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system. sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Configure storage with the mgr-storage-server tool or in the case of the proxy use mgr-storage-proxy. For more information, see mgr-storage-server --help or mgr-storage-proxy --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes. Format the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-server [] #For example: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 This command will create the following persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes: For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes.
