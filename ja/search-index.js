© 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled{ldquo}GNU Free Documentation License{rdquo}. If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the “ with…​Texts.” line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

9. データベース接続情報 Uyuniのインストールを定期的にバックアップして、データの損失を防ぎます。 Uyuniは、インストールされているプログラムと設定だけでなくデータベースにも依存しているため、インストールのすべてのコンポーネントをバックアップすることが重要です。 この章には、バックアップする必要のあるファイルに関する情報が含まれており、データベースバックアップを管理するためのsmdbaツールについて説明しています。 また、システム障害が発生した場合のバックアップからの復元に関する情報も含まれています。 使用するバックアップ方法にかかわらず、現在のインストールで使用している容量の3 倍以上の空き容量が必要です。 容量が不足するとバックアップが失敗する可能性があるため、頻繁に確認してください。 Uyuniのインストールをバックアップする最も包括的な方法は、関連するファイルとディレクトリをバックアップすることです。 これにより、バックアップの管理にかかる時間を節約でき、障害発生時に再インストールと再同期をより速く実行できます。 ただし、この方法ではディスク領域がかなり必要になるため、バックアップの実行に時間がかかることがあります。 必要なファイルとディレクトリのみをバックアップする場合は、次のリストを使用します。 このプロセスをよりシンプルで包括的なものにするには、ここで指定したディレクトリだけでなく/etcと/rootディレクトリ全体をバックアップすることをお勧めします。 一部のファイルは、関連するSUSE Manager機能を実際に使用している場合にのみ存在します。 /etc/cobbler/ /etc/dhcp.conf /etc/fstabおよび必要なISOマウントポイント。 UUIDが変更されている場合は、それに応じて、fstabエントリを更新していることを確認します。 /etc/rhn/ /etc/salt /etc/sudoers /etc/sysconfig/rhn/ /root/.gnupg/ /root/.ssh このファイルはSSHトンネルまたはSSH pushを使用している場合に存在します。 またid-susemanagerキーのコピーを保存しておく必要があります。 /root/ssl-build/ /srv/formula_metadata /srv/pillar /srv/salt /srv/susemanager /srv/tftpboot/ /srv/www/cobbler /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ /srv/www/os-images /var/cache/rhn /var/cache/salt /var/lib/cobbler/ /var/lib/cobbler/templates/ (バージョン4.0より前は/var/lib/rhn/kickstarts/です) /var/lib/Kiwi /var/lib/rhn/ /var/run/pgsql/ /var/lib/salt/ /var/run/salt/ /var/spacewalk/ スクリプト、KickstartまたはAutoYaSTプロファイル、カスタムRPMなどのカスタムデータを含むディレクトリ。 データベースをバックアップする必要もあります。バックアップはsmdbaツールで実行できます。 プロシージャ: 手動バックアップからの復元 Uyuniサーバを再インストールします。 詳細については、Uyuni 2023.1サーバのインストールを参照してください。 Uyuniサーバをyast2 susemanager_setupを使用して設定します。 詳細については、SUSE Managerのサーバ設定を参照してください。 Uyuni Web UIを使用するか、コマンドプロンプトでmgr-syncツールを使用して、Uyuniリポジトリを再同期します。 製品を再登録するか、登録およびSSL証明書生成セクションをスキップするかを選択できます。 /root/ssl-build/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-MACHINE_NAME-VER-REL.noarch.rpmパッケージを再インストールします。 次回rhn-searchサービスを開始するときに検索インデックスの再作成をスケジュールします。 このコマンドはデバッグメッセージのみを生成し、エラーメッセージは生成しません。 rhn-search cleanindex /var/spacewalk/packages/を復元する必要があるかどうかを確認します。 /var/spacewalk/packages/がバックアップになかった場合は、復元する必要があります。 ソースリポジトリが使用できる場合は、完全なチャンネル同期を使用して/var/spacewalk/packages/を復元できます。 mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels ローカルPostgreSQLデータベースを管理するには、smdbaツールを使用します。 データベースのバックアップと復元、およびバックアップの管理を行うことができます。 また、データベースのステータスを確認したり、再起動などの管理タスクを実行したりするために使用できます。 smdbaツールの詳細については、[reference:cli-smdba]を参照してください。 smdbaツールは、ローカルPostgreSQLデータベースでのみ動作し、リモートアクセスされたデータベースやOracleデータベースでは動作しません。 smdbaツールにはシステムの変更を実行するためにsudoアクセスが必要です。 開始する前に次の行の/etc/sudoersファイルをチェックして、adminユーザに対してsudoアクセスを有効にしていることを確認してください。 admin ALL=(postgres) /usr/bin/smdba 次のコマンドを使用して、データベースのランタイムステータスを確認します。 smdba db-status このコマンドは、次のように、onlineまたはofflineを返します。 Checking database core... online データベースの起動と停止は次のコマンドを使用して実行できます。 smdba db-start および smdba db-stop smdbaツールは継続的なアーカイブバックアップを実行します。 このバックアップ方法では、現在のセッション中にデータベースに行われたすべての変更のログと、一連の従来のバックアップファイルが結合されます。 クラッシュが発生した場合は、最初にディスク上の最新のバックアップファイルからデータベースの状態が復元され、次に現在のセッションのログが正確に再生されて、データベースが現在の状態に戻されます。 データベースを実行している状態でsmdbaを使用した継続的なアーカイブバックアップが実行されるため、ダウンタイムは必要ありません。 このバックアップ方法は安定していて、通常は整合性のあるスナップショットを作成しますが、多くのストレージ容量を占有する可能性があります。 バックアップに使用できる現在のデータベースサイズの3倍以上の容量があることを確認します。 /var/lib/pgsql/に移動し、df -hを実行することで、現在のデータベースサイズを確認できます。 また、smdbaツールは、アーカイブを管理し、最新のバックアップと、ログの現在のアーカイブのみを保持します。 ログファイルの最大ファイルサイズはわずか16MBであるため、ファイルがこのサイズに達すると新しいログファイルが作成されます。 新しいバックアップを作成するたびに、以前のバックアップがパージされてディスク領域が解放されます。 cronを使用してsmdbaのバックアップをスケジュールし、ストレージが効果的に管理されるようにして、障害が発生した場合に備えて常にバックアップを準備しておくことをお勧めします。 smdbaツールはコマンドラインから直接実行できます 。 インストール直後、または設定に重大な変更を加えた場合は、データベースの手動バックアップを実行することをお勧めします。 smdbaが初めて実行される場合、またはバックアップの場所を変更した場合は、アーカイブを実行する前にデータベースを再起動する必要があります。 この結果、わずかなダウンタイムが発生します。 通常のデータベースバックアップでは、ダウンタイムは必要ありません。 プロシージャ: データベースの手動バックアップの実行 バックアップ用の永続的なストレージ容量を割り当てます。 この例では、/var/spacewalk/にあるディレクトリを使用しています。 これはバックアップの永続的なターゲットになるため、常にサーバからアクセスできるようにしてください。 バックアップの場所で、バックアップのディレクトリを作成します。 rootとして: install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup バックアップの場所に適切な許可が設定されていることを確認します。 chown postgres:postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup 最初に、バックアップを作成するには、 enableオプションセットを指定して、smdba backup-hotコマンドを実行します。 これにより、指定されたディレクトリにバックアップが作成されます。必要に応じて、データベースを再起動します。 smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup このコマンドはデバッグメッセージを生成し、次の出力で正常に終了します。 INFO: Finished バックアップファイルが/var/spacewalk/db-backupディレクトリに存在することを確認し、バックアップが成功したことを確認してください。 smdbaを使用してデータベースバックアップを実行するためにシステムをシャットダウンする必要はありません。 ただし、大規模な操作であるため、バックアップの実行中にデータベースのパフォーマンスが低下する可能性があります。 中断を最小限に抑えるために、定期的なデータベースバックアップを低トラフィック期間にスケジュールすることをお勧めします。 バックアップに使用できる現在のデータベースサイズの3倍以上の容量があることを確認します。 /var/lib/pgsql/に移動し、df -hを実行することで、現在のデータベースサイズを確認できます。 プロシージャ: 自動バックアップのスケジュール バックアップのディレクトリを作成し、適切な許可を(rootとして)設定します。 install -m 700 -o postgres -g postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup /etc/cron.d/db-backup-mgrを開くか、存在しない場合は作成し、次の行を追加して、cronジョブを作成します。 0 2 * * * root /usr/bin/smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup バックアップディレクトリを定期的に確認し、バックアップが期待通りに機能していることを確認します。 smdbaツールを使用すると、障害が発生した場合にはバックアップから復元できます。 プロシージャ: バックアップからの復元 データベースをシャットダウンします。 smdba db-stop 復元プロセスを開始して、完了するまで待機します。 smdba backup-restore start データベースを再起動します。 smdba db-start RPMとデータベース間に違いがあるかどうかを確認します。 spacewalk-data-fsck アーカイブログを使用すると、データベース管理ツールsmdbaでホットバックアップを実行できます。 Uyuniに埋め込みデータベースがある場合、デフォルトでアーカイブログは有効になっています。 PostgreSQLは限られた数のアーカイブ ログを維持します。 デフォルト設定を使用すると、サイズが16MiBの約64個のファイルが保存されます。 ユーザを作成し、チャンネルを同期します。 SLES12-SP2-Pool-x86_64 SLES12-SP2-Updates-x86_64 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool-x86_64-SP2 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates-x86_64-SP2 PostgreSQLは、追加で約1GBのデータを生成します。 したがって、バックアップ戦略について考え、定期的にバックアップを作成することが重要です。 アーカイブログは/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog/ (postgresql)に保存されます。 データベース管理者は、サブコマンドspace-overviewを使用して、占有されていたテーブルスペースに関するレポートを取得します。例: smdba space-overview 出力: SUSE Manager Database Control.

プロジェクトにパッチを含める 指定した日付以降にリリースされたすべてのパッチはBy Date（日付別）フィルタによって除外されます。 このフィルタは、月次パッチサイクルに従うコンテンツライフサイクルプロジェクトに役立ちます。 プロシージャ: By Date（日付別）フィルタの作成 Uyuni Web UIで、 コンテンツライフサイクル フィルタに移動して、Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックします。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドに、フィルタの名前を入力します。 たとえば、Exclude patches by date（日付別にパッチを除外する）。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Patch (Issue date)］（パッチ(発行日)）を選択します。 ［ マッチャー］フィールドでは、［later or equal］（それ以降）が自動選択されます。 日時を選択します。 保存をクリックします。 プロシージャ: プロジェクトへのフィルタの追加 Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、リストからプロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しリンクをクリックして、すべての使用可能なフィルタを表示します 新しい［ Exclude patches by date］（日付別にパッチを除外する）を選択します。 保存をクリックします。 新しいフィルタがフィルタリストに追加されますが、プロジェクトに適用する必要があります。 フィルタを適用するには、最初の環境を構築する必要があります。 プロシージャ: フィルタの使用 ビルドをクリックして、最初の環境を構築します。 オプション: メッセージを追加します。 メッセージを使用して、ビルド履歴を追跡できます。 テストサーバで新しいチャンネルを使用して、フィルタが正しく機能していることを確認します。 Promote（プロモート）をクリックして、次の環境にコンテンツを移動します。 多数のフィルタがある場合、または非常に複雑な場合は、ビルドに時間がかかります。 テストは、問題を発見するのに役立つ場合があります。 問題が見つかった場合は、by

フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックして、［Include kernel security patch］（カーネルセキュリティパッチを含める）を選択します。 保存をクリックします。 ビルドをクリックして、環境を再構築します。 月次パッチサイクルが完了すると、次の月のパッチサイクルを更新できます。 プロシージャ: 月次パッチサイクルの更新 ［by date］（日付別）フィールドで、フィルタの日付を次の月に変更します。 または、新しいフィルタを作成して、プロジェクトへの割り当てを変更します。 SUSE-15-2019-1807の除外フィルタをプロジェクトから取り外すことができるかどうか確認します。 この問題を解決するために使用できる新しいパッチがある場合があります。 以前に追加した［許可］フィルタを取り外します。 パッチはデフォルトで含まれています。 プロジェクトを再構築して、来月のパッチを適用した新しい環境を作成します。 このセクションでは、ライブパッチ処理用の環境を作成するためのフィルタの設定について説明します。 ライブパッチ処理を使用する準備をしている場合には、いくつかの重要な考慮事項があります システムでカーネルバージョンを1つだけ使用してください。 ライブパッチ処理パッケージは、特定のカーネルとともにインストールされます。 ライブパッチ処理の更新は、1つのパッチとして出荷されます。 新しいシリーズのライブパッチ処理カーネルを開始するカーネルパッチごとに、要再起動フラグが表示されます。 これらのカーネルパッチには、ライブパッチ処理ツールが付属しています。 それらをインストールしたら、翌年になる前に少なくとも1回システムを再起動する必要があります。 インストール済みカーネルバージョンに一致するライブパッチ更新のみをインストールします。 ライブパッチは、スタンドアロンパッチとして提供されます。 現在インストールされているカーネルバージョンよりも新しいカーネルバージョンの通常のカーネルパッチをすべて除外する必要があります。 この例では、SUSE-15-2019-1244パッチでシステムを更新します。 このパッチには、kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64が含まれています。 より新しいバージョンのkernel-defaultを含むすべてのパッチを除外する必要があります。 プロシージャ: より新しいカーネルバージョンのパッケージを除外する Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル フィルタに移動して、Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックします。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドに、フィルタの名前を入力します。 たとえば、Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1（4.12.14-150.17.1より新しいカーネルを除外する）。 ［フィルタタイプフィールドで、［Patch

［リリース］フィールドに、「 150.17.1」と入力します。 保存をクリックして、フィルタを保存します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックします。 ［Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1］（4.12.14-150.17.1より新しいカーネルを除外する）を選択して、保存をクリックします。 ビルドをクリックすると、新しい環境が作成されます。 新しい環境には、インストールしたバージョンまでのすべてのカーネルパッチが含まれています。 より新しいカーネルバージョンのすべてのカーネルパッチは削除されます。 ライブパッチ処理カーネルは、シリーズの最初でない限り、引き続き使用できます。 このプロシージャはフィルタテンプレートを使用して自動化できます。 ライブパッチ処理フィルタテンプレートの適用方法の詳細については、administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templatesを参照してください。 特定のカーネルバージョン用のライブパッチ処理は、1年間のみ利用できます。 1年後、システムのカーネルを更新する必要があります。 以下の環境変更を実行します。 プロシージャ: 新しいカーネルバージョンに切り替える アップグレードするカーネルバージョンを決定します。 例: 4.12.14-150.32.1 新しいカーネルバージョンフィルタを作成します。 以前のフィルタ ［Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1］（4.12.14-150.17.1より新しいカーネルを除外する）を取り外し、新しいフィルタを割り当てます。 ビルドをクリックして、環境を再構築します。 新しい環境には、選択した新しいカーネルバージョンまでのすべてのカーネルパッチが含まれています。 これらのチャンネルを使用しているシステムには、インストールに使用できるカーネル更新があります。 アップグレードを実行した後で、システムを再起動する必要があります。 新しいカーネルは1年間有効です。 その年にインストールされたすべてのパッケージは、現在のライブパッチ処理カーネルフィルタと一致します。 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8クライアントを使用している場合は、Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStreamリポジトリなどのモジュラーリポジトリから直接インストールやアップグレードなどのパッケージ操作を実行できません。 AppStreamフィルタを使用して、モジュラーリポジトリを通常のリポジトリに変換できます。 これはパッケージをリポジトリに保持し、モジュールのメタデータを削除することにより行われます 。 その結果作成されたリポジトリは、通常のリポジトリと同じ方法でUyuniで使用できます。 AppStreamフィルタはターゲットリポジトリに含める単一のモジュールストリームを選択します。 複数のフィルタを追加して、複数のモジュールストリームを選択できます。 CLMプロジェクトでAppStreamフィルタを使用しない場合は、モジュラーソースのモジュールメタデータは未加工のままで、ターゲットリポジトリには同じモジュールメタデータが含まれます。 CLMプロジェクトで少なくとも1つのAppStreamフィルタが有効になっている限り、すべてのターゲットリポジトリが通常のリポジトリに変換されます。 場合によっては、どのモジュールのパッケージも含めずに通常のリポジトリを構築したい場合があります。 これを行うには、マッチャー なし (モジュール化を無効にする)を使用して AppStreamフィルタを追加します。 これにより、ターゲットリポジトリ内のすべてのモジュールが無効になります。 これは、ほとんどのモジュールのデフォルトバージョンが通常のパッケージとしてAppStreamリポジトリにすでに含まれている、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9のクライアントに特に役立ちます。 AppStreamフィルタを使用するには、Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStreamなどのモジュラーリポジトリを含むCLMプロジェクトが必要です。 開始する前に、必要なモジュールがソースとして含まれていることを確認してください。 プロシージャ: AppStreamフィルタの使用 Uyuni Web UIで、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLMプロジェクトに移動します。 プロジェクトにAppStreamチャンネルが含まれていることを確認します。 Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックし、次のパラメータを使用します。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドには、新しいフィルタの名前を入力します。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Module (Stream)］（モジュール(ストリーム)）を選択します。 ［ マッチャー］フィールドで、［等しい］を選択します。 ［モジュール名］フィールドに、モジュール名を入力します。 たとえば、postgresql。 ［ストリーム］フィールドに、目的のストリームの名前を入力します。 たとえば、10。 このフィールドを空のままにする場合、モジュールのデフォルトのストリームが選択されます。 保存をクリックして、新しいフィルタを作成します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックし、新しいAppStreamフィルタを選択して、保存をクリックします。 ［Create/Edit Filter］（フィルタの作成/編集）フォームのブラウズ機能を使用して、モジュラーチャンネルで使用可能なモジュールストリームのリストからモジュールを選択できます。 プロシージャ: 使用可能なモジュールストリームのブラウズ Uyuni Web UIで、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLMプロジェクトに移動します。 プロジェクトにAppStreamチャンネルが含まれていることを確認します。 Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックし、次のパラメータを使用します。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドには、新しいフィルタの名前を入力します。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Module (Stream)］（モジュール(ストリーム)）を選択します。 ［ マッチャー］フィールドで、［等しい］を選択します。 ［Browse available modules］（使用可能なモジュールをブラウズ）をクリックして、すべてのモジュラーチャンネルを表示します。 モジュールとストリームをブラウズするチャンネルを選択します。 ［モジュール名］フィールドで、検索するモジュール名の入力を開始するか、リストから選択します。 ［ストリーム］フィールドで、検索するストリーム名の入力を開始するか、リストから選択します。 チャンネル選択はモジュールのブラウズのみを目的としています。 選択したチャンネルはフィルタとともに保存されず、CLMプロセスには影響しません。 ターゲットリポジトリに含める他のモジュールストリーム用に追加のAppStreamフィルタを作成できます。 選択したストリームが依存するモジュールストリームは自動的に含まれます。 競合する、互換性のない、または欠落しているモジュールストリームを指定しないように注意してください。 たとえば、同じモジュールから2つのストリームを選択すると無効になります。 プロシージャ: モジュール化の無効化 Uyuni Web UIで、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 CLMプロジェクトに移動します。 プロジェクトにAppStreamチャンネルが含まれていることを確認します。 Create Filter（フィルタの作成）をクリックし、次のパラメータを使用します。 ［フィルタ名］フィールドには、新しいフィルタの名前を入力します。 ［フィルタタイプ］フィールドで、［Module (Stream)］（モジュール(ストリーム)）を選択します。 ［マッチャー］フィールドで、［なし (モジュール化を無効にする)］を選択します。 保存をクリックして、新しいフィルタを作成します。 コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動して、プロジェクトを選択します。 フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックし、新しいAppStreamフィルタを選択して、保存をクリックします。 これにより、モジュールに属するパッケージを除いて、モジュールのメタデータがターゲットリポジトリから効率的に削除されます。 Web UIのビルドボタンを使用してCLMプロジェクトを構築する場合、ターゲットリポジトリは、選択したモジュールストリームからのパッケージを含む、モジュールを含まない通常のリポジトリです。 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8のプロジェクトでモジュール化を完全に無効にすると、一部のモジュールが Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8での正常な動作に不可欠であるため、環境に不具合が生じる可能性があります。","title":"コンテンツライフサイクル管理の例","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

これは、限られたメンテナンスウィンドウ中に更新を適用する必要がある場合に特に役立ちます。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理では、ソフトウェアチャンネルをソースとして選択し、必要に応じて環境に合わせて調整して、運用クライアントにインストールする前に徹底的にテストすることがでます。 ベンダチャンネルを直接変更することはできませんが、パッケージとカスタムパッチを追加または削除することで、それらのチャンネルのクローンを作成し、クローンを変更することができます。 これらのクローンチャンネルをテストクライアントに割り当てて、クライアントが期待どおりに動作することを確認できます。 デフォルトでは、クローンベンダチャンネルは元のベンダチャンネルと一致し、依存関係を自動的に選択します。 /etc/rhn/rhn.confに次のオプションを追加することにより、クローンチャンネルの自動選択を無効にできます。 java.cloned_channel_auto_selection = false 次に、すべてのテストに合格すると、クローンチャンネルを運用サーバにプロモートできます。 これは、ソフトウェアチャンネルがライフサイクルで移動できる一連の環境を通じて実現されます。 ほとんどの環境ライフサイクルには、少なくともテスト環境と運用環境が含まれていますが、必要な数の環境を持つことができます。 このセクションでは、基本的なコンテンツライフサイクル手順、および使用可能なフィルタについて説明します。 より具体的な例については、コンテンツライフサイクル管理の例を参照してください。 コンテンツライフサイクルを設定するには、プロジェクトから開始する必要があります。

パッケージの依存は、コンテンツのフィルタリング中には解決されません。 フィルタで使用できるマッチャーは複数あります。 使用できるマッチャーは、選択したフィルタ タイプによって異なります。 使用できるマッチャーは次のとおりです。 含む 一致（正規表現の形式を取る必要があります） 等しい 新しい 新しいか等しい 古いか等しい 古い 新しいか等しい 各フィルタには許可または拒否のいずれかに設定できるruleパラメータがあります。 フィルタは次のように処理されます。 パッケージまたはパッチが拒否フィルタを満たす場合は、結果から除外されます。 パッケージまたはパッチが許可フィルタを満たす場合は、結果に含まれます(拒否フィルタによって除外された場合でも）。 この動作は、一般的な 拒否 フィルタを使用して多数のパッケージまたはパッチを除外し、特定の 許可 フィルタで特定のパッケージまたはパッチを「チェリーピック」する場合に役立ちます。 コンテンツフィルタは組織内でグローバルなものであり、プロジェクト間で共有できます。 プロジェクトにすでに構築されたソースが含まれている場合、環境を追加すると、既存のコンテンツが自動的に入力されます。 コンテンツは、サイクルの以前の環境から引き出されます(存在していた場合)。 以前の環境がない場合は、プロジェクトソースが再度構築されるまで空のままになります。 いくつかの一般的なシナリオでフィルタの作成を支援するため、Uyuniにはフィルタテンプレートが用意されています。 これらのテンプレートを適用すると、特定のユースケースに合わせてカスタマイズされた一連のフィルタを事前に作成できます。 このセクションでは、使用可能なテンプレートとその使用方法について説明します。 ライブパッチ処理を含むプロジェクトでは、ライブパッチパッケージのみがクライアントに更新として提供されるように、定期的な将来のカーネルパッケージを除外する必要があります。 一方で、システムの整合性を維持するために、すでにインストールされている通常のカーネルパッケージを含める必要があります。 このテンプレートを適用すると、この動作を実現するために必要な3つのフィルタが作成されます。 ベースカーネルバージョンと同じkernel-defaultパッケージを含むパッチを許可する reboot_suggestedキーワードを含むパッチを拒否する installhint(reboot-needed)という名前を提供するパッケージを含むパッチを拒否する

指定したプレフィクスを持つフィルタを3つ選択し、保存をクリックします。 プロジェクトに含まれているモジュラーリポジトリですべてのモジュールを使用できるようにする場合は、このフィルタテンプレートを使用してモジュールを自動的に追加できます。 このテンプレートを適用すると、モジュールごとにAppStreamフィルタとそのデフォルトストリームが作成されます。 このプロセスがプロジェクトのページから実行された場合、フィルタは自動的にプロジェクトに追加されます。追加されない場合は、作成されたフィルタをコンテンツライフサイクル フィルタに一覧表示し、必要に応じて任意のプロジェクトに追加できます。 個々のフィルタを編集して別のモジュールストリームを選択したり、ターゲットリポジトリからそのモジュールを除外するために完全に削除したりできます。 すべてのモジュールストリームが相互に互換性がある訳ではないため、個々のストリームを変更すると、モジュール間依存関係を正常に解決できない可能性があります。 この場合、プロジェクトの詳細ページのフィルタペインに問題を説明するエラーが表示され、すべてのモジュールの選択が互換性を持つようになるまでビルドボタンは無効になります。 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9以降、モジュールには定義済みのデフォルトストリームがありません。 したがって、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9のソースでこのテンプレートを使用しても効果はありません。 AppStreamリポジトリをコンテンツライフサイクル管理で設定する方法の詳細については、administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filtersを参照してください。 プロシージャ: テンプレートの適用 UyuniのWeb UIで、Content Lifecycle Projectsに移動し、プロジェクトを選択します。 ［フィルタ］セクションで、フィルタの割り当て／取り外しをクリックし、新しいフィルタの作成をクリックします。 ダイアログで、テンプレートを使用するをクリックします。 それに応じて入力が変更されます。 ［プレフィクス］フィールドに、名前のプレフィクスを入力します。 この値はテンプレートによって作成されたすべてのフィルタの名前の前に追加されます。 テンプレートがプロジェクトのコンテキストで適用されている場合は、このフィールドにはプロジェクトラベルが事前に入力されます。 ［テンプレート］フィールドで、［デフォルトのAppStreamモジュール］を選択します。 ［チャンネル］フィールドで、モジュールを取得するモジュラーチャンネルを選択します。このドロップダウンには、モジュラーチャンネルのみが表示されます。 保存をクリックして、フィルタを作成します。 ［フィルタ］セクションまでスクロールして、新しく割り当てられたAppStreamフィルタを確認します。 個々のフィルタを編集/削除して、ニーズに合わせてプロジェクトを調整できます。 プロジェクトを作成し、環境を定義し、ソースとフィルタを割り当てたら、初めてプロジェクトを構築できます。 構築によって、割り当てられたソースにフィルタが適用され、プロジェクトの最初の環境にそれらが複製されます。 複数のコンテンツプロジェクトのソースとして同じベンダチャンネルを使用できます。 この場合、Uyuniはクローンチャンネルごとに新しいパッチクローンを作成しません。 代わりに、1つのパッチクローンがすべてのクローンチャンネル間で共有されます。 これにより、パッチが撤回された場合やパッチ内のパッケージが変更された場合など、ベンダがパッチを変更すると問題が発生する可能性があります。 コンテンツプロジェクトの1つを構築すると、コンテンツプロジェクトの他の環境や組織内の他のコンテンツプロジェクトチャンネルにチャンネルがある場合でも、クローンパッチを共有するすべてのチャンネルがデフォルトでオリジナルと同期されます。 この動作は、組織の設定で自動パッチ同期をオフにすることで変更できます。 パッチを共有しているすべてのチャンネルのパッチを後で手動で同期するには、ソフトウェア 管理 チャンネルに移動し、同期するチャンネルをクリックして、［同期］サブタブに移動します。 パッチを手動で同期しても、パッチを共有するすべての組織チャンネルに影響します。 プロシージャ: コンテンツライフサイクルプロジェクトの構築 Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動し、構築するプロジェクトを選択します。 プロジェクトを構築する前に、利用可能な環境があることを確認してください。 割り当てられたソースとフィルタを確認し、ビルドをクリックします。 このビルドの変更または更新を説明するバージョンメッセージを提供します。 ［ 環境ライフサイクル ］セクションでビルドの進行状況を監視できます。 ビルドが完了すると、環境バージョンが1つ増え、ソフトウェアチャンネルなどのビルドソースをクライアントに割り当てることができます。 プロジェクトが構築されると、構築されたソースを順次、環境にプロモートできます。 プロシージャ: 環境のプロモート Uyuni Web UIで、コンテンツライフサイクル プロジェクトに移動し、作業するプロジェクトを選択します。

7および互換システムでは、scap-security-guideパッケージが提供されています。このパッケージには、古い内容が含まれています。 Uyuniクライアントツールにあるscap-security-guide-redhatパッケージを使用することをお勧めします。 SUSEは、異なるOpenSCAPプロファイル用の scap-security-guideパッケージを提供しています。 scap-security-guideの現在のバージョンでは、SUSEは次のプロファイルをサポートしています。 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12および15のDISA STIGプロファイル SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12および15のPCI-DSSプロファイル SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12および15のHIPAAプロファイル CISプロファイルなどの他のプロファイルは、コミュニティが提供するものであり、SUSEによって公式にサポートされていません。 SUSE以外のオペレーティングシステムの場合、含まれるプロファイルはコミュニティが提供します。 これらはSUSEによって公式にサポートされていません。 OpenSCAPは、SCAPコンテンツファイルを使用してテストルールを定義します。 これらのコンテンツファイルは、XCCDFまたはOVAL標準に基づいて作成されます。 『SCAPセキュリティガイド』に加えて、公開されているコンテンツファイルをダウンロードして、要件に合わせてカスタマイズできます。 デフォルトのコンテンツファイルテンプレート用のSCAPセキュリティガイドパッケージをインストールできます。 または、XCCDFまたはOVALに精通している場合は、独自のコンテンツファイルを作成できます。 テンプレートを使用してSCAPコンテンツファイルを作成することをお勧めします。 独自のカスタムコンテンツファイルを作成して使用する場合は、自己責任で作成してください。 カスタムコンテンツファイルを使用してシステムが破損した場合、SUSEのサポートを受けられない可能性があります。 コンテンツファイルを作成したら、ファイルをクライアントに転送する必要があります。 これは、物理的なストレージメディアを使用して他のファイルを移動するのと同じ方法で行うことができます。または、Salt (たとえば、salt-cpやSalt File Server)、ftpやscpを使用してネットワークを介して移動することもできます。 Uyuniで管理しているクライアントにコンテンツファイルを配布するパッケージを作成することをお勧めします。 パッケージの整合性を確認するために、パッケージに署名して検証することができます。 詳細については、カスタムチャンネルを参照してください。 オペレーティングシステムによって、使用可能なOpenSCAPコンテンツファイルとプロファイルが異なります。 1つのコンテンツファイルに複数のプロファイルを含めることができます。 RPMベースのオペレーティングシステムでは、次のコマンドを使用して、使用可能なSCAPファイルの場所を決定します。 rpm -ql DEBベースのオペレーティングシステムでは、次のコマンドを使用して、使用可能なSCAPファイルの場所を決定します。 dpkg -L ニーズに合う1つの

レポートの使用は、特に多数のシステムを管理している場合は、Uyuni Web UIから手動で情報を収集するより簡単な場合が多いです。 コマンドラインツールspacewalk-reportを使用して事前設定されたレポートを生成することができますが、Hub Reportingを導入することで、完全にカスタマイズされたレポートを生成することもできます。 これは、SQL言語をサポートする任意のレポーティングツールをレポーティングデータベースに接続し、データを直接抽出することで実現できます。 データの可用性と構造の詳細については、レポーティングデータベーススキーマのドキュメントを参照してください。 レポートを生成するには、spacewalk-reportsパッケージをインストールしている必要があります。 spacewalk-reportコマンドを使用すると、Uyuni全体のコンテンツ、システム、およびユーザリソースに関するレポートを整理して表示できます。 Hub Reportingの導入により、spacewalk-reportはデフォルトでレポーティングデータベースからデータを収集するようになりました。 詳細についてはspacewalk-reportおよびレポーティングデータベースを参照してください。 次に関するレポートを生成できます。 システムインベントリ: Uyuniに登録されているすべてのシステムを一覧にします。 パッチ: 登録されているシステムに関連するすべてのパッチを一覧にします。 重大度、および特定のパッチに適用されるシステムでパッチをソートできます。 ユーザ: すべての登録済みユーザおよび特定のユーザに関連するすべてのシステムを一覧にします。 CSV形式でレポートを取得するには、サーバのコマンドプロンプトで次のコマンドを実行します。 spacewalk-report spacewalk-reportは、デフォルトで新しいレポーティングデータベースを使用してデータを抽出します。 これは、新しく生成されたレポートには、データの構造と形式にいくつかの相違があることを意味します。 すべてのレポートに共通する相違点は次のとおりです。 レポートデータはリアルタイムでは変更されませんが、スケジュールされたタスクの実行によってのみ更新されます。 データの重複が削除され、以前は「多値」と見なされていた列には、;で区切られた複数の値が含まれるようになりました。 これはまた、コマンドラインオプション--multival-on-rowsと --multival-separatorが新しいレポートには適用されなくなったことも意味します。これは、これらの動作がデフォルトになったためです。 すべてのレポートで、新しい列のmgm_idとsynced_dateが導入され、ハブシナリオの管理サーバと、アプリケーションデータベースから情報が最後に更新された時刻を識別します。 すべてのブール値は、1/0値ではなく、True/Falseで表されるようになりました。 列org_idは、数値識別子ではなく組織名を含む、 organization に置き換えられました。 「サーバ」という用語は「システム」に置き換えられました。 したがって、たとえば、列server_id はsystem_idと呼ばれるようになりました。 レポート固有の変更については、使用可能なレポートのリストを参照してください。 この変更された動作によって問題が発生した場合、新しいオプション--legacy-reportを使用して、アプリケーションデータベースに対して実行される古いレポートにフォールバックできます。 hubレポートの詳細については、Hub Reporting を参照してください。 この表は、使用可能なレポートを一覧表示します。 Table 1. spacewalk-reportレポート レポート

SSLを使用してUyuniサーバに登録するすべてのクライアントは、サーバ証明書に対して検証することにより、適切なサーバに接続していることを確認します。 このプロセスはSSLハンドシェークと呼ばれます。 SSLハンドシェーク中に、クライアントはサーバ証明書のホスト名が予期しているホスト名と一致することを確認します。 クライアントは、サーバ証明書が信頼できるかどうかも確認する必要があります。 認証局(CA)は、他の証明書に署名するために使用される証明書です。 証明書が有効であると見なされ、クライアントが証明書と正常に照合できるようにするには、すべての証明書が認証局(CA)によって署名されている必要があります。 SSL認証が正しく機能するためには、クライアントがルートCAを信頼する必要があります。 これは、ルートCAがすべてのクライアントにインストールされる必要があることを意味します。 SSL認証のデフォルトの方法は、Uyuniで自己署名証明書を使用することです。 この場合、Uyuniはすべての証明書を生成し、ルートCAはサーバ証明書に直接署名しています。 別の方法は、中間CAを使用する方法です。 この場合、ルートCAは中間CAに署名します。 中間CAは任意の数の他の中間CAに署名することができ、最後のCAはサーバ証明書に署名します。 これはチェーン証明書と呼ばれます。 チェーン証明書で中間CAを使用している場合は、ルートCAがクライアントにインストールされ、サーバ証明書がサーバにインストールされます。 SSLハンドシェーク中に、クライアントはルートCAとサーバ証明書の間の中間証明書のチェーン全体を検証できる必要があります。そのため、クライアントはすべての中間証明書にアクセスできる必要があります。 これを実現するには、主に2つの方法があります。 以前のバージョンのUyuniでは、デフォルトですべての中間CAがクライアントにインストールされます。 ただし、サーバ上でサービスを設定してクライアントに提供することも可能です。 この場合、SSLハンドシェーク中に、サーバはサーバ証明書とすべての中間CAを提示します。 このメカニズムは現在、新しいデフォルト設定として使用されています。 デフォルトでは、Uyuniは中間CAなしの自己署名証明書を使用します。 セキュリティを強化するために、サードパーティのCAを手配して証明書に署名できます。 サードパーティのCAは、証明書に含まれる情報が正しいことを確認するためにチェックを実行します。 通常、このサービスには年会費がかかります。 サードパーティのCAを使用すると、証明書のスプーフィングが難しくなり、インストールに対する保護が強化されます。 サードパーティのCAによって署名された証明書がある場合は、Uyuniのインストール環境にインポートできます。 このマニュアルでは、SSL証明書の使用について2つのステップで説明します。 Uyuniツールを使用して自己署名証明書を作成する方法

アクティベーションキーのベストプラクティス アクティベーションキーは従来のクライアントとSaltクライアントで使用し、クライアントが正しいソフトウェアのエンタイトルメントを持ち、適切なチャンネルに接続して関連グループに加入するようします。 それぞれのアクティベーションキーは、キーを作成するときに設定できる組織にひもづけされます。 Uyuniでは、アクティベーションキーは、ラベルの付いた一連の設定です。 アクティベーションキーに関連付けられている設定は、すべて適用できます。そのためには、キーのラベルをパラメータにしてブートストラップスクリプトに追加します。 アクティベーションキーラベルをブートストラップスクリプトと組み合わせて使用することをお勧めします。 ブートストラップスクリプトが実行されると、そのラベルに関連付けられているすべての設定が、スクリプトを実行しているシステムに適用されます。 アクティベーションキーは以下を指定できます。 チャンネルの割り当て システムの種類またはアドオンのエンタイトルメント 接続メソッド 設定ファイル インストールするパッケージ システムグループの割り当て アクティベーションキーは、クライアント登録時に使用され、再使用されることはありません。 アクティベーションキーで指定する内容に関係なく、クライアントは登録後、任意の方法で変更できます。 アクティベーションキーとクライアントの関連付けは、履歴を残すためだけに記録されます。 プロシージャ: アクティベーションキーの作成 UyuniのWeb UIで、管理者としてシステム アクティベーションキーに移動します。 キーの作成ボタンをクリックします。 ［アクティベーションキーの詳細］ページの［説明］フィールドにアクティベーションキーの説明を入力します。 ［キー］フィールドにアクティベーションキーの名前を入力します。 たとえば、SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4ではSLES15-SP4と入力します。 SUSE製品の［キー］フィールドではカンマまたは二重引用符を使用しないでください。 ただし、Red Hat製品ではカンマを使用する必要があります。 他のすべての文字を使用できますが、<>(){}(スペースを含む)は自動的に削除されます。 フィールドが空のままの場合、ランダムな文字列が生成されます。 ［ベースチャンネル］ドロップダウンボックスで、適切なベースソフトウェアチャンネルを選択し、関連する子チャンネルへのデータ入力を許可します。 詳細については、reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc#vle.webui.admin.wizard.productsとカスタムチャンネルを参照してください。 必要な子チャンネルを選択します(必須のSUSE Managerツールや更新チャンネルなど)。 いずれかのオプションを有効にする必要がある場合は、［付属エンタイトルメント］チェックボックスにチェックを付けます。 ［接続メソッド］は［デフォルト］のままにすることをお勧めします。 ［汎用デフォルト］設定には、チェックを入れないようにすることをお勧めします。 アクティベーションキーの作成をクリックしてアクティベーションキーを作成します。 ［設定ファイルの展開］チェックボックスをチェックし、このキーの設定管理を有効にし、アクティベーションキーの更新をクリックしてこの変更を保存します。 ［設定ファイルの展開］チェックボックスは、アクティベーションキーを作成するまで表示されません。 設定管理を有効にする必要がある場合、前に戻ってボックスにチェックを付けます。 従来のクライアントでブートストラップスクリプトを実行するとき、アクティベーションキーを結合できます。 キーを結合すると、システムにインストールされる機能をより詳細に制御でき、大規模な環境や複雑な環境でのキーの重複が軽減されます。 アクティベーションキーの結合は、従来のクライアント上でのみ動作します。 Saltクライアントはアクティベーションキーの結合をサポートしていません。 Saltクライアントで結合キーを使用する場合、最初のキーのみ使用されます。 コマンドプロンプトまたはシングル自動インストールプロファイルで複数のアクティベーションキーを指定できます。 Uyuniサーバのコマンドプロンプトで、rhnreg_ksコマンドを使用し、カンマでキーの名前を区切ります。 Kickstartプロファイルで複数のキーを指定するには、システム 自動インストールに移動し、使用するプロファイルを編集します。 値が競合するとクライアントの登録に失敗するため、アクティベーションキーを結合するときには注意してください。 結合する前に次の値で情報の競合がないことを確認してください。 ソフトウェアパッケージ ソフトウェアの子チャンネル 設定チャンネル。 競合は、検出されると次のように処理されます。 ベースソフトウェアチャンネルの競合: 登録は失敗します。 システムの種類の競合: 登録は失敗します。 enable configuration フラグの競合: 設定管理が有効になります。 一方のキーがシステム固有のキーである場合: 登録は失敗します。 クライアントを再登録してすべてのUyuni設定を再取得するために、再アクティベーションキーを1回だけ使用できます。 再アクティベーションキーはクライアント固有で、システムID、履歴、グループ、およびチャンネルが含まれています。 再アクティベーションキーを作成するには、［システム］に移動し、再アクティベーションキーを作成するクライアントをクリックし、詳細 再アクティベーションタブに移動します。 新しいキーの生成をクリックして再アクティベーションキーを作成します。 後で使用できるようにキーの詳細を書き留めます。 特定のシステムIDに関連付けられていない通常のアクティベーションキーと異なり、ここで作成されるキーは、システム アクティベーションキーページに表示されません。 Saltクライアントの場合、再アクティベーションキーを作成した後、/etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.confのmanagement_key grainとして使用できます。次に例を示します。 grains: susemanager: management_key: \"re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e\" salt-minionプロセスを再起動して再アクティベーションキーを適用します。 ブートストラップスクリプトで再アクティベーションキーを使用できます。 ブートストラップスクリプトの詳細については、ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録するを参照してください。 従来のクライアントの場合、再アクティベーションキーを作成した後、rhnreg_ksコマンドラインユーティリティでこのキーを使用できます。 このコマンドを実行すると、クライアントが再登録され、そのUyuni設定が復元されます。 従来のクライアントでは、再アクティベーションキーをアクティベーションキーと結合して、単一システムプロファイルで複数のキーの設定を集約できます。 次に例を示します。 rhnreg_ks --server=/XMLRPC \\ --activationkey=, \\ --force 既存のUyuniプロファイルでクライアントを自動インストールすると、そのプロファイルは、再アクティベーションキーを使用して、システムを再登録し、その設定を復元します。 プロファイルベースの自動インストール実行中は、このキーを再生成、削除、または使用しないでください。 このような操作を実行すると、自動インストールは失敗します。 デフォルトの親チャンネル SUSEマネージャのデフォルトの親チャンネルを使用しないでください。 この設定では、Uyuniは、インストールされるオペレーティングシステムに最適な親チャンネルを強制的に選択します。その場合、予期しない動作が発生する可能性があります。 代わりに、それぞれのディストリビューションおよびアーキテクチャに固有のアクティベーションキーを作成することをお勧めします。 アクティベーションキーによるブートストラップ ブートストラップスクリプトを使用している場合、各スクリプトにアクティベーションキーを作成することを検討してください。 作成によって、チャンネルの割り当て、パッケージのインストール、システムグループメンバーシップ、および設定チャンネルの割り当ての整合性を取ることができます。 登録後にシステムで手動操作する必要も減ります。 LTSSクライアントのブートストラップ LTSSサブスクリプションでクライアントをブーストラッピングする場合は、アクティベーションキーの作成中にLTSSチャンネルを含めます。 帯域幅の要件 アクティベーションキーを使用すると、登録時にソフトウェアが自動ダウンロードされることがあります。この動作は、帯域幅に制約がある環境では望ましくない場合があります。 次のオプションによって帯域幅使用条件が作成されます。 SUSE Product Poolチャンネルを割り当てると、対応する製品ディスクリプタパッケージが自動インストールされます。 ［パッケージ］セクションのパッケージがインストールされます。 ［設定］セクションのSaltの状態によっては、その内容に応じてダウンロードがトリガされる場合があります。 キーラベルの命名 読んで理解しやすい名前をアクティベーションキーに入力しないと、システムが数値の文字列を自動生成するため、キーの管理が困難になる場合があります。 キーを追跡できるようにアクティベーションキーの命名規則を検討してください。 組織のインフラストラクチャに関係がある名前を付けておくと、複雑な操作の実行も簡単になります。 キーラベルを作成する場合、次のヒントを考慮してください。 OSの名前(必須): キーには、設定を指定するOS名を必ず含める必要があります。 アーキテクチャ名(推奨): 会社で稼働しているアーキテクチャ(たとえば、x86_64)が複数ある場合、アーキテクチャの種類をラベルに含めることをお勧めします。 サーバの種類の名前: このサーバの使用目的。 場所名: サーバの配置場所(部屋、ビル、部署)。 日付: 保守期間(四半期など)。 カスタム名: 組織のニーズに合う命名規則。 アクティベーションキーラベルの名前の例: sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le 含めるチャンネル アクティベーションキーを作成するときは、このキーに関連付けられているソフトウェアチャンネルも考慮する必要があります。 キーには、特定のベースチャンネルを割り当てる必要があります。 デフォルトのベースチャンネルの使用はお勧めしません。

For information about using Cobbler to prepare an ISO image, see Build an ISO Image With Cobbler. SUSEシステムでは、多くの場合、KIWIを使用してISOイメージを準備することが推奨されます。 詳細については、KIWIでSUSE ISOイメージを構築するを参照してください。 いずれの場合も、生成されたイメージをCD-ROMまたはUSBメモリに書き込みます。 Cobbler can create ISO boot images that contain a set of distributions, kernels, and a menu that works in a similar way to a PXE installation. Building ISOs with Cobbler is not supported on IBM Z. In order to prepare an ISO image with Cobbler, you need to prepare a distribution and a profile, similar to using network boot over PXE. For information about creating a distribution, see Autoinstallable Distributions. For information about creating a profile, see Autoinstallation Profiles. The Cobbler buildiso command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO. Specifying the distribution with --distro is mandatory when running buildiso command. cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro= You must use distro and profile labels as listed by Cobbler, and not simply as shown in the UI. Cobblerによって保存されているディストリビューションとプロファイルの名前を一覧表示するには、次のコマンドを実行します。 # cobbler distro list # cobbler profile list ブートISOには、すべてのプロファイルおよびシステムがデフォルトで含まれています。 --profilesオプションと--systemsオプションで、使用するプロファイルおよびシステムを制限できます。 次に例を示します。 cobbler buildiso --systems=\"system1 system2 system3\" \\ --profiles=\" --distro= ISOイメージをパブリックtmpディレクトリに書き込むことができない場合、/usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.serviceでsystemd設定を確認してください。 KIWIはイメージ作成システムです。 KIWIを使用して、SUSEシステムのインストール用にターゲットシステムで使用するブート可能なISOイメージを作成することができます。 システムを再起動または電源オンするとき、このイメージからブートし、AutoYaST設定をUyuniから読み込み、AutoYaSTプロファイルに応じてSUSE Linux Enterprise Serverをインストールします。 ISOイメージを使用するには、システムをブートし、プロンプトにautoyastと入力します(AutoYaSTブートのラベルをautoyastのままにしていることを想定しています)。 Enterキーを押してAutoYaSTのインストールを開始します。 KIWIの詳細については、http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/を参照してください。 詳細については、Build an ISO Image With Cobblerを参照してください。","title":"CD-ROMまたはUSBメモリを使用してインストールする","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-cdrom","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-cdrom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For information about Yomi, see Install with Yomi. Kickstartプロファイルには、多数の設定オプションがあります。 プロファイルを作成するには、プロファイルをアップロードするか、専用のウィザードを使用します。 Kickstartプロファイルでは、ファイル保持一覧を使用できます。 Kickstartで再インストールするクライアントにあるカスタム設定ファイルが多数ある場合、リストにしてこれらのファイルを保存し、そのリストをKickstartプロファイルに関連付けることができます。 手順: ファイル保持一覧の作成 UyuniのWeb UIで、システム 自動インストール ファイル保持に移動し、ファイル保持一覧の作成をクリックします。 適切なラベルを入力し、保存するすべてのファイルおよびディレクトリへの絶対パスをリストします。 一覧の作成をクリックします。 Kickstartプロファイルにファイル保持一覧を含めます。 システム 自動インストール プロファイルに移動して編集するプロファイルを選択し、システムの詳細 ファイル保持サブタブに移動して、含めるファイル保持一覧を選択します。 ファイル保持一覧の合計サイズは1 MBに制限されています。 /dev/hda1や/dev/sda1などの特殊なデバイスは保持できません。 ファイル名とディレクトリ名のみ使用できます。正規表現のワイルドカードは使用できません。 Kickstartの詳細については、Red Hatのドキュメントを参照してください。 インストールファイルの一部は、インストール中に置き換えられます。 変数は単一の値に置き換えられ、コードスニペットはテキストのセクション全体に置き換えられます。 エスケープされた記号やセクションは置き換えられません。 A template engine called Cheetah allows Cobbler to do these replacements. This mechanism allows you to reinstall large numbers of systems, without having to manually create profiles for each of them. 自動インストールの変数やコードスニペットは、Uyuni Web UI内で作成できます。 プロファイル内の［自動インストールファイル］タブでは、置き換えの結果を確認できます。 変数については、変数を参照してください。 コードスニペットについては、コードスニペットを参照してください。 エスケープ記号またはテキストブロックについては、エスケープを参照してください。 自動インストールの変数は、KickstartプロファイルおよびAutoYaSTプロファイルに値を代入するために使用できます。 変数を定義するには、プロファイルから［変数］サブタブに移動し、テキストボックスでname=valueペアを作成します。 たとえば、クライアントのIPアドレスを格納する変数と、ゲートウェイのアドレスを格納する変数を作成できます。 次に、作成した変数は、同じプロファイルからインストールされるすべてのクライアントに対して定義できます。 このためには、［変数］テキストボックスに次の行を追加します。 ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 変数を使用するには、プロファイルで値の前に$記号を付けて値を代入します。 たとえば、Kickstartファイルの［ネットワーク］部分は次のようになることがあります。 network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway $ipaddrは192.168.0.28に解決され、$gatewayは192.168.0.1に解決されます。 インストールファイルでは、変数は階層的に使用します。 システム変数はプロファイル変数より優先され、プロファイル変数はディストリビューション変数より優先されます。 Uyuniには、多数の定義済みコードスニペットが付属しています。 システム 自動インストール 自動インストールスニペットに移動し、既存のスニペットの一覧を表示します。 自動インストールファイルの$SNIPPET()マクロに挿入してスニペットを使用します。 たとえば、Kickstartでは次のようになります。 $SNIPPET('spacewalk/rhel_register_script') または、AutoYaSTでは次のようになります。 $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script') The macro is parsed by Cobbler and substituted with the contents of the snippet.

Uyuniサーバのコマンドプロンプトで、rootとして、次のコマンド用のブートストラップリポジトリを作成するために使用できるディストリビューションをリストします。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l 製品ラベルとして適切なリポジトリ名を使用して、ブートストラップリポジトリを作成します。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64 または、利用可能なディストリビューション一覧のディストリビューション名の横に表示されている番号を使用します。 クライアントリポジトリは/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/にあります。 複数の製品(SLESとSLES for SAPなど)をミラーリング済みの場合、またはカスタムチャンネルを使用している場合、ブートストラップリポジトリを作成するときに使用する親チャンネルを指定する必要が生じる場合があります。 これは、あらゆる状況で必須ではありません。 たとえば、SLES 15の一部のバージョンには共通のコードベースがあるため、親チャンネルを指定する必要はありません。 このプロシージャは、ご使用の環境で必要な場合のみ使用します。 オプションのプロシージャ: ブートストラップリポジトリの親チャンネルの指定 利用できる親チャンネルを確認します。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 Multiple options for parent channel

複数の異なるアーキテクチャを含むブートストラップリポジトリを作成している場合、すべてのアーキテクチャが正しく更新されることに注意を払う必要があります。 たとえば、SLEのx86-64アーキテクチャおよびIBM Zアーキテクチャは、同じブートストラップリポジトリURL(/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/sle/15/2/bootstrap/)を使用します。 フラッシュオプションを有効にすると、複数のアーキテクチャのブートストラップリポジトリを生成しようとしても、生成されるアーキテクチャは1つのみです。 この動作を回避するには、追加のアーキテクチャを作成するとき、コマンドプロンプトで--no-flushオプションを使用します。 次に例を示します。 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-SP2-x86_64 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --no-flush -c SLE-15-SP2-s390x カスタムチャンネルを使用している場合、mgr-create-bootstrap-repoコマンドを使用して--with-custom-channelsオプションを使用できます。 この場合、使用する親チャンネルも指定する必要があります。 カスタムチャンネルを使用すると、ブートストラップリポジトリの自動作成が失敗する場合があります。 この場合、リポジトリを手動で作成する必要があります。 カスタムチャンネルの詳細については、カスタムチャンネルを参照してください。","title":"ブートストラップリポジトリ","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"bootstrap-repository","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/bootstrap-repository.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

SUSE Linux EnterpriseクライアントのUnified Installer更新チャンネル チャンネルは、ソフトウェアパッケージをグループ化する方法です。 ソフトウェアパッケージはリポジトリによって提供され、リポジトリはチャンネルに関連付けられています。 クライアントをソフトウェアチャンネルにサブスクライブすると、クライアントは、これに関連付けられたソフトウェアをインストールし、更新できます。 Uyuniでは、チャンネルはベースチャンネルと子チャンネルに分割されます。 この方法でチャンネルを編成すると、互換性のあるパッケージのみが各システムにインストールされるようになります。 クライアントは、1つのベースチャンネルのみをサブスクライブして、登録中にクライアントのオペレーティングシステムおよびアーキテクチャに基づいて割り当てる必要があります。 ベンダによって提供される有料チャンネルでは、関連づけされたサブスクリプションを持っている必要があります。 ベースチャンネルは、特定のオペレーティングシステムの種類、バージョン、およびアーキテクチャのために構築されたパッケージから構成されています。 たとえば、SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86-64のベースチャンネルには、そのオペレーティングシステムおよびアーキテクチャと互換性のあるソフトウェアのみが含まれています。 子チャンネルはベースチャンネルに関連付けられていて、ベースチャンネルと互換性のあるパッケージのみを提供します。 システムは、ベースチャンネルの複数の子チャンネルにサブスクライブできます。 システムがベースチャンネルに割り当てられている場合、そのシステムは関連する子チャンネルをインストールできます。 たとえば、システムがSUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86_64 ベースチャンネルに割り当てられている場合、互換性のあるベースチャンネルまたは関連する子チャンネルのいずれかから利用できるパッケージのみインストールまたは更新できます。 UyuniのWeb UIで、ソフトウェア チャンネル一覧 すべてに移動して、利用できるチャンネルをブラウズできます。 ソフトウェア 管理 チャンネルに移動して、チャンネルを変更又は新しいチャンネルを作成できます。 カスタムチャンネルなどチャンネルを使用する方法の詳細については、Channel managementを参照してください。 SUSE Package HubはSUSE Linux Enterprise製品の拡張機能で、openSUSEコミュニティで提供する追加オープンソースソフトウェアを提供しています。 SUSE Package Hubのパッケージは、openSUSEコミュニティによって提供されます。 パッケージはSUSEではサポートされていません。 クライアントでSUSE Linux Enterpriseオペレーティングシステムを使用している場合、SUSE Package Hub拡張機能を有効にして、これらの追加パッケージにアクセスできます。 アクセスすると、クライアントのサブスクライブ先にできるSUSE Package Hubチャンネルが提供されます。 SUSE Package Hubは多数のパッケージを提供しており、大量のディスク容量を使用してパッケージの同期に長時間かかる場合があります。 提供するパッケージが必要でない場合、SUSE Package Hubを有効にしないでください。 サポートされていないパッケージを誤ってインストールまたは更新しないためには、最初にすべてのSUSE Package Hubパッケージを拒否するコンテンツライフサイクル管理戦略の実装をお勧めします。 その後、必要なパッケージを明示的に有効にできます。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理の詳細については、コンテンツライフサイクル管理を参照してください。 Red Hatベースのクライアントの場合、AppStreamから追加パッケージを利用できます。 ほとんどの場合、AppStreamパッケージでは、必要なソフトウェアをすべて持っていることを確認する必要があります。 UyuniのWeb UIでAppStreamパッケージを管理している場合、パッケージの更新に関して相反する推奨事項が表示される場合があります。 これは、Uyuniでモジュールのメタデータを正しく解釈できないことが原因です。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理(CLM)のAppStreamフィルタを使用して、AppStreamリポジトリを非モジュール型リポジトリに変換して、一部の更新操作で使用できます。 CLM AppStreamフィルタの詳細については、コンテンツライフサイクル管理の例を参照してください。 Red Hatベースのクライアントの場合、EPEL(エンタープライズ版Linux用の追加パッケージ)から追加パッケージを利用できます EPELはオプションのパッケージリポジトリで、追加ソフトウェアが提供されます。 EPELのパッケージは、Fedoraコミュニティによって提供されます。 このパッケージはSUSEではサポートされていません。 クライアントでRed Hatオペレーティングシステムを使用している場合、EPEL拡張機能を有効にして、これらの追加パッケージにアクセスできます。 アクセスすると、クライアントのサブスクライブ先にできるEPELチャンネルが提供されます。 EPELは多数のパッケージを提供しており、大量のディスク容量を使用してパッケージの同期に長時間かかる場合があります。 提供するパッケージが必要でない場合、EPELリポジトリを有効にしないでください。 サポートされていないパッケージを誤ってインストールまたは更新しないためには、最初にすべてのEPELパッケージを拒否するコンテンツライフサイクル管理(CLM)戦略の実装をお勧めします。 その後、必要なパッケージを明示的に有効にできます。 コンテンツライフサイクル管理の詳細については、コンテンツライフサイクル管理を参照してください。 このチャンネルは、オペレーティングシステムをインストールする前に、Unified Installerが最新であることを確認するためにUnified Installerで使用されます。 すべてのSUSE Linux Enterprise製品は、インストール中にインストーラ更新チャンネルにアクセスできる必要があります。 SUSE Linux Enterprise Serverクライアントでは、更新を含む製品を追加するときにデフォルトでインストーラ更新チャンネルが同期します。また、これらの製品チャンネルで自動インストールディストリビューションを作成するときに有効になります。 SUSE Linux Enterprise for SAPなどその他すべてのSUSE Linux Enterpriseの亜種では、インストーラ更新チャンネルを手動で追加する必要があります。 そのためには、適切なSUSE Linux Enterprise Serverインストーラ更新チャンネルをこれらのSUSE Linux Enterprise亜種のベースチャンネルの下に複製します。 チャンネルを複製した後にこれらのSUSE Linux Enterprise亜種の自動インストールディストリビューションを作成するとき、そのインストーラ更新チャンネルが自動的に使用されます。","title":"ソフトウェアチャンネル","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"channels","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It leverages the enterprise hardened security and compliance components of SUSE Linux Enterprise and merges them with a modern, immutable, developer-friendly OS platform. The openSUSE Leap Micro uses transactional updates. Transactional updates are atomic (all updates are applied only if all updates succeed) and support rollbacks. They do not affect the running system because no changes are activated until the system is rebooted.

Create bootstrap script 2. Modify bootstrap script 3. Run bootstrap script To migrate a system from a traditional client to a Salt, user can create the Salt bootstrap script and re-register the client system with it. This could be done with three procedures: * create a bootstrap script, * modify the bootstrap script, and * run the bootstrap script to register the client. First you create a bootstrap script with the Web UI as a template. Procedure: Creating a bootstrap script UyuniのWeb UIで、管理 マネージャ設定 ブートストラップスクリプトに移動します。 In the SUSE Manager Configuration - Bootstrap dialog, verify that the Bootstrap using Salt checkbox is checked. The required fields are pre-populated with values derived from previous installation steps. For details on each setting, see ブートストラップスクリプト. 更新をクリックしてスクリプトを作成します。 The bootstrap script is generated and stored on the server in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap directory. Alternatively, you can access the bootstrap script over HTTPS. Replace with the host name of your Uyuni Server: https:///pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh In the next step, you modify the bootstrap script as needed. It is important that you set your activation key. Navigate to Home Overview. In the Tasks box, click Manage Activation Keys. All keys created for channels are listed on this page. Enter the full name of the key you wish to use in the bootstrap script exactly as presented in the key field. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. Procedure: Modifying a bootstrap script Uyuniサーバのコマンドラインでrootとして、ブートストラップディレクトリを次のように変更します。 cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ Create a copy of the template bootstrap script for use with each of your clients. cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-migrate-to-salt.sh Open bootstrap-migrate-to-salt.sh for modification. Scroll down until you can see the text shown below. If exit 1 exists in the file, comment it out by typing a hash or pound sign (#) at the beginning of the line. This activates the script. Enter the name of the key for this script in the ACTIVATION_KEYS= field: echo \"Enable this script: comment (with #'s) this block (or, at least just\" echo \"the exit below)\" echo #exit 1 # can be edited, but probably correct (unless created during initial install): # NOTE: ACTIVATION_KEYS *must* be used to bootstrap a client machine. ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-migrate-salt ORG_GPG_KEY= When you have finished, save the file. By default, the bootstrap script will try to install venv-salt-minion for Salt clients if it is available in the bootstrap repository, or salt-minion if there is no Salt bundle in the bootstrap repository. It is posible to avoid installing Salt bundle and keep using salt-minion if you need it. 詳細については、Salt Bundleを参照してください。 As the final step, run the bootstrap script to migrate and register clients. Procedure: Running the bootstrap script On the Uyuni Server, log in as root. At the command prompt, change to the bootstrap directory: cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ Run the following command to execute the bootstrap script on the client. Replace EXAMPLE.COM with the hostname of your client: cat bootstrap-migrate-to-salt.sh | ssh root@EXAMPLE.COM /bin/bash Alternatively, on the client, run the command: curl -Sks https://server_hostname/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-migrate-to-salt.sh | /bin/bash The script downloads the required dependencies. スクリプトの実行が完了すると、クライアントが正しく登録されたかどうかを確認できます。そのためには、UyuniのWeb UIを開き、システム 概要に移動して、新しいクライアントがリストされていることを確認します。 In case of trouble with registering the new Salt client, open the Uyuni Web UI and navigate to Salt Keys to accept the client key. Uyuniを使用してクライアントに新しいパッケージまたは更新がインストールされると、エンドユーザライセンスアグリーメント(EULA)が自動的に受け入れられます。 パッケージのEULAを確認するには、Web UIでパッケージ詳細ページを開きます。 For more information about using bootstrap scripts, see ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録する.","title":"Migrate traditional clients to Salt clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-migrate-traditional","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Salt BundleによるSalt SSH 4. pipを使用したPythonパッケージによるSalt Bundleの拡張 Salt Bundleは、Salt Minion、Python 3、必須のPythonモジュール、およびライブラリが含まれている1つのバイナリパッケージです。 Salt BundleはPython 3に付属していて、Saltを実行するためのすべての要件です。したがって、Salt Bundleは、システムソフトウェアとしてクライアントにインストールされているPythonバージョンを使用しません。 Salt Bundleは、指定のSaltバージョンの要件を満たさないクライアントにインストールできます。 Uyuni Salt Master以外のSalt Masterに接続されているSalt Minionを実行するシステムでSalt Bundleを使用することもできます。 Salt Bundleを使用した登録方法は推奨の登録方法です。 このセクションでは、現在の実装の利点と制約について説明します。 Salt Bundleは、Salt、Python 3、およびSaltが依存しているPythonモジュールで構成されているvenv-salt-minionとして提供されます。 Web UIを使用したブートストラップもSalt Bundleを使用しているため、Web UIを使用したブートストラップはPythonに依存しません。 Salt Bundleを使用すると、クライアントがPythonインタープリターまたはモジュールを提供する必要がなくなります。 新しいクライアントをブートストラップする場合、Salt Bundleを使用した登録がデフォルトの方法です。 既存のクライアントをSalt Bundleの方式に切り替えることができます。 切り替える場合、salt-minionパッケージおよびその依存関係はインストールされたままになります。 The Salt Bundle can be used with the Salt Minion managed by the Salt Master other than Uyuni Server at the same time. If the Salt Bundle is installed on a client Uyuni Server will manage the configuration files of the Salt Bundle, the configuration files of salt-minion will not be managed in this case. For more information, see Salt Bundle configuration. Uyuniサーバ以外のSalt Masterによって管理されているSalt Minionを使用してクライアントをブートストラップするには、ブートストラップスクリプトを生成するときにmgr-bootstrap --force-bundleを使用するか、またはブートストラップスクリプトでFORCE_VENV_SALT_MINIONを1に設定することをお勧めします。 Web UI mgr_force_venv_salt_minionをtrueに設定してブートストラップする場合、pillarをグローバルに指定できます。 詳細については、Salt States and Pillarsを参照してください。 salt-minionからvenv-salt-minionに切り替えるためにSalt状態util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minionを使用できます。 移行プロセスのトラブルを回避するために、venv-salt-minionへの切り替えは2ステップで実行することをお勧めします。 プロシージャ: util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minionを使用して状態をvenv-salt-minionに切り替える まず、pillarを指定せずにutil.mgr_switch_to_venv_minionを適用します。 venv-salt-minionに切り替わり、設定ファイルなどがコピーされます。 元のsalt-minionの設定およびそのパッケージはクリーンアップされません。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minionを適用し、mgr_purge_non_venv_saltをTrueに設定してsalt-minionを削除し、mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_filesをTrueに設定してsalt-minionに関するすべてのファイルを削除します。 この2番目の手順によって、最初の手順が処理されたことが保証され、古い設定ファイルおよび古くなったsalt-minionパッケージが削除されます。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' 切り替えの最初の手順をスキップして2番目の手順を実行すると、クライアント側でコマンドを実行するために使用されるsalt-minionを停止する必要があるため、状態適用プロセスは失敗する可能性があります。 他方、Salt Bundleのインストールを回避して代わりにsalt-minionの使用を続けることも可能です。 この場合、次のいずれかのオプションを指定します。 --no-bundleオプションを指定してmgr-bootstrapを実行します。 生成されたブートストラップスクリプトでAVOID_VENV_SALT_MINIONを1に設定します。 ブートストラップ状態の場合、mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillarをTrueに設定します。 Salt Bundleは、クライアントに対してSalt SSHアクションを実行するときにも使用されます。 シェルスクリプトは、Saltコマンドを実行する前にvenv-salt-minionをインストールせずにSalt Bundleをターゲットシステムに配備します。Salt BundleにはSaltのコードベース全体が含まれているため、salt-thinは配備されません。Salt SSH (Web UIを使用するブートストラップを含む)は、バンドル内でPython 3インタープリターを使用します。ターゲットシステムには他のPythonインタープリターがインストールされている必要はありません。 Bundleを使用して配備されたPython 3は、クライアントでSalt SSHセッションを処理するために使用されるため、Salt SSH (Web UIを使用したブートストラップを含む)は、システムにインストールされているPythonに依存しません。 salt-thinの使用はフォールバック方法として有効にできますが、クライアントにPython 3をインストールする必要があります。 この方法は、推奨もサポートもされておらず、開発目的でのみ存在しています。 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf設定ファイルでweb.ssh_use_salt_thinをtrueに設定します。 The bootstrap repository must be created before bootstrapping the client with Web UI. Salt SSH is using the Salt Bundle taken from the bootstrap repository based on the detected target operating system. For more information, see client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository. Salt SSHは、/var/tmpを使用して、Salt Bundleを配備し、バンドルされたPythonを使用してクライアント上でSaltコマンドを実行しています。 したがって、noexecオプションを指定して/var/tmpをマウントしないでください。 ブートストラッププロセスがクライアントに到達するためにSalt SSHを使用しているため、/var/tmpがnoexecオプションでマウントされたクライアントをWeb UIでブートストラップすることはできません。 Salt Bundleにはpipが含まれており、バンドルされているSalt Minionの機能を追加のPythonパッケージで拡張できます。 デフォルトで、salt pip.install は、で指定されたPythonパッケージを/var/lib/venv-salt-minion/localにインストールします。 必要に応じて、venv-salt-minion.serviceの環境変数VENV_PIP_TARGETを設定することで、パス/var/lib/venv-salt-minion/localを上書きできます。 サービスにはsystemdのドロップイン設定ファイルを使用することをお勧めします。 設定ファイル/etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.confで実行できます。 [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip pipを使用してインストールしたPythonパッケージは、Salt Bundleの更新時に変更されません。 更新後にこのようなパッケージが使用可能で機能するようにするために、Salt Bundleの更新後に適用されるSaltの状態でパッケージをインストールすることをお勧めします。","title":"Salt Bundle","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network where the Uyuni Server is located. Push via Salt SSH is also to use if installing a daemon agent on clients is not possible. The Push via Salt SSH method has serious limitations. It does not scale well, and consumes more Server resources and network bandwidth than the plain Salt method. The Push via Salt SSH method is not at all supported with large setups (1000 clients and more). The Push via Salt SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the Uyuni Server on the internal network to the clients located in the DMZ. After all actions such as updates and events are pushed and executed, the tunnel is closed. The server uses the Salt SSH to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. 次のイメージは、Salt SSHでのプッシュプロセスのパスを示しています。 Taskomaticブロックの左側のアイテムはすべて、Uyuniクライアントで実行されるプロセスを表します。 To use Push via Salt SSH, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the salt-api daemon running on the Uyuni Server.

We encourage all new deployments to use Salt clients and Salt proxies exclusively, and to migrate existing traditional clients and proxies to Salt. Be aware that when migrating from traditional clients to Salt minions you do not have to delete the registered clients before. You can just register them as Salt minions and Salt will do the necessary steps with the traditional client. If you already deleted the traditional client and the registration as Salt minion is not possible anymore, see Troubleshooting Registering a traditional client as Salt minion after deleting it.","title":"従来のクライアントの接続メソッド","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-traditional","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-traditional.html","titles":[]},"99":{"id":99,"text":"クライアントに関してカスタマイズしたシステム情報を含めることができます。 システム情報は「キー:値」ペアで定義され、クライアントに割り当てることができます。 たとえば、特定のプロセッサに対して「キー:値」ペアを定義してから、そのプロセッサがインストールされているすべてのクライアントにそのキーを割り当てることができます。 カスタムシステム情報は分類され、UyuniのWeb UIを使用して検索できます。 始める前に、カスタム情報を保存できるキーを作成する必要があります。 プロシージャ: カスタムシステム情報のキーの作成 UyuniのWeb UIで、システム カスタムシステム情報に移動し、キーの作成をクリックします。 ［キーラベル］フィールドにキーの名前を追加します。 スペースは使用しません。 例: intel-x86_64-quadcore。 ［説明］フィールドに必要な追加情報を入力します。 必要な各キーで操作を繰り返します。 Saltクライアントの場合、この情報はSalt pillarを使用して利用できます。 次のようなコマンドを使用して、Saltクライアントからこの情報を取得できます。 salt $minionid pillar.get custom_info:key1 このコマンドは、次のような出力になります。 $minionid: val1 カスタムシステム情報キーを作成するとき、キーをクライアントに適用できます。 プロシージャ: カスタム情報キーをクライアントに適用する UyuniのWeb UIで、［システム］に移動し、カスタム情報を適用するクライアントをクリックし、詳細 カスタム情報タブに移動します。 値の作成をクリックします。 適用する値を見つけ、キーラベルをクリックします。 ［値］フィールドに追加情報を入力します。 キーの更新をクリックしてカスタム情報をクライアントに適用します。 設定管理の詳細については、設定管理を参照してください。","title":"カスタムシステム情報","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"custom-info","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/custom-info.html","titles":[]},"100":{"id":100,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. ソフトウェアチャンネルページのGPGキーのURLには、「空白」で区切られた複数のキーのURLを含めることができます。 ファイルURLの場合は、ソフトウェアチャンネルを使用する前に、GPGキーファイルをクライアントに配備する必要があります。 The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Debianベースのシステムはメタデータのみに署名するため、単一チャンネルに追加のキーを指定する必要はありません。 リポジトリメタデータの署名の「独自のGPGキーを使用する」で説明されているように、ユーザが独自のGPGキーを設定してメタデータに署名すると、そのキーの配備と信頼が自動的に実行されます。 Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. いくつかのpillarデータを提供し、SaltファイルシステムにGPGキーファイルを提供することで、自動的にクライアントに配備されます。 これらのキーは、RPMベースのオペレーティングシステムでは/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/に、Debianシステムでは/usr/share/keyrings/に配備されます。 キーを配備するクライアントのpillarキーcustom_gpgkeysを定義し、キーファイルの名前を一覧にします。 cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg さらに、Saltファイルシステムでは、gpgという名前のディレクトリを作成し、custom_gpgkeys pillarデータで指定された名前のGPGキーファイルを保存します。 ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and

ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-sles15 ORG_GPG_KEY= 完了したら、ファイルを保存し、2つ目のブートストラップスクリプトでこの手順を繰り返します。 デフォルトでは、ブートストラップスクリプトは、Saltクライアントのvenv-salt-minionがブートストラップリポジトリーにある場合にはこれをインストールしようとし、ブートストラップリポジトリーにSalt Bundleがない場合にはsalt-minionをインストールしようとします。 何らかの理由でsalt-minionが必要な場合、Salt Bundleをインストールせずにsalt-minionの使用を続けることができます。 詳細については、Salt Bundleを参照してください。 スクリプトの作成を完了したら、このスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録できます。 プロシージャ: ブートストラップスクリプトの実行 Uyuniでrootとしてログインします。 コマンドプロンプトでブートストラップディレクトリに変更します。 cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ 次のコマンドを実行して、クライアントでブートストラップスクリプトを実行します。 EXAMPLE.COMをクライアントのホスト名に置き換えます。 cat bootstrap-sles15.sh | ssh root@EXAMPLE.COM /bin/bash または、クライアントで次のコマンドを実行します。 curl -Sks https://server_hostname/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-sles15.sh | /bin/bash 問題を回避するには、ブートストラップスクリプトが bashを使用して実行されていることを確認してください。 このスクリプトは、前に作成したリポジトリディレクトリにある必要な依存関係をダウンロードします。 スクリプトの実行が完了すると、クライアントが正しく登録されたかどうかを確認できます。そのためには、UyuniのWeb UIを開き、システム 概要に移動して、新しいクライアントがリストされていることを確認します。 スクリプトを使用してSaltクライアントを登録する場合は、UyuniのWeb UIを開いて、Salt Keysに移動し、クライアントキーを受け入れます。 Uyuniを使用してクライアントに新しいパッケージまたは更新がインストールされると、エンドユーザライセンスアグリーメント(EULA)が自動的に受け入れられます。 パッケージのEULAを確認するには、Web UIでパッケージ詳細ページを開きます。","title":"ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録する","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-bootstrap","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html","titles":[{"text":"1. mgr-bootstrapでのブートストラップスクリプトの作成","hash":"_mgr_bootstrapでのブートストラップスクリプトの作成","id":1},{"text":"2.

You can then set up autoinstallation using AutoYaST or Kickstart for additional virtual hosts and for virtual guests. This section also includes information about administering virtual guests after they have been installed. The way that you set up Xen or KVM on a VM host depends on operating system you want to use on its associated guests: For SUSE operating systems, see the SLES Virtualization Guide available from https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-virtualization.html. Red Hat Enterprise Linuxオペレーティングシステムについては、使用バージョンに応じてRed Hatのドキュメントを参照してください。 Uyuni uses libvirt to install and manage guests. You must have the libvirtd package installed on your host. In most cases, the default settings are sufficient and you do not need to adjust them. However, if you want to access the VNC console on your guests as a non-root user, you need to perform some configuration changes. For more information about how to set up the VNC console, see the documentation for your operating system. You need a bootstrap script on the Uyuni Server. The bootstrap script must include the activation key for your host. We also recommend that you include your GPG key for additional security. For more on creating a bootstrap script, see ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録する. When the bootstrap script is ready, use it to register the host with the Uyuni Server. For more information about client registration, see クライアントの登録. For Salt clients, you need to enable the Virtualization Host entitlement. This allows you to see VM changes instantly. Procedure: In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the System Details page for the host, and click the Properties tab. Alternatively, the Virtualization Host entitlement can be added at the registration key level. In the Add-On System Types section, check Virtualization Host, and click Update Properties to save the changes. Restart the salt-minion service to activate the new configuration: systemctl restart salt-minion AutoYaSTまたはKickstartを使用して、XenおよびKVMのゲストを自動的にインストールして登録できます。 You need an activation key for the VM host you want to register the guests to, and for each guest. The activation key must have the provisioning and Virtualization Platform entitlements. For more information about creating activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. If you want to automatically register the guests with Uyuni after installation, you need to create a bootstrap script. For more information about creating a bootstrap script, see ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録する. Uyuniからクライアントを自動インストールできる自動インストール可能なディストリビューションをVMに作成する必要があります。 ディストリビューションは、マウントされたローカルディレクトリやリモートディレクトリから使用できたり、ループマウントされたISOイメージで使用できます。 The configuration of the autoinstallable distribution differs depending on whether you are using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE operating system on your guests. The packages for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation are fetched from the associated base channel. Packages for installing SUSE systems are fetched from the autoinstallable distribution. Therefore, for SUSE systems, the autoinstallable distribution must be a complete installation source.

So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients. This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see サポートされているクライアントシステム. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see クライアント登録メソッド. Procedure: Configure a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on your client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.suma.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.suma.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare software channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an activation key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Related topics You can use configuration files and channels to manage configuration for your clients, rather than configuring each client manually. This workflow shows you how to use the Uyuni Web UI to create a centrally managed configuration file, assign it to a Salt client, and apply the configuration. If you are managing a lot of clients, you probably do not want to manually apply configuration settings to each of them in turn. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a configuration channel containing a configuration file, have assigned clients to the channel, and applied the configuration successfully. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. At least one Salt client registered to your server. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a centrally managed configuration file and a Salt state. You can also use locally managed configuration files, traditional clients, and different methods, to get more flexibility in how you manage configuration in your environment. For more information about the different ways to manage configuration, see 設定管理. Procedure: Create a new configuration channel and file In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels and click Create State Channel.

Related topics If you are managing a lot of clients and you need to apply customized packages to them, you can use content lifecycle management (CLM) to manage your packages. CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, which you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. Procedure: Create a new CLM project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. Leave the Filters section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example. You can add filters later on if you need to. In the Environment Lifecycle section, create three environments: production, testing, and development. Click Add Environment and complete the name and label for each. For the production environment, leave the Insert before field blank. For the testing environment, in the Insert before field, select production. For the development environment, in the Insert before field, select testing``. Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel -production-. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel -testing-. Click Next to assign the client. Procedure: Promote Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section.

Migration of Traditional clients This workflow shows how to automatically complete the task of in-place SUSE Linux Enterprise Server instances upgrade with Uyuni Server. The workflow is applicable for both Salt and Traditional clients. In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade true #if $channel_prefix != \"\" https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #else https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #end if $channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool sle-manager-tools Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration depending on the type of your client. For Salt clients, go to Migration of Salt clients. For Traditional clients, go to Migration of Traditional clients. Procedure: Migrating Salt clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. + image::wf-inplaceMigration-06.png[scaledwidth=80%] + image::wf-inplaceMigration-07.png[scaledwidth=80%] Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time for Salt clients. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console. If your profile is clean, it should complete an in-place migration in about 30 minutes - depending on the speed of your network, client, and the number of required packages in the migration. Procedure: Migrating Traditional clients Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. If your system is able to use PXE, it can be completely automated from here. If your system is not able to use PXE, you can create an ISO to install with cobbler commands using the SUSE Manager Server CLI. Copy the ISO file output to the machine you wish to migrate and boot from it. View all the profiles with this: cobbler profile list Output will look something like: 15sp1-demo-test:1:Demosite Then build the ISO file with this command: cobbler buildiso --iso=/tmp/15sp1-demo-test.iso --profiles=15sp1-demo-test:1:Demosite The --iso= section is the output of the buildiso command, and needs full path. Copy this ISO to the virtualization environment where your system can use it as boot media.","title":"In-place upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Related topics This workflow shows how to manually remove SUSE provided channels from Uyuni and to clean up end-of-life products, to reclaim space or for other purposes. Manual channel removal consists of Preparing to remove a channel and Removing channel. Before removing a channel, you must identify the label for the channel to be removed. It can be done with Web UI or on the command line. Be careful not to remove channels that systems are currently subscribed to, or that you are planning on subscribing a system to. If there are systems that are currently subscribed to a channel that you want to delete, do not remove the channel until those systems are upgraded or unsubscribed. Procedure: Identifying channel labels using Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, in the sidebar navigate to Software Channel List All. This page displays the Channel Name. If you select the link for a channel name, you will see the field for Channel Label. Identify the channel, and child channels, to be removed. Procedure: Identifying channel labels using the command line You can get a list of channels by running the following command: spacewalk-remove-channel -l Procedure: Verifying channel system subscriptions using Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, in the sidebar navigate to Software Channel List All. Locate Systems column on the right. Check the Systems column for the channel, or any child channels, that you want to remove. Procedure: Verify channel system subscriptions using the command line Run the following command: spacecmd -- softwarechannel_listsystems A channel, with its metadata, can be removed in the SUMA command line by using the spacewalk-remove-channel command. This command does not remove the packages themselves from the filesystem. Removing packages from the filesystem is described in [cleaning-up-channel-packages]. Procedure: Removing an individual channel using the command line To remove an individual channel run the following command: spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label + . To remove multiple channels at the same time, use -c flag for each channel, followed by the channel-label. For example: + spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label1 -c channel-label2 Listing 1. Procedure: Removing a parent and all its child channels . It is also possible to remove a parent channel with all of its child channels, like this: spacewalk-remove-channel -a sles12-sp5-pool-x86_64 Listing 2. Procedure: Clean the packages from the filesystem . The following command checks for anything that is still showing in the filesystem, but not in the SUMA database and then removes it. # spacewalk-data-fsck -r -S -C -O + The final cleanup command can take several minutes, or even hours to complete.

PAYGインスタンスを接続する 1.1. インスタンス接続データを削除する 2. インスタンス資格情報収集ステータス 3. PAYGシステムをクライアントとして登録する 4. Troubleshooting 3つの主要なパブリッククラウドプロバイダー(AWS、GCP、Azure)では、SUSEは、 SLES、SLES for SAPなどのカスタマイズされたPAYG製品イメージを提供します。 PAYGとして利用可能な製品のリポジトリをミラーリングするリージョンごとのRMTサーバを運用します このドキュメントでは、既存のPAYGインスタンスをUyuniサーバに接続する方法について説明し、インスタンスからの資格情報の収集に関する基本的な情報を提供します。 この接続の目的は、認証データを抽出して、UyuniサーバがクラウドRMTホストに接続できるようにすることです。 これにより、UyuniサーバはSUSE Customer Center組織資格情報ではまだ利用できないRMTホスト上の製品にアクセスできるようになります。 Before using the PAYG feature ensure: PAYGインスタンスが正しいSUSE製品イメージ(例: SLES、SLES for SAP、SLE HPC)から起動され、目的のリポジトリにアクセスできる Uyuniサーバが直接または要塞経由でPAYGインスタンス(理想的には同じリージョン内)に接続できる 基本的なSUSE Customer Centerアカウントが必要です。有効なSUSE Customer Center資格情報を管理 セットアップウィザード 組織の資格情報に入力します。このアカウントは、PAYGインスタンスに関係なく、ブーストラッピング用のUyuniクライアントツールにアクセスするために必要です。 PAYGインスタンスをSUSE Managerにブートストラップする場合、SUSE ManagerはそのPAYGリポジトリを無効にしてから、RMTサーバからのデータをミラーリングした場所からリポジトリを追加します。最終的な結果は、PAYGインスタンスがRMTサーバからSUSE Managerサーバ自体を介して同じリポジトリを取得することになります。もちろん、リポジトリは主にSCCから引き続きセットアップできます。 手順: 新しいPAYGインスタンスを接続する UyuniのWeb UIで、管理 セットアップウィザード PAYGに移動し、PAYGの追加をクリックします。 ページセクション［PAYGの接続の説明］から始めます。 ［説明］フィールドに、説明を追加します。 ページセクション［インスタンスSSH接続データ］に移動します。 ［ホスト］フィールドに、Uyuniから接続するインスタンスのDNSまたはIPアドレスを入力します。 ［SSHポート］フィールドに、ポート番号を入力するか、デフォルト値22を使用します。 ［ユーザ］フィールドに、クラウドで指定されているユーザ名を入力します。 ［パスワード］フィールドに、パスワードを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵］フィールドに、インスタンスキーを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵のパスフレーズ］フィールドに、キーパスフレーズを入力します。 認証キーは常にPEM形式である必要があります。 インスタンスに直接接続していないが、SSH要塞を介して接続している場合は、プロシージャ: SSH要塞接続データの追加に進みます。 それ以外の場合は、手順: PAYGの接続を完了するに進みます。 プロシージャ: SSH要塞接続データの追加 ページセクション［要塞SSH接続データ］に移動します。 ［ホスト］フィールドに、要塞のホスト名を入力します。 ［SSHポート］フィールドに、要塞のポート番号を入力します。 ［ユーザ］フィールドに、要塞のユーザ名を入力します。 ［パスワード］フィールドに、要塞のパスワードを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵］フィールドに、要塞キーを入力します。 ［SSH機密鍵のパスフレーズ］フィールドに、要塞キーのパスフレーズを入力します。 手順: PAYGの接続を完了するを使用してセットアッププロセスを完了します。 手順: PAYGの接続を完了する 新しいPAYG接続データの追加を完了するには、作成をクリックします。 PAYG接続データの［詳細］ページに戻ります。 更新された接続ステータスは、［情報］という名前の上部セクションに表示されます。 接続ステータスは、［ 管理 > セットアップウィザード > Pay-as-you-go］画面にも表示されます。 インスタンスの認証データが正しい場合、［ステータス］列に「資格情報が正常に更新されました」と表示されます。 いずれかの時点で無効なデータが入力されると、新しく作成されたインスタンスが［管理 > セットアップウィザード > PAYG］に表示され、［ステータス］列にエラーメッセージが表示されます。 サーバで認証データが利用可能になるとすぐに、利用可能な製品のリストが更新されます。 Available products are all versions of the same product family and architecture as the one installed in the PAYG instance. For example, if the instance has the SLES 15 SP1 product installed, SLES 15 SP2, SLES 15 SP3, SLES 15 SP4 and SLES 15 SP5 are automatically shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > Products. 製品が利用可能として表示されたら、ユーザは、製品名の横にあるチェックボックスを選択し製品の追加をクリックして、Uyuniに製品を追加できます。 成功メッセージの後、ソフトウェア > チャンネル一覧 > すべてに移動して、Web UIで新しく追加されたチャンネルを確認できます。 各チャンネルの同期の進行状況を監視するには、Uyuniサーバの /var/log/rhn/reposyncディレクトリにあるログファイルを確認します。 PAYGインスタンスとSUSE Customer Centerサブスクリプションの1つによって製品が提供されている場合、その製品は製品リストに1回のみ表示されます。 その製品に属するチャンネルが同期されている場合でも、データはSCCサブスクリプションからのものであり、従量課金制インスタンスからのものではない可能性があります。 以下の手順では、インスタンスのSSH接続データを削除する方法について説明します。 手順: インスタンスへの接続データを削除する 管理 > セットアップウィザード > PAYGを開きます。 既存のインスタンスのリストでインスタンスを見つけます。 インスタンスの詳細をクリックします。 削除を選択し、選択を確認します。 インスタンスのリストに戻ります。 削除したばかりのものは表示されなくなります。 Uyuniサーバは、インスタンスから収集された資格情報を使用してRMTサーバに接続し、reposyncを使用してパッケージをダウンロードします。これらの資格情報は、定義されたSSH接続データを使用してtaskomaticによって10分ごとに更新されます。RMTサーバへの接続では、常にPAYGインスタンスから収集された最新の既知の認証資格情報が使用されます。 The status of the PAYG instance credentials collect is shown in the column Status or on the instance details page. When the instance is unreachable, the credential update process will fail and the credentials will become invalid after the second failed refresh. Synchronization of channels will fail when the credentials are invalid. To avoid this keep the connected instances running. PAYGインスタンスは、SSH接続データが明示的に削除されない限り、Uyuniサーバに接続されたままになります。インスタンスへのSSH接続データを削除するには、手順: インスタンスへの接続データを削除するを使用します。 PAYGインスタンスは、Uyuniサーバから常にアクセスできるとは限りません。 インスタンスが存在するが停止している場合は、最新の既知の資格情報を使用してインスタンスへの接続が試行されます。 資格情報が有効である期間は、クラウドプロバイダーによって異なります。 インスタンスが存在しなくなったが、SUMAに登録されている場合、その資格情報は無効になり、認証は失敗します。 エラーメッセージは［ステータス］列に表示されます。 エラーメッセージは、インスタンスが使用できないことを示すだけです。インスタンスのステータスに関する詳細な診断は、クラウドプロバイダーで実行する必要があります。 PAYGインスタンスで次のアクションまたは変更を行うと、資格情報が機能しなくなります。 * zypper資格情報ファイルの削除 * インポートした証明書の削除 * /etc/hostsからのクラウド固有エントリの削除 資格情報をSaltクライアントとして収集する場所からPAYGインスタンスを登録できます。 インスタンスには有効なクラウド接続が登録されている必要があります。登録されていないとチャンネルにアクセスできません。 ユーザがクラウドパッケージを削除すると、資格情報の収集が機能しなくなる場合があります。 最初にPAYGインスタンスを設定して、認証データを収集し、チャンネルを同期できるようにします。 残りのプロセスは、パブリッククラウド以外のクライアントの場合と同じで、チャンネルの同期、ブートストラップスクリプトの自動作成、アクティベーションキーの作成、および登録の開始で構成されます。 クライアントの登録の詳細については、 クライアントの登録を参照してください。 資格情報の確認 スクリプトが資格情報の収集に失敗した場合、ログとWeb UIに適切なエラーメッセージが表示されます。 If the credentials are not working, reposync should show the proper error. Using registercloudguest Refreshing or changing the registercloudguest connection to the public cloud update infrastructure should not interfere with the credentials usage. Running `registercloudguest --clean will cause problems if no new cloud connection is registered with the cloud guest command.","title":"PAYGインスタンスの接続","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"connect-payg","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/connect-payg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Add 100 MB per SUSE product, 1 GB per Red Hat or other product. Double the space if the server is an ISS Master. Swap space 3 GB Uyuniのパフォーマンスは、ハードウェアリソース、ネットワーク帯域幅、クライアントとサーバ間の遅延などによって異なります。 経験および使用されているさまざまな配備に基づいて、適切な数のプロキシを備えたUyuniサーバの最適なパフォーマンスを得るためには、単一サーバあたり10,000クライアントを超えないようにすることをお勧めします。 クライアント数が10,000を超える場合は、ハブのセットアップに移行し、コンサルティングを利用することを強くお勧めします。 微調整と適切な数のプロキシを使用しても、このような多数のクライアントによって、パフォーマンスの問題が生じる可能性があります。 多数のクライアント管理の詳細については、Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deploymentsを参照してください。 Table 2. プロキシハードウェア要件 ハードウェア 詳細 推奨 CPU 専用64ビットCPUコア数は2つ以上 RAM テストサーバ 2 GB以上 運用サーバ 8 GB以上 ディスク容量 / (ルートディレクトリ) 40 GB以上 /srv 100 GB以上 /var/cache (Squid) 100 GB以上 Uyuniプロキシは、/var/cache/ディレクトリにパッケージをキャッシュします。 /var/cache/の容量が不足している場合、プロキシは、古くなった、使用されていないパッケージを削除し、新しいパッケージに置き換えます。 この動作の結果は以下のとおりです。 プロキシ上の/var/cache/ディレクトリの容量を大きくすると、このディレクトリとUyuniサーバ間のトラフィックが少なくなります。 プロキシ上の/var/cache/ディレクトリをUyuniサーバ上の/var/spacewalk/と同じサイズにすることで、最初に同期した後のトラフィック量の増大が防止されます。 /var/cache/ディレクトリは、Uyuniサーバ上ではプロキシと比べて小さくできます。 サイズの推測のガイドについては、 サーバハードウェアの要件 セクションを参照してください。 リポジトリとUyuniのデータベースは個別のストレージデバイスに保存することをお勧めします。 こうするとデータの損失が防止されます。 YaST Uyuniの設定プロシージャを実行する前にストレージデバイスを設定する必要があります。 Uyuniでは、3つの異なるボリュームが必要です。 データベースボリューム: /var/lib/pgsql チャンネルボリューム: /var/spacewalk キャッシュ: /var/cache すべてのボリュームで、ファイルシステムの種類にはXFSを使用することをお勧めします。 また、オンプレミスインストールでは、論理ボリューム管理(LVM)を使用してディスクを管理することを検討してください。 リポジトリストレージのディスクのサイズは、Uyuniで管理するディストリビューションおよびチャンネルの数によって決まります。 必要サイズを推測するガイドについては、このセクションの表を参照してください。 Uyuniサーバで、次のコマンドを使用して、利用できるすべてのストレージデバイスを検索します。 hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"デバイスファイル:\" lsblkコマンドを使用して、各デバイスの名前とサイズを表示します。 suma-storageコマンドにデバイス名を付けて、データベースおよびリポジトリの場所として外部デバイスを設定します。 suma-storage [] 外部ストレージボリュームは、/manager_storageおよび/pgsql_storageにマウントされているXFSパーティションとして設定されます。 チャンネルデータとデータベースの両方に同じストレージデバイスを使用できます。 これはお勧めしません。その理由は、チャンネルリポジトリが大きくなると、ストレージがいっぱいになり、データベースの一貫性が損なわれるリスクが生じるためです。 別々のストレージデバイスを使用すると、パフォーマンスが向上する場合もあります。 1つのストレージデバイスを使用する場合、1つのデバイス名パラメータを指定してsuma-storageを実行します。 プロキシをインストールしている場合、suma-storageコマンドはデバイス名パラメータを1つだけ取り、外部ストレージの場所をSquidキャッシュとして設定します。 Uyuniサーバおよびプロキシのディスクパーティションを作成する場合、パーミッションを正しく設定してください。 /var/lib/pgsqlの場合: オーナー: 読み取り、書き込み、実行 グループ: 読み取り、実行 ユーザ: なし /var/spacewalkの場合: オーナー: 読み取り、書き込み、実行 グループ: 読み取り、書き込み、実行 ユーザ: 読み取り、実行 次のコマンドでパーミッションを確認してください。 ls -l /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk 出力は次のようになります。 drwxr-x--- 1 postgres postgres /var/lib/pgsql drwxrwxr-x 1 wwwrun www /var/spacewalk 必要に応じて、次のコマンドでパーミッションを変更します。 chmod 750 /var/lib/pgsql chmod 775 /var/spacewalk オーナーでは次のコマンドを使用します。 chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql chown wwwrun:www /var/spacewalk","title":"ハードウェア要件","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. サーバハードウェアの要件","hash":"server-hardware-requirements","id":1},{"text":"2. プロキシハードウェア要件","hash":"_プロキシハードウェア要件","id":2},{"text":"3. ストレージデバイスとパーミッション","hash":"_ストレージデバイスとパーミッション","id":3}]},"167":{"id":167,"text":"Table of Contents 1. システム要件 2.

However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service. The uyuni-proxy CLI bundled with the package, runs update image with the following parameters: -s (サービス名を指定します) -t (バージョンタグを指定します) -r (レジストリパスを指定します) たとえば、次のように使用します。 uyuni-proxy update image -s httpd -t 0.1.0 -r registry.opensuse.org/uyuni It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where registry.opensuse.org/uyuni is the registry and 0.1.0 is the version tag, before restarting it. To reset the values to defaults, run the proxy reset command, specifying the service with the -s parameter: uyuni-proxy reset -s httpd このコマンドは、httpdサービスの設定をグローバルデフォルトにリセットして再ロードします。 詳細については、uyuni-proxy --helpを参照してください。 Uyuniプロキシコンテナは、いわゆるノードポートサービスとして機能します。 これは、プロキシコンテナポッドがコンテナホストネットワークのTCPおよびUDPポートスペースを共有することを意味します。 このため、コンテナホストファイアウォールは、Uyuniプロキシコンテナが使用するポートで着信トラフィックを受け入れるように設定する必要があります。 これらのポートは次のとおりです。 69/UDP - TFTP 80/TCP - HTTP 443/TCP - HTTPS 4505/TCP - Salt 4506/TCP - Salt 8022/TCP - SSH 次に、インストールしたUyuniプロキシをコンテナ化されたUyuniプロキシの設定でコンテナとしてセットアップを続行します。","title":"Install containerized Uyuni Proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"proxy-container-installation","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/proxy-container-installation.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_5 \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see openSUSE Leapクライアントの登録. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[]. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録する. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL証明書. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see ネットワークを通じてインストールする(PXEブート). Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Managerのプロキシ設定. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_5 \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see openSUSE Leapクライアントの登録. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[]. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントを登録する. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL証明書. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see ネットワークを通じてインストールする(PXEブート). Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Managerのプロキシ設定. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

We recommend that you create lower level administration accounts for organizations and groups. Do not share the main administration access details. Procedure: Setting Up the Main Administration Account In your web browser, enter the address for the Uyuni Web UI. This address was provided after you completed setup. Sign in to the Web UI, navigate to the Create Organization Organization Name field, and enter your organization name. In the Create Organization Desired Login and Create Organization Desired Password fields, enter your username and password. Fill in the account information fields, including an email for system notifications. Click Create Organization to finish creating your administration account. When you have completed the Uyuni Web UI setup, you are taken to the Home Overview page. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This table lists architecture, channels, and status information. If your SUSE Linux Enterprise client is based on x86_64 architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products to start product synchronization. When a channel is added, Uyuni will schedule the channel for synchronization. Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time. You can monitor synchronization progress in the Web UI. For more information about using the setup wizard, see Wizard. When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients.

Configuration Management CLI Tool Components Package name Tool name Installed on Use for mgr-cfg-client mgrcfg-client Client Managing client configuration mgr-cfg-managemnet mgrcfg-manager Client Managing server configuration mgr-actions-control mgr-actions-control Client Administer configuration settings Clients do not have configuration management enabled by default. To get started, install the mgr-actions-control tool on the Uyuni Server, and use it to enable configuration management for your organization. Use the mgr-actions-control tool to enable and disable configuration management on a client. Actions that can be performed with mgr-actions-control include: Deploy a configuration file on a client Upload a file from the client Compare the configuration tools available on a client, with what is being used Run remote commands You must be logged in to Uyuni with an administrator account to use mgr-actions-control. This tool works by adding or removing files and directories on the client in the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/ directory. By default, this directory requires root permissions. The available options for mgr-actions-control are listed in this table. Use this syntax for mgr-actions-control commands: mgr-actions-control [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option] Table 2. Action Control Options Option Abbreviated Option Description enable-all Enable all options disable-all Disable all options. enable-deploy Allow mgrcfg-client to deploy files. enable-diff Allow mgrcfg-client to diff files. enable-upload Allow mgrcfg-client to upload files. enable-mtime-upload Allow mgrcfg-client to upload file modification time. enable-run Enable running scripts. disable-deploy Disable deployment. disable-diff Disable diff use. disable-upload Disable file uploads. disable-mtime-upload Disable modification time upload. disable-run Disable running scripts. report Report whether modes are enabled or disabled. force f Force the operation without asking first. help h Show help message and exit. For more information about the available options for the mgr-actions-control tool, see the man page: man mgr-actions-control Use the mgrcfg-client tool to manage configuration on a client. The mgrcfg-client has these primary modes: list get channels diff verify The available commands and arguments for mgrcfg-client are listed in this section. Use this syntax for mgrcfg-client commands: mgrcfg-client [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option] [mode] The list mode lists the configuration files for the client, including the labels of the configuration channels containing them. To see a complete list of all the configuration files that are currently applied to the client, use this command: mgrcfg-client list The output looks like this: DoFoS Config Channel File F config-channel-17 /etc/config-file F config-channel-17 /var/spool/aalib.rpm F config-channel-14 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf In this output, DoFoS means Directory, File, or Something else. Each entry in the output will be marked with D, F, or S. These configuration files apply to the client. Get more detail about a channel by specifying the channel name: mgrcfg-client list config-channel-14 The output looks like this: Files in config channel 'config-channel-14' /etc/config-file /etc/rhn/rhn.conf It is possible that there are duplicate configuration files in different channels. In this case, the file listing for the channel shows files that are not present when listing channels applied to the client. This is a result of file ranking, which means that channels can contain files that are not applied to the client, because they are outranked by a different file from a different channel. The get mode displays the contents of the primary configuration file for the client. To see the configuration file with the highest rank within the channel, use this command: mgrcfg-client get To see a specific configuration file, use this command: mgrcfg-client get The available options for mgrcfg-client get are listed in this table.

Use the mgrcfg-manager tool to manage the configuration files and channels on the Uyuni Server. It does not manage configuration on a client. The mgrcfg-manager tool has these primary modes: add create-channel diff diff-revisions download-channel get list list-channels remove remove-channel revisions update upload-channel Each mode has further options. See the available options using this syntax: mgrcfg-manager --help The available commands and arguments for mgrcfg-manager are listed in this section. Use this syntax for mgrcfg-manager commands: mgrcfg-manager [-h] [--version] [-v] [mode] [--option] By default, the mgrcfg-manager tool times out after thirty minutes. You can change this value in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file by adding or adjusting this line, with a value in minutes: server.session_lifetime = The add mode adds a configuration file from your local filesystem to an existing channel. Use this command: mgrcfg-manager add --channel= You can use options to modify the file during addition. For example, to change the path or file name, use this command: mgrcfg-manager add --channel= \\ --dest-file= The output looks like this: Pushing to channel Local file -> remote file The available options for mgrcfg-manager add are listed in this table.

The primary use of mgr-sync is to connect to the SUSE Customer Center, retrieve product and package information, and prepare channels for synchronization with the Uyuni Server. このツールは、SUSEサポートサブスクリプションで使用するように設計されています。 openSUSE、CentOS、Ubuntuなどのオープンソースディストリビューションには必要ありません。 mgr-syncに使用できるコマンドおよび引数を以下の表に一覧表示しています。 mgr-syncコマンドには次の構文を使用します。 mgr-sync [-h] [--version] [-v] [-s] [-d {1,2,3}] {list,add,refresh,delete} Table 1. mgr-syncコマンド コマンド 説明 使用例 list チャンネル、組織の資格情報、または製品を一覧表示する mgr-sync list channels add チャンネル、組織の資格情報、または製品を追加する mgr-sync add channel refresh 製品、チャンネル、およびサブスクリプションのローカルコピーを更新する mgr-sync refresh delete ローカルシステムから既存のSCC組織の資格情報を削除する mgr-sync delete credentials sync 指定されたチャンネルを同期するか、空白のままの場合は尋ねる mgr-sync sync channel コマンドに固有のオプションの全リストを表示するには、次のコマンドを使用します。 mgr-sync --help Table 2. mgr-syncオプション引数 オプション 短縮オプション 説明 使用例 help h コマンドの使用方法とオプションを表示する mgr-sync --help version N/A 現在インストールされているバージョンのmgr-syncを表示する mgr-sync --version verbose v 詳細な出力を提供する mgr-sync --verbose refresh store-credentials s 資格情報をローカルの隠しファイルに保存する mgr-sync --store-credentials debug d 追加のデバッグ情報をログに記録する。レベル 1、2、3が必要です。3は、最も多くのデバッグ情報を提供します。 mgr-sync -d 3 refresh no-sync N/A add コマンドと一緒に使用して、同期を開始せずに製品またはチャンネルを追加する mgr-sync --no-sync add mgr-syncのログは次の場所にあります。 /var/log/rhn/mgr-sync.log /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_api.log The spacewalk-repo-sync tool synchronizes software repositories into Uyuni channels. In most cases, this happens automatically, but you can use the tool to run it manually if required. The spacewalk-repo-sync tool has these primary commands: Table 3. spacewalk-repo-sync Options Option Description Example Use list List all custom channels and the repositories assigned to them. spacewalk-repo-sync --list channel Synchronize a single channel to all repositories assigned to it. spacewalk-repo-sync --channel deep-verify ignore cached package checksums. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify force-all-errata force re-importing all the patches. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify no-packages excludes packages from the operation. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify --no-packages For a complete list of options, see the spacewalk-repo-sync manpage: man spacewalk-repo-sync If you are having trouble synchronizing with spacewalk-repo-sync you can find out more by watching the HTTP log as the command runs. Procedure: Troubleshooting Synchronization Problems Log the HTTP output into /var/log/zypper.log: ZYPP_MEDIA_CURL_DEBUG=2 spacewalk-repo-sync --channel Export the setting: export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG Start the synchronization: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel --type yum You can increase the debug level, by adding the [option]``-vvv`` option to the command. When the complete completes, or fails, disable debug mode: unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG You can add custom HTTP headers to the requests made by spacewalk-repo-sync at the time of synchronization. The custom HTTP headers are defined in the /etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf configuration file. The headers can be defined by repository name or channel label. You can also define global headers by putting them in the main section. For example: [testchannel] X-MY-HEADER-1=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-2=VALUE [mychannel] X-MY-HEADER-3=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-4=VALUE [main] X-MYGLOBAL-HEADER=VALUE This can be particularly useful when dealing with Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repositories in the public cloud.","title":"Synchronization CLI Tools","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"cli-sync","url":"/uyuni/reference/cli-sync.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Comparing containerized and non-containerized workflows 5. Validating Saltboot group configuration To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server 4.3 or newer one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized Uyuni for Retail environment does not use Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using Uyuni Server 4.3 or newer. Older images will not work. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configure DHCP for PXE booting. See DHCPd Formula how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server. Without using DHCP formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. See below for example. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Follow guide システムグループ to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. With this, our branch group is converted to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot Groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. See Terminal Names for explanation of possible configurations. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server 4.3 where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is build and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Non-Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with what parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Deploying new images 1.1. Controlling image versions This file describes how to deploy a new image on selected terminals first, test it, and then deploy it to all terminals. The hardware type group (i.e. HWTYPE group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the Saltboot formula. This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. Procedure: Dual group image deployment Build new image. Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Saltboot Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see イメージの構築と管理. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see PrometheusとGrafanaを使用したモニタリング. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The Saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the Saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the Saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the Saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Image Synchronizing to the Branch Server If you have very large images that you need to synchronize to the branch server, you can use delta images to save network bandwidth. A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be - and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar file in /srv/susemanager/pillar_data/images/. Performance tuning is possible with the -B option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once 2. Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains 3. Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot 4. Configure the Server to Auto-Accept You can configure Uyuni to automatically accept the keys of newly deployed terminals. This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once On the branch server, create a configuration file called /etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key At the command prompt, add the new configuration file to the existing initrd: echo ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf | / cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 11/12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 11 and SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the element, add: Save the file and rebuild the image. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot Configure the PXE formula to specify these kernel parameters during booting: SALT_AUTOSIGN_GRAINS=autosign_key: PXE boot the Salt client. The formula creates the ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf configuration file and passes it to initrd. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept On the Uyuni Server, open the master configuration file in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, and add or edit this line: autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot: For multiple keys, put each one on a new line.

Deploy Terminals over a Wireless Network 2.1. Change Wireless Credentials 2.2. Use Multiple Wireless Networks If you are not able to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if= of= When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. Build the image. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Deploy Images to the Terminals 5. Customize the Terminal Image Download Process When you have the Uyuni Server and Branch Server set up, you are ready to deploy point-of-service terminals by following these steps: Create hardware type groups Assign and configure the Saltboot formula for each hardware type group Synchronize images to the branch server Deploy images to the terminals Each procedure is detailed in this section. For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. For Uyuni 4.2 and later, terminals can be either x86-64 or ARM64 architecture. For earlier versions, terminals must be x86 architecture only. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see イメージの構築と管理. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync If you have 32-bit machines included in your branch, then you must use a 32-bit boot image as a default boot image. If a 32-bit boot image is not used as a default boot image, 32-bit terminals will be unable to boot and operate properly. Check the available boot images and their architecture from the command line: salt pillar.item boot_images Output: POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0: ---------- arch: x86_64 ... legacy-6.0.0: ---------- arch: i686 In this example, the legacy-6.0.0 boot image is 32-bit. You can set the default boot image in the Image Synchronization formula on the branch server, by adding the chosen boot image name to the Default boot image field. For more information about Image Synchronization formula, see Image Synchronization Formula. When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. /srv/pillar/top.slsファイルを編集します。 base: '*': - saltboot_proto Edit the /srv/pillar/saltboot_proto.sls file: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. /srv/pillar/top.slsファイルを編集します。 base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Edit the /srv/pillar/$branch_prefix.sls file: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin.","title":"Deployment basics","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Partitioning and Image Deployment Formula Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your Uyuni for Retail installation. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to apply common Uyuni formulas. For the most commonly used formulas, see Salt Formulas. All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. If you are unsure of the correct formula configuration details, run the retail_branch_init command before you begin to create the recommended formula configuration. You can then manually edit the formulas as required. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula VSFTP formula, see VsFTPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services. Use the Saltboot formula to specify disk partitioning, and to select which image should be deployed. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula.","title":"Introduction to Retail Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-formulas-intro","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-formulas-intro.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Synchronize Images to the Branch Server To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies, or containerized proxy one or more Uyuni build hosts This section covers how to configure your Uyuni for Retail environment, including: Prepare POS images Prepare system groups Configure services for Saltboot Synchronize POS images to the branch servers The very first time you set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps. You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see イメージの構築と管理. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. SLES 11 reached end of life and is no longer supported and can stop working at any moment. POS Terminals based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP 3 can be deployed in much the same way as other terminals, with a few differences. You must use the SLES 11 template SLES 11 images need to be activated with the SLES11 SP3 i586 and SLEPOS 11 SP3 i586 channels Ensure that SLES 11 images are built on the SLES 11 build host. Building on the incorrect build host will cause your build to fail. If you are building images for SLES 11 using profiles from an HTTPS git repository that uses TLS 1.0 or greater, it will fail. SLES 11 does not support later versions of TLS. You will need to clone the repository locally to use it for building. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. システムグループの詳細については、システムグループを参照してください。 During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see PrometheusとGrafanaを使用したモニタリング. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansibleの統合. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server ; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server ; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly. For more information about Image Synchronization Formula, see Image Synchronization Formula.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Mass Configuration 1.1. Configure Multiple Branch Servers 2. Terminal Mass Configuration 2.1. Configure Multiple Terminals 3. Export Configuration to Mass Configuration File Mass configuration is possible with branch servers and terminals. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see openSUSE Leapを使用したUyuniプロキシのインストール. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements. The branch servers are in the same network as the Uyuni Server, and terminals use an isolated branch network. In this configuration, the branch servers are in the corporate network, and provide all DHCP, DNS, PXE, FTP, and TFTP services to the terminals in the branch networks. The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides PXE, FTP, and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network. The branch server and the terminals are connected to the same network as the Uyuni Server. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides PXE, FTP, and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network.

Cached Terminal Updates If the Uyuni Server is offline, you can still perform some operations on the terminals. This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded. When the terminal is rebooted and an uptodate POS image is found in the service partition, the terminal will automatically use this cached image for system redeployment.","title":"Offline Use","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-offline","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-offline.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains 2. Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values 3. Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call 4. Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Systems provisioned by Saltboot are usually redeployed or repartitioned automatically when a new image is available, or Saltboot partitioning changes. Occasionally, however, it is needed to force Saltboot to redeploy an image or repartition disk, even when automation would not do so. For these situations, Saltboot offers three ways to force redeployment or repartitioning: Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Repartitioning of a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions. Saltboot redeployment grains have no side effects, and do not require any further configuration. The limitation is that terminal must be accessible by salt. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Procedure: Forcing a Saltboot to repartition the hard disk On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_repartition Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Saltboot custom values remove the limitation on terminal being reachable by salt, however there are configuration steps. Custom info keys and values can be also managed using API or spacecmd command. For more information, see custominfo. Procedure: Create custom info key for image redeployment In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Custom System Info. Click Create Key to create new Custom Info Key. As Key Label fill in saltboot_force_redeploy. As Description fill in Force redeploy Saltboot image. Click Create Key. Creating saltboot_force_redeploy custom key is a one time operation. When created, it is available for repeated use. Procedure: Assign custom value for image redeployment Navigate to the Overview page of the system you want to redeploy. Select tab Custom Info. Click on Create Value. From the list of available keys click saltboot_force_redeploy. As Value type True. Click Update Key. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment custom info setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. Procedure: Create custom info key for disk repartitioning Navigate to menu::Systems[Custom System Info] page. Click Create Key to create new Custom Info Key. As Key Label fill in saltboot_force_repartition. As Description fill in Force terminal disk repartition. Click Create Key. Creating saltboot_force_repartition custom key is one time operation.

Click on Create Value. From the list of available keys click saltboot_force_repartition. As Value type True. Click Update Key. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. An API call system.setPillar can be used to set specific Saltboot options through Salt pillar data. Uyuni Saltboot integration is using tuning-saltboot pillar category to manage Saltboot tuning, including forced redeployment or disk repartition. Using this pillar category allows Uyuni to reset Saltboot flag once the terminal is booted up. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image using API call using spacecmd command In the console run following the command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_redeployment\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to repartition disk using API call using spacecmd command In the console run the following command, replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_repartition\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Check Saltboot tuning options In the console run the following command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot' system.getPillar Make sure to use tuning-saltboot as pillar category in the API call. Pillars specified outside of Uyuni database cannot be reset automatically. Without manual intervention, the terminal will download a new image on each reboot. Procedure: Force a Saltboot to redeploy image using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_redeploy.sls with content: saltboot: force_redeploy: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_redeploy Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After the terminal finishes booting, remove modifications made in /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls file.

Naming by FQDN 4. Assign Hostnames to Terminals Terminals can be named according to certain parameters, which can make it easier to match the physical device with its record in the Uyuni Web UI. Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, and HWType. Naming scheme can be selected in the Branch Network formula. For more information, see Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID 例: B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID 例: B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 例: B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: hwAddress: hwtype: Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. プロシージャ: クライアントでGPGキーを信頼する On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory.

If you are bootstrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) For more information about creating activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels クライアントの登録については、クライアントの登録を参照してください。 A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see Uyuni Proxy Registration. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script.

Create required system groups 3. Assign and configure formulas 4. Synchronize images To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies one or more POS images built In this example we consider architecture with shared network between POS terminals, branch server and Uyuni where branch server provides only PXE configuration and images. In this example we provide salt on kernel command line option and ftp in pillar for Saltboot service discovery. We assume to have one regular branch server with salt minion id branch1.mystore.com, which is equal to the branch server fully qualified domain name, and branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. There is already existing external DHCP and DNS service. DHCP service is correctly configured to PXE boot from branch server. Follow guide システムグループ to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign following formulas to the branch server: Branch Network Pxe Tftpd Procedure: Assign formulas to the branch server Select the Formulas tab for the system branch1.mystore.com You should see list of formulas in Configuration sub-tab In displayed list select Branch Network In displayed list select Pxe In displayed list select Tftpd Save assigned formulas by clicking Save in top right corner Procedure: Configure Branch Network formula Select Branch Network formula from branch server formula list Unselect Dedicated Nic check-box because we are not using dedicated network Keep the rest with default values In Terminal Naming and Identification section edit Branch Identification and set it to our branch id B0001 Save the formula Procedure: Configure Pxe formula Select Pxe formula from branch server formula list At the end of Kernel Command Line Parameters append MASTER=branch1.mystore.com Keep the rest with default values Save the formula Procedure: Configure Tftpd formula Select Tftpd formula from branch server formula list Set Internal Network Address to 0.0.0.0, this way tftp will be listening on any IPv4 Set TFTP base directory to /srv/saltboot Save the formula Next two formulas are group formulas. Make sure you are editing those formulas in their respective groups. Group formulas are visible as assigned also on system level, but editing them will create system specific setting instead of group setting. Assign Saltboot Group formula to the B0001 group and Saltboot formula to the HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 group.

To accomplish this, Cobbler uses a list of proxies specified in /etc/cobbler/settings. Due to its design, cobbler sync is not able to sync only the changed or recently added files. Instead, executing cobbler sync triggers a full sync of the /srv/tftpboot directory to all specified proxies configured in /etc/cobbler/settings. It is also influenced by the latency of the WAN connection between the involved systems. /var/log/cobbler/のログによると、同期のプロセスが完了するまでにかなりの時間がかかる場合があります。 たとえば、次の日時に開始したとします。 Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running python triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* そして、次の日時に終了したとします。 Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/post/* Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | shell triggers finished successfully 転送量は約1.8GBでした。 転送には30分ほどかかりました。 比較すると、/srv/tftbootと同じサイズの大きな単一ファイルのコピーは、数分以内に完了します。 Uyuniサーバとプロキシ間でファイルをコピーするためにrsyncベースのアプローチに切り替えると、転送時間と待機時間を短縮できる場合があります。 このタスクを実行するためのスクリプトは、https://suse.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/1i000000gLOd/a/1i000000ll5B/B2AmvIJN2_JsAyjTQzCVP_x5ioVgd0bYN9X9NpMugS8でダウンロードできます。 このスクリプトはコマンドラインオプションを受け入れません。 スクリプトを実行する前に、手動で編集し、SUMAHOSTNAME、 SUMAIP、およびSUMAPROXY1変数を正しく設定して、スクリプトが正しく機能するようにする必要があります。 スクリプトの個々の調整に利用可能なサポートはありません。 スクリプトと内部のコメントは、プロセスの概要と考慮すべきステップを提供することを目的としています。 さらにサポートが必要な場合は、SUSEコンサルティングにお問い合わせください。 スクリプトを使用した提案されるアプローチは、次の環境で役立ちます。 SUSE Manager ProxyシステムがWAN接続を介して接続されている。 /srv/tftbootに多数のディストリビューション用ファイルおよびクライアントPXEブートファイル(合計数千ファイル)が含まれている。 Any proxy in /etc/cobbler/settings has been disabled, otherwise Uyuni will continue to sync content to the proxies. #proxies: # - \"sumaproxy.sumaproxy.test\" # - \"sumaproxy2.sumaproxy.test\" プロシージャ: 新しい同期速度の分析 Uyuniと関連するシステム間のTCPトラフィックのダンプを取得します。 SUSE Managerサーバの場合: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh SUSE Managerプロキシの場合: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh これにより、分析を実行するのに十分な200のパッケージサイズのみがキャプチャされます。 プロキシと通信するためにUyuniが使用する各ネットワークインターフェイスにehtXを調整します。 最後に、さらにパッケージ数を削減するため、ssh通信はキャプチャされません。 Start a cobbler sync.

昇順にソートして開始し、ファイルの転送にかかった最小時間を確認します。 降順にソートして続行し、カーネルやinitrdの転送など、大きなファイルの最大値を確認します。 ポート4505と4506はSalt通信に使用されるため無視してください。 TCPdumpsの分析では、Uyuniサーバからプロキシへの、サイズが約1800バイトの小さなファイルの転送に約0.3秒かかったことを示しています。 大きなファイルは多くありませんでしたが、小さなファイルの数が多いため、転送されるファイルごとに新しいTCP接続が作成され、確立された接続数が多くなりました。 したがって、最小転送時間と必要な接続数(たとえば、約5000)がわかれば、転送時間全体の概算推定時間が得られます(5000 * 0.3 / 60 = 25分)。","title":"WAN接続を介したUyuniサーバとプロキシ間の長い同期時間に関するトラブルシューティング","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan","url":"/uyuni/administration/troubleshooting/tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan.html","titles":[]},"269":{"id":269,"text":"Uyuniサーバのホスト名をローカルで変更する場合は、Uyuniインストールが適切に機能しなくなります。

of Contents 1. クライアントでGPGキーを信頼する 1.1. ユーザ定義のGPGキー 1.2. ブートストラップスクリプトのGPGキー オペレーティング システムは、独自のGPGキーを直接信頼するか、少なくとも最小限のシステムでインストールされて出荷されます。 ただし、別のGPGキーで署名されたサードパーティのパッケージは手動で処理する必要があります。 クライアントは、GPGキーを信頼していなくても正常にブートストラップできます。 ただし、キーが信頼されるまで、新しいクライアントツールパッケージをインストールしたり、更新したりできません。 Salt clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. ソフトウェアチャンネルページのGPGキーのURLには、「空白」で区切られた複数のキーのURLを含めることができます。 ファイルURLの場合は、ソフトウェアチャンネルを使用する前に、GPGキーファイルをクライアントに配備する必要があります。 The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Debianベースのシステムはメタデータのみに署名するため、単一チャンネルに追加のキーを指定する必要はありません。 リポジトリメタデータの署名の「独自のGPGキーを使用する」で説明されているように、ユーザが独自のGPGキーを設定してメタデータに署名すると、そのキーの配備と信頼が自動的に実行されます。 Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. いくつかのpillarデータを提供し、SaltファイルシステムにGPGキーファイルを提供することで、自動的にクライアントに配備されます。 これらのキーは、RPMベースのオペレーティングシステムでは/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/に、Debianシステムでは/usr/share/keyrings/に配備されます。 キーを配備するクライアントのpillarキーcustom_gpgkeysを定義し、キーファイルの名前を一覧にします。 cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg さらに、Saltファイルシステムでは、gpgという名前のディレクトリを作成し、custom_gpgkeys pillarデータで指定された名前のGPGキーファイルを保存します。 ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg. 最後のステップでは、ソフトウェアチャンネルのGPGキーのURLフィールドにURLを追加します。 ソフトウェア 管理 チャンネルに移動し、変更するチャンネルを選択します。 ［GPGキーのURL］に値file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.keyを追加します。 プロシージャ: ブートストラップスクリプトを使用してクライアントでGPGキーを信頼する Uyuniサーバのコマンドプロンプトで、/srv/www/htdocs/pub/ディレクトリの内容を確認します。 このディレクトリには、使用できるすべての公開鍵が含まれています。 登録クライアントに割り当てるチャンネルに適用するキーをメモします。 関連するブートストラップスクリプトを開き、ORG_GPG_KEY=パラメータを見つけて、必要なキーを追加します。 次に例を示します。 uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key 以前保存したキーを削除する必要はありません。 クライアントのセキュリティにとってGPGキーを信頼することは重要です。 必要かつ信頼できるキーを決定するのは管理者のタスクです。 GPGキーが信頼されていない場合、ソフトウェアチャンネルをクライアントに割り当てることはできません。","title":"","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"trust_gpg","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/snippets/trust_gpg.html","titles":[{"text":"1. クライアントでGPGキーを信頼する","hash":"trust-gpg-keys-on-clients","id":1},{"text":"1.1. ユーザ定義のGPGキー","hash":"_ユーザ定義のgpgキー","id":2},{"text":"1.2. ブートストラップスクリプトのGPGキー","hash":"_ブートストラップスクリプトのgpgキー","id":3}]},"317":{"id":317,"text":"The Admin menu provides access to features for managing Uyuni configuration.

Configuration Channel Details Uyuni manages both central and local configuration channels and files. Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems, and is available for both traditional and Salt clients. For traditional clients, use local configuration management. Local configuration management allows you to specify overrides, and select configuration files that are not changed when the system is subscribed to a central channel. For Salt clients, use state channels. When you create a state channel, you can create or upload custom Salt states. For more information about custom Salt states, see Custom Salt States. Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel. If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the List/Remove Files page of that channel. If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the Configuration Channel Details Systems Subscribed Systems page for that channel. 概要 The Overview page of the Configuration Channel Details page is divided into several panels: チャネルプロパティ[管理] Edit the name, label, and description of the channel by clicking Edit Properties. チャンネル情報 Provides status information for the contents of the channel. Configuration Actions Provides access to the most common configuration tasks. For Salt clients, there is a link to edit the init.sls file. This panel allows you to deploy, compare, and add and create files. Some action are only availalble if you have files created and clients assigned to configuration channels. List/Remove Files This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel. You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels. Check the box next to files you want to manipulate, then click the action button at the bottom. Add Files The Add Files page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to Upload, Import, or Create configuration files to be included in the channel. Upload File To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the Upload Configuration File button. The Filename/Path field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed. You can set the Ownership via the user name and group name and the Permissions of the file when it is deployed. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure SELinux contexts to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type). If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro. For more information on using macros, see reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros. Import Files To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import. Then click Import Configuration Files. A sandbox icon () indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox. Files in a system’s sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable. Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel. Create File Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link to be included in the configuration channel. Deploy Files This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel. Deploy all files by clicking the Deploy All Files button or check selected files and click the Deploy Selected Files button. Select to which systems the files should be applied. All systems subscribed to this channel are listed. If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first. To deploy the files, click Confirm & Deploy to Selected Systems. システム Manage systems subscribed to the configuration channel with two subtabs: Subscribed Systems All systems subscribed to the current channel are displayed.

Setup spacecmd Credentials 2. spacecmd Quiet Mode 3. spacecmd Help The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help ): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Spacecmd caching problems This section provides troubleshooting solutions when working with spacecmd The support article associated with this issue may be located at https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7018627 Situation When creating a distribution with spacecmd it will automatically set localhost as the server name instead of the FQDN of SUSE Manager. This will result in the following kernel option being written: install=http://localhost/ks/dist/ Resolution Set the FQDN in $HOME/.spacecmd/config like the following: test:~/.spacecmd # cat config [spacecmd] server=test.mytest.env username=admin password=password nossl=0 Cause This problem may be experienced if $HOME/.spacecmd/config has been created and the server name option was set to localhost. When running spacecmd non-interactively, you must escape arguments passed to the command. Always put -- before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments. Additionally, make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted. An example of a well-formed spacecmd command: spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \\'My Channel\\' -l channel1 -a x86_64 The spacecmd command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed. Sometimes, this can result in a mismatch between the system name and the system ID.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block//queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block//queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients.

Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle.

Authentication Examples The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different authentication modes: Manual mode (default): API credentials must be explicitly provided for each server. Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2. Example Python Script for Relay Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # Authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate) client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds) # Perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Auto-Connect Authentication Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers. However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"488":{"id":488,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Tuning Reporting Jobs 4.2. report_db_batch_size 4.3. report_db_hub_workers The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral Uyuni Servers. The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Schema documentation can be found on the Left Navigation Bar → Help Report Database Schema. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Salt Client Onboarding Rate 2. Salt Clients and the RNG 3. Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys 4. Disabling the Salt Mine 5. Disable Unnecessary Taskomatic jobs 6. Swap and Monitoring 7. AES Key Rotation This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments. Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from Salt clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. There is no hard maximum number of supported systems. Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured. Large installations require standard Salt clients. These instructions cannot be used in environments using traditional clients or Salt SSH minions. There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information see Uyuniプロキシをパッケージからインストール. Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use Uyuni for Retail to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

Memory Usage Uyuni is designed by default to work on small and medium scale installations. For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters. Description The maximum number of HTTP requests served simultaneously by Apache httpd. Proxies, Web UI, and XMLRPC API clients each consume one. Requests exceeding the parameter will be queued and might result in timeouts. Tune when User count and proxy count increase significantly and this line appears in /var/log/apache2/error_log: […​] [mpm_prefork:error] [pid …​] AH00161: server reached MaxRequestWorkers setting, consider raising the MaxRequestWorkers setting. Value default 150 Value recommendation 150-500 Location /etc/apache2/server-tuning.conf, in the prefork.c section Example MaxClients = 200 After changing Immediately change ServerLimit and check maxThreads for possible adjustment.

Notes More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum number of threads in Tomcat dedicated to asynchronous operations Tune when Client count increases significantly Value default 5 Value recommendation 50 - 150 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.message_queue_thread_pool_size = 50 After changing Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size, as each thread consumes a PostgreSQL connection, starvation might happen if the allocated connection pool is insufficient. Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. Notes Incoming Salt events are handled in separate thread pool, see java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum number of minions concurrently executing a scheduled action. Tune when Client count reaches several thousands and actions are not executed quickly enough. Value default 200 Value recommendation 200-500 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_batch_size = 300 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information Salt Rate Limiting Description The maximum number of threads in Tomcat dedicated to handling of incoming Salt events. Tune when The number of queued Salt events grows. Typically, this can happen during onboarding of large number of minions with higher value of java.salt_presence_ping_timeout. The number of events can be queried by echo \"select count(*) from susesaltevent;\" | spacewalk-sql --select-mode-direct - Value default 8 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_event_thread_pool_size = 50 After changing Check the length of Salt event queue. Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size, as each thread consumes a PostgreSQL connection, starvation might happen if the allocated connection pool is insufficient. Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. More information man rhn.conf Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. This parameter sets the amount of time before a second command (find_job) is sent to the client to verify its presence. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 4 seconds Value recommendation 4-400 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_timeout = 40 After changing Large java.salt_presence_ping_timeout value can reduce overall throughput. This can be compensated by increasing java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information Salt Timeouts Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. After java.salt_presence_ping_timeout seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (find_job) is sent to the client for a final check. This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered offline. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 1 second Value recommendation 1-100 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 10 More information Salt Timeouts Description Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it. Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count increases significantly (more than 50), or more concurrent operations on channels are expected. Value default 2 Value recommendation 2-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers = 4 After changing Check taskomatic.java.maxmemory for adjustment, as every new thread will consume memory More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum amount of memory Taskomatic can use. Generation of metadata, especially for some OSs, can be memory-intensive, so this parameter might need raising depending on the managed OS mix. Tune when java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers increases, OSs are added to Uyuni (particularly Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu), or OutOfMemoryException errors appear in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log. Value default 4096 MiB Value recommendation 4096-16384 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.java.maxmemory = 8192 After changing Check memory usage. More information man rhn.conf Description The number of Taskomatic worker threads. Increasing this value allows Taskomatic to serve more clients in parallel. Tune when Client count increases significantly Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-200 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 100 After changing Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size and thread_pool for adjustment More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Cycle time for Taskomatic. Decreasing this value lowers the latency of Taskomatic. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 5000 ms Value recommendation 1000-5000 ms Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.scheduler.idleWaitTime = 1000 More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt clients as a result of actions being executed. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 1 Value recommendation 1-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.MinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 10 Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt SSH clients as a result of actions being executed.

Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.SSHMinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 40 Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections simultaneously available to both Tomcat and Taskomatic. If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving. Value default 20 Value recommendation 100 to 200, higher than the maximum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size + maxThreads and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example hibernate.c3p0.max_size = 100 After changing Check max_connections for adjustment. More information https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize Description The maximum amount of memory that the rhn-search service can use. Tune when Client count increases significantly, and OutOfMemoryException errors appear in journalctl -u rhn-search. Value default 512 MiB Value recommendation 512-4096 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example rhn-search.java.maxmemory = 4096 After changing Check memory usage. Description The amount of memory reserved for PostgreSQL shared buffers, which contain caches of database tables and index data. Tune when RAM changes Value default 25% of total RAM Value recommendation 25-40% of total RAM Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example shared_buffers = 8192MB After changing Check memory usage. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation 2 * hibernate.c3p0.max_size + apache MaxClients + 70, if less than 1000 Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-200 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 50 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Continuous Compliance checks Regardless of the public cloud service you use or the plan you choose, SUSE has you covered with support. Where you get support is dependent on whether you bring your own subscription (BYOS) or you use SUSE products on-demand (PAYG). BYOS BYOS instances are supported by SUSE under the terms of your SUSE subscription. For an overview of SUSE’s support subscriptions, refer to https://www.suse.com/support/.

To open a ticket for PAYG see: link:https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport Public Cloud Guide For more information on cloud products and support see the SUSE public cloud guide: SUSE Public Cloud Guide Public Cloud Information Tracker (Pint) The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images SUSE publishes and servers that are part of the SUSE operated update infrastructure. PINT is available at pint.suse.com and provided as an API and command-line tool with the python3-susepubliccloudinfo package from the Public Cloud Module repository. To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command supportconfig. The command-line tool is provided by the package supportutils which is installed by default. Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate supportconfig plug-ins. When supportconfig is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. supportconfig plug-ins are stored in the directory /usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/. The following procedure shows how to create a Supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly. Procedure: Creating a supportconfig archive Run supportconfig as root. Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list: Listing 1. Options: -E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E) Company name (-O) Your name (-N) Your phone number (-P) -i KEYWORDS, -F Limits the features to check. The placeholder KEYWORDS is a comma-separated list of case-sensitive keywords. Get a list of all keywords with supportconfig -F. Wait for the tool to complete the operation. The default archive location is /var/log, with the file name format being scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz To open a new support case for your cloud pay-as-you-go instance, you need to generate a supportconfig file and then follow the steps listed on: SUSE Customer Center Cloudsupport Serves billing data from Uyuni for the CSP-billing-adapter.

Register Clients to the SUSE Customer Center 2. Configure the Clients for Clustering 3. Create a Shared Storage Device 4. Download the SAP Installation Software 5. Configure Clients to Use Latest module.run 6. Install Additional Disks for HANA 7. Register Clients to the Server Your SAP cluster requires several client systems. Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP2/html/SLES-SAP-quick/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware. For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 一般的な要件. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see アクティベーションキー. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. In the Activation Key field, select the SLES for SAP activation key.

The server does not need to have the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 with SAP product installed. For more information about installing the Uyuni Server, see Uyuni 2023.1サーバのインストール. When the Uyuni Server is installed, set it up by running the yast2 susemanager_setup command from the command prompt. The setup script prompts you to complete additional details about your server, and give you the URL to use to access the Web UI. For more information about setup, see SUSE Managerのサーバ設定. You need to do some configuration to set up the Uyuni Web UI. In your browser, navigate to the URL of the server, and configure your administration access to the Web UI. For more information about setting up the Web UI, see Web Interface Setup. Now you can use the Web UI to prepare software channels and activation keys for your clients. On the Uyuni Server, add the appropriate SAP channels: From the Web UI, add SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP. Synchronize the Uyuni Server with the SUSE Customer Center. You can do this using the Web UI. Add the new channel to your activation key. To check if a channel has finished synchronizing navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and select the Products tab. This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. Software channels can be very large. The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours. When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.

Custom State to Trust a GPG Key 4. Apply a custom state at highstate You can create your own custom Salt states with Uyuni as centrally managed configuration channels. Custom states are stored as Salt state files on the Uyuni Server with a .sls extension. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create and edit custom Salt state files. You must create a state channel first, with an initial state named init.sls. The init.sls file is used to reference all other state files within the channel. The custom states that you create using the Web UI are stored on the Uyuni Server in the the /srv/susemanager/salt// directory. After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state.

Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click btn:Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit .sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2. Example: Package Management my_pkg_id: pkg.installed: - refresh: True - pkgs: - glibc - kernel-default - hello: 1.0-42 Listing 3. Example: Remote Command ip_forward-on: cmd.run: - name: echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - onlyif: - test `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 Listing 4. Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all SUSE public keys are also saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey- deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls. This short example maps the test state to the system group 12: # /srv/salt/top.sls base: 'group_ids:12': - match: pillar - test","title":"Custom Salt States","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-custom-states","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-custom-states.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This section describes how Salt is supported and set up as part of Uyuni Server. The main configuration file is /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf. Do not edit the /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf configuration file. This file belongs to the spacewalk-setup package and is marked as %config. When SUSE updates the spacewalk-setup package, the susemanager.conf file is overwritten, and any customization is lost. Instead, add your own configuration file to the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This prevents the update process from deleting your settings from the main susemanager.conf configuration file. Some settings from /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf that can help with finding configuration options: # Configure different file roots.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of Saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders. In the Configured Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.com). In the Type field, select master. Click Add item to add a second zone, and set these parameters for Zone 2: In the Name field, use the reverse zone for the configured IP range (for example: com.example.branch1).

Set Up a Branch Server Networking 1.1. Set Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN 1.2. Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network 2. Set up Branch Server Terminal Naming The Branch Network formula is used to configure the networking services required by the branch server, including DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration it is required to fill at least Branch Identification. This identifies Branch Server in Retail subsystem and is also used to better organize terminals with their respective branch servers. Procedure: Setting up a Branch Server Identification In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Terminal Naming section, enter the Branch Identification string. Click Save to save your changes. Apply the highstate.

Expression language 3. Writing Salt Formulas 4. Separate Data 5. Generated Pillar Data You can also write your own custom formulas, and make them available to your clients in the Uyuni Web UI. This section contains information about writing custom formulas, including formulas with forms. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directoy also contains an optional metadata.yml file that contains additional information about a formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt// Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata// All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata//form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a : null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py The process is executed like this: The suma_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (suma_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Example: gitfs_remotes: - https://example.com/myformulas/formula.git - gitlab@gitlab.example.com:universe/setup.git: - pubkey: /var/lib/salt/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab.pub - privkey: /var/lib/salt/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab - root: srv/salt - base: master ext_pillar List of external pillar interfaces. Salt can also serve pillar data from one or more git repositories. For syntax and options, also see the gitfs_remotes setting. Example: ext_pillar: - git: - master gitlab@gitlab.example.com:universe/setup.git: - root: srv/pillar - pubkey: /var/lib/salt/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab.pub - privkey: /var/lib/salt/.ssh/id_rsa_gitlab For more information, see: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/gitfs.html https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html","title":"The gitfs Fileserver Backend","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-gitfs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-gitfs.html","titles":[]},"522":{"id":522,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

For more information about Salt, see the Salt documentation at https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/contents.html. The current version of Salt in Uyuni is 3006. Throughout the Uyuni documentation, we use the term Salt clients to refer to Salt machines that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. This is to clearly differentiate them from traditional clients. In other documentation, and in some internal references, Salt clients are sometimes referred to as Salt minions instead.

Batching 2. Disabling the Salt Mine Salt is able to run commands in parallel on a large number of clients. This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C.","title":"Salt Rate Limiting","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-rate-limiting","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-rate-limiting.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Repository Access with a Proxy 11. Proxy Setup Salt SSH allows Salt commands and states to be issued directly over SSH. SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://suma-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the suma-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost suma-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to suma-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:suma-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to suma-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file= minion state.apply certs,` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time.","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see カスタムシステム情報. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys.

Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step. For more information on states, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html. For more Salt terminology, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/glossary.html.","title":"Terminology","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-terminology","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-terminology.html","titles":[]},"530":{"id":530,"text":"Table of Contents 1. General Salt timeouts 2. Presence Ping Timeouts 3. Salt SSH Clients (SSH Push) Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (presence_ping_timeout/presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here. Uyuni defines a timeout for SSH connections in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: # salt_ssh_connect_timeout = 180","title":"Salt timeouts","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-timeouts","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-timeouts.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Install the Yomi Formula 2. Install the PXE Image 3. Register Yomi in Cobbler 4. Example Salt Pillar Preparation 5. Monitor the Installation Yomi (yet one more installer) is an installer for SUSE and openSUSE operating systems. Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp:///pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring your own subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pay as you go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in パブリッククラウドの要件. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete setup in the Uyuni Web UI.

BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) Images Registering BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription. Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the registration process with Uyuni to ensure a smooth and error-free connection. If you have SCC credentials ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images. Do not register PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center. Only BYOS instances should be registered against the SUSE Customer Center. Registering PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved. PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update server when added to your cloud service provider Uyuni instance. For more information on using SUSE PAYG products such as SUSE Linux Enterprise in the public cloud see: SUSE Linux Enterprise Public Cloud Guide It is important to recognize that there is a difference between Pay-as-you-go connections and bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is also known as client registration.
