We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

We appreciate your questions and suggestions, which are vital in helping us improve. Submit feedback: https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs/issues Uyuni is a solution for organizations that require robust control over maintenance and package deployment on their servers. It enables you to manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up-to-date, with automated software management, asset management, and system provisioning. It also allows you to maintain a high level of security while effectively managing system life-cycle requirements. Uyuni uses Salt to provide event-driven configuration and management control. The Salt-master orchestrates tens of thousands of Salt clients (Uyuni clients) using remote execution. Uyuni offers seamless management of SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, Amazon Linux, AlmaLinux, and Raspberry Pi OS client systems. They can be on-premise, or on public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud or even multi-cloud environments.

Available Documentation","hash":"_available_documentation","id":2}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"You can manage actions on your clients in a number of different ways: You can schedule automated recurring actions to apply the highstate or an arbitrary set of custom states to clients on a specified schedule. You can apply recurring actions to individual clients, to all clients in a system group, or to an entire organization. You can set actions to be performed in a particular order by creating action chains. Action chains can be created and edited ahead of time, and scheduled to run at a time that suits you. You can also perform remote commands on one or more of your Salt clients. Remote commands allows you to issue commands to individual Salt clients, or to all clients that match a search term. You can apply recurring actions on individual Salt clients, to a system group, or to all clients in an organization. Currently, Uyuni supports the following action types as recurring actions: Highstate: Execute the highstate. Custom state: Execute a set of custom states. A custom state can be either an internal state provided by Uyuni, or a configuration channel created by a user. For more information about configuration channels, see Configuration Management. Procedure: Creating a New Recurring Action To apply a recurring action to an individual client, navigate to Systems, click the client to configure schedules for, and navigate to the Recurring Actions tab. To apply a recurring action to a system group, navigate to Systems System Groups, select the group to configure schedules for, and navigate to Recurring Actions tab. Click Create. Select an action type from the Action Type dropdown. Type a name for the new schedule. Choose the frequency of the recurring action: Hourly: Type the minute of each hour. For example, 15 runs the action at fifteen minutes past every hour. Daily: Select the time of each day. For example, 01:00 runs the action at 0100 every day, in the timezone of the Uyuni Server. Weekly: Select the day of the week and the time of the day, to execute the action every week at the specified time. Monthly: Select the day of the month and the time of the day, to execute the action every month at the specified time. Custom Quartz format: For more detailed options, enter a custom quartz string. For example, to run a recurring action at 0215 every Saturday of every month, enter: 0 15 2 ? * 7 OPTIONAL: Toggle the Test mode switch on to run the schedule in test mode. For actions of type Custom state, select the states from the list of available states and click Save Changes. This will only save the current state selection and not the schedule. In the next pane, drag and drop the selected states to put them in the execution order and click Confirm. Click Create Schedule to save, and see the complete list of existing schedules. Organization Administrators can set and edit recurring actions for all clients in the organization. Navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions to see all recurring actions that apply to the entire organization. Uyuni Administrators can set and edit recurring actions for all clients in all organizations. Navigate to Admin Organizations, select the organization to manage, and navigate to the States Recurring Actions tab. If you need to perform a number of sequential actions on your clients, you can create an action chain to ensure the order is respected. By default, most clients execute an action as soon as the command is issued. In some case, actions take a long time, which could mean that actions issued afterwards fail. For example, if you instruct a client to reboot, then issue a second command, the second action could fail because the reboot is still occurring. To ensure that actions occur in the correct order, use action chains. For transactional update systems, an action chain is executed inside a single snapshot, until there is a reboot action. This can cause some limitations. For more information, see Registering SLE Micro Clients and Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients. You can use action chains on all clients. Action chains can include any number of these actions, in any order: System Details Remote Command System Details Schedule System Reboot System Details States Highstate System Details Software Packages List/Remove System Details Software Packages Install System Details Software Packages Upgrade System Details Software Patches System Details Software Software Channels System Details Configuration Images Build Action chains are user-specific. To see the action chain in the Web UI, you must sign in as the same user who created the action chain. Procedure: Creating a New Action Chain In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the first action you want to perform in the action chain. For example, navigate to System Details for a client, and click Schedule System Reboot. Check the Add to field and select the action chain you want to add to: If this is your first action chain, select new action chain. If the action chain already exists, select it from the list. If you already have existing action chains, but you want to create a new action chain, start typing a name for the new action chain to create it. Confirm the action. The action is not performed immediately, it creates the new action chain, and a blue bar confirming this appears at the top of the screen. Continue adding actions to your action chain by checking the Add to field and selecting the name of the action chain to add them to. When you have finished adding actions, navigate to Schedule Action Chains and selecting the action chain from the list. Re-order actions by dragging them and dropping them into the correct position. Click the blue plus sign to see the clients an action is to be performed on. Click Save to save your changes. Schedule a time for your action chain to run, and click Save and Schedule. If you leave the page without clicking either Save or Save and Schedule all unsaved changes are discarded. If one action in an action chain fails, the action chain stops, and no further actions are executed. You can see scheduled actions from action chains by navigating to Schedule Pending Actions. You can configure clients to run commands remotely. This allows you to issue scripts or individual commands to a client, without having access to the client directly. This feature is automatically enabled on Salt clients, and you do not need to perform any further configuration. You can use this procedure to enable it manually, instead. Before you begin, ensure your client is subscribed to the appropriate tools child channel for its installed operating system. For more information about subscribing to software channels, see Software Channels. For transactional update systems, consider that a remote command is run inside a single snapshot. This can cause some limitations. For more information, see Registering SLE Micro Clients and Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients. Remote commands are run from the /tmp/ directory on the client. To ensure that remote commands work accurately, do not mount /tmp with the noexec option. For more information, see Troubleshooting Mounting /tmp with noexec. All commands run from the Remote Commands page are executed as root on clients. Wildcards can be used to run commands across any number of systems. Always take extra care to check your commands before issuing them. Procedure: Running Remote Commands on Salt Clients Navigate to Salt Remote Commands. In the first field, before the @ symbol, type the command you want to issue. In the second field, after the @ symbol, type the client you want to issue the command on. You can type the minion-id of an individual client, or you can use wildcards to target a range of clients. Click Find targets to check which clients you have targeted, and confirm that you have used the correct details. Click Run command to issue the command to the target clients.","title":"Actions","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"actions","url":"/uyuni/administration/actions.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The supported OS version for the Ansible Control Node is SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3, or later. Ansible software is also available for Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni for Retail Branch Server. For Control Nodes running operating systems other than SUSE Linux Enterprise, use Ansible shipped together with your distribution. Uyuni enables system administrators to operate their Ansible Control Nodes. Supported features are: inspection of inventory files discovery of playbooks execution of playbooks For more information: The inventory is a sorted list of managed Ansible nodes. For more information about organizing an inventory, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html. Playbooks are a way to describe how the inventory is to be managed. For more information about playbooks, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html. To use Ansible features, you need to register the already existing Ansible Control Node as a Salt client to the Uyuni Server. In the Web UI, on the System Details Properties page of the registered system, you must enable the Ansible Control Node system type of the Add-on System Types list. Enabling the Ansible Control Node system type ensures that the ansible package is installed on the system by adding it in the highstate and activates the Ansible features under the System Details Ansible tab. As the next step, configure the paths to your Ansible playbook directories and inventory files on the System Details Ansible Control Node page. As an inventory path, you can use the standard Ansible inventory path /etc/ansible/hosts. As a playbook directory, you can use any directory on the control node, where your playbook files are stored. A playbook directory either contains .yml files or subdirectories with .yml files. For installing and setting up an Ansible Control Node, see Setup Ansible Control Node. After defining an inventory path, you can use Uyuni to inspect its contents. Procedure: Inspecting an Inventory from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to System Details Ansible Inventories Click an inventory path to execute the inventory inspection on the Control Node in real-time. After defining a playbook directory, you can discover playbooks on the System Details Ansible Playbooks page. As with the inventory inspection, the playbook discovery operations run on the Control Node in real-time. You can schedule a playbook execution from the System Details Ansible Playbooks page. After selecting the playbook you wish to execute, you can select the inventory file for the execution from the Inventory Path drop-down menu of the Schedule Playbook Execution dialog. If you do not select any item, the default inventory configured in your Control Node will be used. The drop-down menu is populated with the inventories you defined in your Inventory paths and with inventories that have been locally discovered in your playbook directories. These are displayed as Custom Inventory items in the playbook details. You can also enter an arbitrary inventory path. Afterwards, you choose the time of the playbook execution or select an action chain. Eventually, Uyuni executes the playbook as an action on the Control Node. You can see the result of the operation on the action details page.","title":"Ansible Integration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"ansible-integration","url":"/uyuni/administration/ansible-integration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

To configure a client as the Ansible Control Node, the Ansible package must be installed on that system. Usually, the Ansible package should be obtained from the operating system vendor’s official repositories. For example, on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 and SP7, Ansible is available through the Systems Management Module. Procedure: Setting up Ansible Control Node on a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 or SP7 system In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Products, verify that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 x86_64 (or later) with the Systems Management Module and the required Python 3 Module are selected and synchronized. Deploy a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 (or later) client. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the Systems Overview page of the client. Select Software Software Channels and subscribe the client to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 x86_64 (or later SP), Systems Management Module and Python 3 Module channels. Select Details Properties of your client. From the Add-On System Types list enable Ansible Control Node and click Update Properties. Navigate to the client overview page, select State Highstate, and click Apply Highstate. Select the Events tab and verify the status of the highstate. If you want to install a newer Ansible on a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4 or SP5 client, you must enable the Python 3 Module. Newer versions of Ansible no longer support managing nodes with outdated Python versions. If a managed node still defaults to an older Python version, you may encounter connection errors or failures during playbook runs. To address this, user should upgrade Python on the managed node, if possible and set the correct Python interpreter in the Ansible inventory or configuration. Ansible Integration tools deploy a playbook as an inventory file. Create one inventory file for each operating system listed in Table 1. Procedure: Creating Ansible Inventory Files Create and add your hosts to an inventory file to be managed by Ansible. The default path for an Ansible inventory is /etc/ansible/hosts. Listing 1. Inventory Example client240.mgr.example.org client241.mgr.example.org client242.mgr.example.org client243.mgr.example.org ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/some_ssh_key [mygroup1] client241.mgr.example.org client242.mgr.example.org [mygroup2] client243.mgr.example.org [all:vars] ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key In the Uyuni Web UI, from the Ansible tab navigate to Ansible Control Node to add inventory files to the control node. Under the Playbook Directories section add /usr/share/scap-security-guide/ansible to the Add a Playbook Directories field and click Save. Under Inventory Files add your inventory file locations to the Add an Inventory file field and click Save. Listing 2. Examples /etc/ansible/sles15 /etc/ansible/sles12 /etc/ansible/centos7 For additional playbook examples, see https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples. Procedure: Establishing Communication with Ansible Nodes Create the SSH keys that you are using in your inventory. ssh-keygen -f /etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key Copy the generated SSH keys to the Ansible managed clients. Example: ssh-copy-id -i /etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key root@client240.mgr.example.org Declare the private key in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg as follows: private_key_file = /etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key Replace my_ansible_private_key with the name of the file containing the private key. Test that Ansible is working by executing the following commands from the control node: ansible all -m ping ansible mygroup1 -m ping ansible client240.mgr.example.org -m ping You may now run remediations.

You can check that your clients are up to date with all public security patches (CVEs), perform subscription matching, and use OpenSCAP to check for specification compliance. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Audit to perform auditing tasks. A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a fix for a publicly known security vulnerability. You must apply CVEs to your clients as soon as they become available. Each CVE contains an identification number, a description of the vulnerability, and links to further information. CVE identification numbers use the form CVE-YEAR-XXXX. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Audit CVE Audit to see a list of all clients and their current patch status. By default, the patch data is updated at 23:00 every day. We recommend that before you begin a CVE audit you refresh the data to ensure you have the latest patches. Procedure: Updating Patch Data In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Task Schedules and select the cve-server-channels-default schedule. Click cve-server-channels-bunch. Click Single Run Schedule to schedule the task. Allow the task to complete before continuing with the CVE audit. Procedure: Verifying Patch Status In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Audit CVE Audit. To check the patch status for a particular CVE, type the CVE identifier in the CVE Number field. Select the patch statuses you want to look for, or leave all statuses checked to look for all. Click Audit Servers to check all systems, or click Audit Images to check all images. For more information about the patch status icons used on this page, see CVE Audit. For each system, the Actions column provides information about what you need to do to address vulnerabilities. If applicable, a list of candidate channels or patches is also given. You can also assign systems to a System Set for further batch processing. You can use the Uyuni API to verify the patch status of your clients. Use the audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus API method. For more information about this method, see the Uyuni API Guide. In addition to retrieving CVE information from channel data, Uyuni now includes an experimental feature that fetches CVE details from OVAL files. This functionality is currently considered a Technology Preview. Users are encouraged to experiment with this feature and share feedback. However, it is not yet recommended for production use without thorough testing in a test environment. The CVE Audit operation relies on two primary data sources: channels and OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language). These two sources provide the metadata for conducting CVE audits, each serving a distinct purpose. Channels Channels include the updated software packages, including the patches, and provide insights into the essential patches required to address vulnerabilities. OVAL (Technology Preview) In contrast, OVAL data supply the information about vulnerabilities themselves, and packages that render a system vulnerable to a CVE. While it is possible to conduct CVE audits using only channels data, synchronizing OVAL data enhances the accuracy of the results, particularly in cases involving zero-day vulnerabilities or partially patched vulnerabilities. OVAL data is much more lightweight than channels data. For example, OVAL data for openSUSE Leap 15.4 is around 50 MB. Having synced OVAL data only, you can already perform CVE audits and check if your systems are vulnerable or not to a CVE, but you can’t apply patches since they come from channels. Key characteristics of the OVAL feature include: Disabled by default: The feature is turned off by default and must be explicitly enabled by the user by updating the configuration file rhn.conf and restarting relevant services. Reversible: If any issues arise, users can revert back to the standard channel-based CVE audit. Performance considerations: While initial testing has been conducted, there are still concerns regarding performance, and further optimizations may be needed. OVAL data is updated at 23:00 every day by default. We recommend that before you begin a CVE audit you refresh the data to ensure you have the latest vulnerabilities metadata. Procedure: Enabling OVAL Data Support Add or modify the following setting in rhn.conf: java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=true Restart the Tomcat and Taskomatic services: systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic If you encounter issues and need to revert to the default behavior, disable the feature by setting: Procedure: Disabling OVAL Data Support Add or modify the following setting in rhn.conf: java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=false Restart the Tomcat and Taskomatic services: systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic Procedure: Updating OVAL Data In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Task Schedules and select the oval-data-sync-default schedule. Click oval-data-sync-bunch. Click Single Run Schedule to schedule the task. Allow the task to complete before continuing with the CVE audit. To be able to accurately identify what vulnerabilities apply to a certain client, we need to identify the operating system product that client uses. To do that, we collect the CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) of the client as a salt grain, then we save it to the database. The CPE of newly registered clients will be automatically collected and saved to the database. However, for existing clients, it is necessary to execute the Update Packages List action at least once. Procedure: Update Packages List In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List All and select a client. Then go to the Software tab and select the Packages sub-tab. Click Update Packages List to update packages and collect the CPE of client. To ensure the integrity and currency of the OVAL data, Uyuni exclusively consumes OVAL data from the official maintainers of every product. Below, you can find the list of OVAL data sources. Table 1. OVAL Sources Product Source URL openSUSE Leap https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval openSUSE Leap Micro SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro RedHat Enterprise Linux https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2 Debian https://www.debian.org/security/oval Ubuntu https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval OVAL metadata is used in CVE auditing for only a subset of clients, namely, clients that use openSUSE Leap, SUSE enterprise products, RHEL, Debian or Ubuntu. This is due to the absence of OVAL vulnerability definitions metadata for the other products. The CVE status of clients is usually either affected, not affected, or patched. These statuses are based only on the information that is available to Uyuni. Within Uyuni, these definitions apply: System affected by a certain vulnerability A system which has an installed package with version lower than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. System not affected by a certain vulnerability A system which has no installed package that is also in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. System patched for a certain vulnerability A system which has an installed package with version equal to or greater than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. Relevant patch A patch known by Uyuni in a relevant channel. Relevant channel A channel managed by Uyuni, which is either assigned to the system, the original of a cloned channel which is assigned to the system, a channel linked to a product which is installed on the system or a past or future service pack channel for the system. Because of the definitions used within Uyuni, CVE audit results might be incorrect in some circumstances. For example, unmanaged channels, unmanaged packages, or non-compliant systems might report incorrectly.","title":"Auditing","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auditing","url":"/uyuni/administration/auditing.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Start by installing the Keycloak IdP, then setting up the Uyuni Server. Then you can add the endpoints as Keycloak clients, and create users. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only. SUSE does not recommend or support third-party identity service providers, and is not affiliated with Keycloak. For Keycloak support, see https://www.keycloak.org/. You can install Keycloak directly on your machine, or run it in a container. In this example, we run Keycloak in a Podman container. For more information about installing Keycloak, see the Keycloak documentation at https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started. Procedure: Setting Up the Identity Service Provider Install Keycloak in a Podman container, according to the Keycloak documentation.

Keycloak refers to endpoints as clients. Procedure: Adding Endpoints as Clients In the Keycloak Web UI, create a new client using these details: In the Client type field, select SAML. In the Client ID field, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.entityid. For example, https://<FQDN_MLM>/rhn/manager/sso/metadata. In the Settings tab, fine-tune the client using these details: Toggle the Sign assertions switch to On. In the Signature algorithm field, select RSA_SHA1. In the SAML Signature Key Name field, select Key ID. In the Keys tab: Set Client signature required to Off. In the Advanced tab, in the Fine Grain SAML Endpoint Configuration section, add the two endpoints using these details: In both the Assertion Consumer Service fields, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url. For example, https://<FQDN_MLM>/rhn/manager/sso/acs. In both the Logout Service fields, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.single_logout_service.url. For example, https://<FQDN_MLM>/rhn/manager/sso/sls. When you have added the endpoints as clients, you can configure the client scope, and map the users between Keycloak and Uyuni. Procedure: Configuring Client Scope and Mappers In the Keycloak Web UI, navigate to the Clients Client scopes tab and assign role_list as the default client scope. Navigate to the Client_scopes Mappers tab and add a mapper for user attribute uid, using the default values. This SAML attribute is expected by Uyuni. Navigate to the Client_scopes Mappers and click on role_list mapper. Set Single Role Attribute to On. Navigate to the Users Admin section and create an administrative user. This user does not need to match the Uyuni administrative user. Navigate to the Users Role mappings tab, add an attribute named uid with a value that matches the username of the Uyuni administrative user. Navigate to the Users Credentials tab, and set the same password as used by the Uyuni administrative user. . Save your changes. When you have completed the configuration, you can test that the installation is working as expected. Restart the Uyuni Server to pick up your changes, and navigate to the Uyuni Web UI. If your installation is working correctly, you are redirected to the Keycloak SSO page, where you can authenticate successfully.","title":"Example SSO Implementation","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auth-methods-sso-example","url":"/uyuni/administration/auth-methods-sso-example.html","titles":[]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Uyuni supports single sign-on (SSO) by implementing the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2 protocol. Single sign-on is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data. A SAML identity service provider (IdP) provides authentication and authorization services to service providers (SP), such as Uyuni. Uyuni exposes three endpoints which must be enabled for single sign-on. SSO in Uyuni supports: Log in with SSO. Log out with service provider-initiated single logout (SLO), and Identity service provider single logout service (SLS). Assertion and nameId encryption. Assertion signatures. Message signatures with AuthNRequest, LogoutRequest, and LogoutResponses. Enable an Assertion consumer service endpoint. Enable a single logout service endpoint. Publish the SP metadata (which can be signed). SSO in Uyuni does not support: Product choosing and implementation for the identity service provider (IdP). SAML support for other products (check with the respective product documentation). For an example implementation of SSO, see Example SSO Implementation. If you change from the default authentication method to single sign-on, the new SSO credentials apply only to the Web UI. Client tools such as mgr-sync or spacecmd continue to work with the default authentication method only. Before you begin, you need to have configured an external identity service provider with these parameters. Check your IdP documentation for instructions. The mapping between the IdP user and the Uyuni user is specified in a SAML:Attribute. The SAML:Attribute must be configured in the IdP and must be passed to Uyuni in the SAML authentication. The attribute must be named uid and must contain the Uyuni user mapped to it after login. The Uyuni must be created before you activate single sign-on. You need these endpoints: Assertion consumer service (or ACS): an endpoint to accept SAML messages to establish a session into the Service Provider. The endpoint for ACS in Uyuni is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/acs Single logout service (or SLS): an endpoint to initiate a logout request from the IdP. The endpoint for SLS in Uyuni is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/sls Metadata: an endpoint to retrieve Uyuni metadata for SAML. The endpoint for metadata in Uyuni is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/metadata After the authentication with the IdP using the user orgadmin is successful, you are logged in to Uyuni as the orgadmin user, provided that the orgadmin user exists in Uyuni. Using SSO is mutually exclusive with other types of authentication: it is either enabled or disabled. SSO is disabled by default. Use mgrctl term before running steps inside the server container. Procedure: Enabling SSO If your users do not yet exist in Uyuni, create them first. Edit /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and add this line at the end of the file: java.sso = true Find the parameters you want to customize in /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf. Insert the parameters you want to customize into /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and prefix them with java.sso. For example, in /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf find: onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs To customize it, create the corresponding option in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf by prefixing the option name with java.sso.: java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs To find all the occurrences you need to change, search in the file for the placeholders YOUR-PRODUCT and YOUR-IDP-ENTITY.

With the mgradm backup tool you create Uyuni backups. Information about restoring from your backups in the case of a system failure completes this chapter. Because Uyuni relies on a database as well as the installed program and configurations, it is important to back up all components of your installation. Back up your Uyuni installation regularly to prevent data loss and enable quick recovery. Regardless of the backup method you use, you must have available at least three times the amount of space your current installation uses. Running out of space can result in backups failing, so check this often. smdba backup tool is deprecated in Uyuni. The most comprehensive method for backing up your Uyuni installation is to use mgradm backup create command. This can save you time in administering your backup, and can be faster to reinstall and re-synchronize in the case of failure. However, this method requires significant disk space and could take a long time to perform the backup. mgradm backup create command performs backup to a directory. This directory can be both local or mounted remote storage. mgradm backup create command allows various customizations of the content of the backup. For all available options, see mgradm backup create --help. A full backup of the Uyuni consists of backing up the following components: Uyuni volumes database volumes podman network configuration podman secrets Uyuni systemd services Uyuni container images The Uyuni service is automatically stopped for the time it takes to create a full backup. The downtime can be significant. After backup is done, service is automatically restarted. Procedure: Creating Full Backup with mgradm backup create On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. mgradm backup create tool allows creating partial backups. It is possible to skip individual or all volumes, skip database backup and images. Particularly when database backup is skipped, backup is created without stopping Uyuni services and can act as a one phase in two phase backup procedure. Partial backup cannot guarantee backup/restore consistency. Procedure: Creating Partial Backup by Skipping Database Backup On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create --skipdatabase $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Procedure: Creating Partial Backup by Skipping a Volume. On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create --skipvolumes $volumes $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Replace $volumes by the name of the volume name to be included in the backup, or by a comma separated list of volumes to be included. Use all to skip all volumes, except database volumes. mgradm backup command uses internal list of Uyuni volumes. If additional volumes were configured during the installation, or additional volumes should be added to the backup, they need to be specified using --extravolumes $volumes. Procedure: Creating Backup with Additional Custom Volume On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create --extravolumes $volume $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Replace $volumes by the name of the volume name to be included in the backup. or by a comma separated list of volumes to be included. Procedure: Performing a Manual Database Backup Allocate permanent storage space for your backup. At the command prompt of the Uyuni container host, as root, use: mgradm backup create --skipvolumes all --skipconfig --skipimages $path Restoring Uyuni from the existing backup will enumerate backup for volumes, images and configuration to restore. Unlike in backup create scenario, restore operation is not using an internal volume list, but automatically detect every volume or image present in the backup. After the list of items to restore is gathered, presence and integrity check is performed. Presence check ensures backup restore will not accidentally overwrite existing volumes, image or configurations. Integrity check is done by computing backup items checksums. After both checks are successful, actual backup restore is performed. Uyuni services are not automatically started after backup restore is finished. Procedure: Restoring from an Existing Backup On the container host, as root, re-deploy the Uyuni Server with: mgradm stop mgradm backup restore $path mgradm start Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Verification of the backup can be a time-consuming operation. If backup integrity is ensured by other means, verification can be skipped by using --skipverify option. If for some reason it is needed to skip restoring a volume present in the backup, --skipvolumes $volumes option can be used. Procedure: Recommended Steps after Uyuni Restore Re-synchronize your Uyuni repositories using either the Uyuni Web UI, or with the mgr-sync tool at the command prompt in the container. You can choose to re-register your product, or skip the registration and SSL certificate generation sections. On the container host, check whether you need to restore /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/. If /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/ was not in your backup, you need to restore it. If the source repository is available, you can restore `/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/ with a complete channel synchronization: mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels Schedule the re-creation of search indexes next time the rhn-search service is started. This command produces only debug messages, it does not produce error messages. On the container host, enter: mgrctl exec -ti -- rhn-search cleanindex","title":"Backup and Restore","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"backup-restore","url":"/uyuni/administration/backup-restore.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In Uyuni, channels are grouped into base and child channels, with base channels grouped by operating system type, version, and architecture, and child channels being compatible with their related base channel. When a client has been assigned to a base channel, it is only possible for that system to install the related child channels. Organizing channels in this way ensures that only compatible packages are installed on each system. Software channels use repositories to provide packages. The channels mirror the repositories in Uyuni, and the package names and other data are stored in the Uyuni database. You can have any number of repositories associated with a channel. The software from those repositories can then be installed on clients by subscribing the client to the appropriate channel. Clients can only be assigned to one base channel. The client can then install or update packages from the repositories associated with that base channel and any of its child channels. Uyuni provides a number of vendor channels, which provide you everything you need to run Uyuni. Uyuni Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority, which gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels. If you want to use your own packages in your environment, you can create custom channels. Custom channels can be used as a base channel, or you can associate them with a vendor base channel. For more on creating custom channels, see Custom Channels. By default, any user can subscribe channels to a system. You can implement restrictions on the channel using the Web UI. Procedure: Restricting Subscriber Access to a Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Channel List, and select the channel to edit. Locate the Per-User Subscription Restrictions section and check Only selected users within your organization may subscribe to this channel. Click Update to save the changes. Navigate to the Subscribers tab and select or deselect users as required. You can delete vendor software channels from the command prompt. Procedure: Deleting Vendor Channels On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, list the available vendor channels, and make a note of the channel you want to delete: mgr-sync list channels Delete the channel: spacewalk-remove-channel -c <channel-name> For information about deleting custom channels, see Custom Channels.","title":"Channel Management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"channel-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/channel-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The trustworthiness of the TEE is checked with the attestation process. Uyuni can be used as an attestation server for the systems registered to it. It generates a report page for the systems which run in this mode. These systems need to be attested and checked on regular base. The history of the past checks is also stored and available per request. Confidential Computing Attestation depends on the used hardware and environment where the attested systems are running on. Confidential Computing Attestation is only available on x86_64 architecture. Confidential Computing can be set up in an environment with the following characteristics: Attested system (virtual machine) is SLES15 SP6 and bootstrapped to Uyuni Hardware must have AMD EPYC Milan CPU or AMD EPYC Genoa CPU BIOS must be configured to allow Confidential Computing attestation Host OS and the virtualization software (KVM and libvirt) must support Confidential Computing. SLES15 SP6 has Confidential Computing attestation as technology preview. Uyuni has Confidential Computing attestation as technology preview. Secure boot is attested. However, currently KVM secure boot and SNP Guest are not working together.

Use these examples to build your own personalized implementation. An example project for a monthly patch cycle consists of: Creating a By Date filter Adding the filter to the project Applying the filter to a new project build Excluding a patch from the project Including a patch in the project The By Date filter excludes all patches released after a specified date. This filter is useful for your content lifecycle projects that follow a monthly patch cycle. Procedure: Creating the By Date Filter In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, type a name for your filter. For example, Exclude patches by date. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Issue date). In the Matcher field, later or equal is autoselected. Select the date and time. Click Save. Procedure: Adding a Filter to a Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select a project from the list. Click Attach/Detach Filters link to see all available filters Select the new Exclude patches by date filter. Click Save. The new filter is added to your filter list, but it still needs to be applied to the project. To apply the filter you need to build the first environment. Procedure: Using the Filter Click Build to build the first environment. OPTIONAL: Add a message. You can use messages to help track the build history. Check that the filter has worked correctly by using the new channels on a test server. Click Promote to move the content to the next environment. The build takes longer if you have a large number of filters, or they are very complex. Tests may help you discover issues. When an issue is found, exclude the problem patch released before the by date filter. Procedure: Excluding a Patch In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, enter a name for the filter. For example, Exclude openjdk patch. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Advisory Name). In the Matcher field, select equals. In the Advisory Name field, type a name for the advisory. For example, SUSE-15-2019-1807. Click Save. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters link, select Exclude openjdk patch, and click Save. When you rebuild the project with the Build button, the new filter is used together with the by date filter we added before. In this example, you have received a security alert. An important security patch was released several days after the first of the month you are currently working on. The name of the new patch is SUSE-15-2019-2071. You need to include this new patch into your environment. The Allow filters rule overrides the exclude function of the Deny filter rule. For more information, see Content Lifecycle Management. Procedure: Including a Patch in a Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, type a name for the filter. For example, Include kernel security fix. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Advisory Name). In the Matcher field, select equals. In the Advisory Name field, type SUSE-15-2019-2071, and check Allow. Click Save to store the filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project from the list. Click Attach/Detach Filters, and select Include kernel security patch. Click Save. Click Build to rebuild the environment. When a monthly patch cycle is complete, you can update the patch cycle for the next month. Procedure: Updating a Monthly Patch Cycle In the by date field, change the date of the filter to the next month. Alternatively, create a new filter and change the assignment to the project. Check if the exclude filter for SUSE-15-2019-1807 can be detached from the project. There may be a new patch available to fix this issue. Detach the allow filter you added previously. The patch is included by default. Rebuild the project to create a new environment with patches for the next month. This section covers setting up filters to create environments for live patching. When you are preparing to use live patching, there are some important considerations Only ever use one kernel version on your systems. The live patching packages are installed with a specific kernel. Live patching updates are shipped as one patch. Each kernel patch that begins a new series of live patching kernels displays the required reboot flag. These kernel patches come with live patching tools. When you have installed them, you need to reboot the system at least once before the next year. Only install live patch updates that match the installed kernel version. Live patches are provided as stand-alone patches. You must exclude all regular kernel patches with higher kernel version than the currently installed one. In this example you update your systems with the SUSE-15-2019-1244 patch. This patch contains kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64. You need to exclude all patches which contain a higher version of kernel-default and kernel-default-base. Procedure: Excluding Packages with a Higher Kernel Version In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters, and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, type a name for your filter. For example, Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Contains Package). In the Matcher field, select version greater than. In the Package Name field, type kernel-default. Leave the the Epoch field empty. In the Version field, type 4.12.14. In the Release field, type 150.17.1. Click Save to store the filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters. Select Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1, and click Save. You need to repeat this procedure for the kernel-default-base package. When you click Build, a new environment is created. The new environment contains all the kernel patches up to the version you installed. All kernel patches with higher kernel versions are removed. Live patching kernels remain available as long as they are not the first in a series. This procedure can be automated using a filter template. For more information on how to apply a live patching filter template, see administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templates. Live Patching for a specific kernel version is only available for one year. After one year you must update the kernel on your systems. Execute these environment changes: Procedure: Switch to a New Kernel Version Decide which kernel version to upgrade to. For example: 4.12.14-150.32.1 Create a new kernel version Filter. Detach the previous filter Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1 and attach the new filter. Click Build to rebuild the environment. The new environment contains all kernel patches up to the new kernel version you selected. Systems using these channels have the kernel update available for installation. You need to reboot systems after they have performed the upgrade. The new kernel remains valid for one year. All packages installed during the year match the current live patching kernel filter. In a content lifecycle management project, you can use the AppStream filter to transform modular repositories into regular repositories. It does this by keeping the packages in the repository and stripping away the module metadata. The resulting repository can be used in Uyuni in the same way as a regular repository. AppStream repositories are natively supported throughout the Web UI. Therefore, this process is not mandatory to work with AppStream repositories. The AppStream filter selects a single module stream to be included in the target repository. You can add multiple filters to select multiple module streams. If you do not use an AppStream filter in your CLM project, the module metadata in the modular sources remains intact, and the target repositories contain the same module metadata. As long as at least one AppStream filter is enabled in the CLM project, all target repositories are transformed into regular repositories. In some cases, you might wish to build regular repositories without having to include packages from any module. To do so, add an AppStream filter using the matcher none (disable modularity). This will disable all the modules in the target repository. This is especially useful for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 clients, where the default versions of most modules are already included in the AppStream repository as regular packages. To use the AppStream filter, you need a CLM project with a modular repository such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStreams. Ensure that you included the module you need as a source before you begin. Procedure: Using AppStream Filters In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 CLM project. Ensure that you have included the AppStream channels for your project. Click Create Filter and use these parameters: In the Filter Name field, type a name for the new filter. In the Filter Type field, select Module (Stream). In the Matcher field, select equals. In the Module Name field, type a module name. For example, postgresql. In the Stream field, type the name of the desired stream. For example, 10. If you leave this field blank, the default stream for the module is selected. Click Save to create the new filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters, select your new AppStream filter, and click Save. You can use the browse function in the Create/Edit Filter form to select a module from a list of available module streams for a modular channel. Procedure: Browsing Available Module Streams In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 CLM project. Ensure that you have included the AppStream channels for your project. Click Create Filter and use these parameters: In the Filter Name field, type a name for the new filter. In the Filter Type field, select Module (Stream). In the Matcher field, select equals. Click Browse available modules to see all modular channels. Select a channel to browse the modules and streams: In the Module Name field, start typing a module name to search, or select from the list. In the Stream field, start typing a stream name to search, or select from the list. Channel selection is only for browsing modules. The selected channel is not be saved with the filter, and does not affect the CLM process in any way. You can create additional AppStream filters for any other module stream to be included in the target repository. Any module streams that the selected stream depends on is automatically included. Be careful not to specify conflicting, incompatible, or missing module streams. For example, selecting two streams from the same module is invalid. Procedure: Disabling Modularity In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 CLM project. Ensure that you have included the AppStream channels for your project. Click Create Filter and use these parameters: In the Filter Name field, type a name for the new filter. In the Filter Type field, select Module (Stream). In the Matcher field, select none (disable modularity). Click Save to create the new filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters, select your new AppStream filter, and click Save. This will effectively remove the module metadata from the target repository, excluding any package that belongs to a module. When you build your CLM project using the Build button in the Web UI, the target repository is a regular repository without any modules, that contains packages from the selected module streams. Disabling modularity altogether in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 projects might result in a faulty environment as some modules are essential for healthy operation in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.","title":"Content Lifecycle Management Examples","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This is especially useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. While you cannot directly modify vendor channels, you can clone them and then modify the clones by adding or removing packages and custom patches. You can assign these cloned channels to test clients to ensure they work as expected. By default, cloned vendor channels match the original vendor channel and automatically select the dependencies. You can disable the automatic selection for cloned channels by adding the following option in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: java.cloned_channel_auto_selection = false Then, when all tests pass, you can promote the cloned channels to production servers. This is achieved through a series of environments that your software channels can move through on their lifecycle. Most environment lifecycles include at least test and production environments, but you can have as many environments as you require. This section covers the basic content lifecycle procedures, and the filters available. For more specific examples, see Content Lifecycle Management Examples. To set up a content lifecycle, you need to begin with a project. The project defines the software channel sources, the filters used to find packages, and the build environments. Procedure: Creating a Content Lifecycle Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and click Create Project. In the Label field, enter a label for your project. The Label field only accepts lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your project. Click the Create button to create your project and return to the project page. Click Attach/Detach Sources. In the Sources dialog, select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. The software channels you selected should now be showing. Click Attach/Detach Filters. In the Filters dialog, select the filters you want to attach to the project. To create a new filter, click Create new Filter. Click Add Environment. In the Environment Lifecycle dialog, give the first environment a name, a label, and a description, and click Save. The Label field only accepts lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores. Continue creating environments until you have all the environments for your lifecycle completed. You can select the order of the environments in the lifecycle by selecting an environment in the Insert before field when you create it. Uyuni allows you to create various types of filters to control the content used for building the project. Filters allow you to select which packages are included or excluded from the build. For example, you could exclude all kernel packages, or include only specific releases of some packages. The supported filters are: package filtering by name by name, epoch, version, release, and architecture by provided name patch filtering by advisory name by advisory type by synopsis by keyword by date by affected package module by stream Package dependencies are not resolved during content filtering. There are multiple matchers you can use with the filter. Which ones are available depends on the filter type you choose. The available matchers are: contains matches (must take the form of a regular expression) equals greater greater or equal lower or equal lower later or equal Each filter has a rule parameter that can be set to either Allow or Deny. The filters are processed like this: If a package or patch satisfies a Deny filter, it is excluded from the result. If a package or patch satisfies an Allow filter, it is included in the result (even if it was excluded by a Deny filter). Allow filters for packages only operate on package filters and Allow filters for patches only operate on patch filters. This means with a package filter you cannot add packages back in that were filtered out through patch filters or vice versa for patches that where filtered out through package filters. This behavior is useful when you want to exclude large number of packages or patches using a general Deny filter and \"cherry-pick\" specific packages or patches with specific Allow filters. Content filters are global in your organization and can be shared between projects. If your project already contains built sources, when you add an environment it is automatically populated with the existing content. Content is drawn from the previous environment of the cycle if it had one. If there is no previous environment, it is left empty until the project sources are built again. To help with creating filters for some common scenarios, Uyuni offers filter templates. When applied, these templates help creating a set of filters in advance, tailored for a specific use case. This section describes available templates and their usages. In a project that contains live patching, regular future kernel packages must be excluded so that only live patch packages are offered as updates to clients. On the other hand, already installed regular kernel packages must still be included to keep system integrity. When applied, this template creates three filters required to achieve this behavior: Allow patches that contain kernel-default package equal to a base kernel version Deny patches that contain reboot_suggested keyword Deny patches that contain a package which provides the name installhint(reboot-needed) For more information on how to set up a live patching project, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version. Procedure: Applying the Template In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters, and click Create Filter. In the dialog, click Use a template. The inputs will change accordingly. In the Prefix field, type a name prefix. This value will be prepended to the name of every individual filter created by the template. If the template is being applied in the context of a project, this field will be prefilled with the project label. In the Template field, select Live patching based on a SUSE product. In the Product field, select the product you wish to set up live patching for. In the Kernel field, select a kernel version from the list of versions available in the selected product. The filter to deny the later regular kernel patches will be based on this version. Click Save to create the filters. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters. Select the three filters that have the specified prefix, and click Save. When you want to set up a live patching project based on a kernel version installed in a specific registered system, you can use the \"live patching based on a system\" template. When applied, this template creates three filters required to achieve this behavior: Allow patches that contain kernel-default package equal to a base kernel version Deny patches that contain reboot_suggested keyword Deny patches that contain a package which provides the name installhint(reboot-needed) For more information on how to set up a live patching project, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version. Procedure: Applying the Template In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters, and click Create Filter. In the dialog, click Use a template. The inputs will change accordingly. In the Prefix field, type a name prefix. This value will be prepended to the name of every filter created by the template. If the template is being applied in the context of a project, this field will be prefilled with the project label. In the Template field, select Live patching based on a specific system. In the System field, select a system from the list, or start typing a system name to narrow down the options. In the Kernel field, select a kernel version from the list of versions installed in the selected system. The filter to deny the later regular kernel patches will be based on this version. Click Save to create the filters. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters. Select the three filters that have the specified prefix, and click Save. When you want to have all the modules available in a modular repository included in your project, you can automatically add them using this filter template. When applied, this template creates an AppStream filter per module and its default stream. If this process is done from the project’s page, the filters are added to the project automatically. Otherwise, the created filters can be listed in Content Lifecycle Filters and be added to any project as needed. Each individual filter can be edited to select a different module stream, or removed altogether to exclude that module from the target repositories. Because not all module streams are compatible with each other, changing individual streams may prevent successful resolution of modular dependencies. When this happens, the filters pane in the project details page will show an error describing the problem, and the build button will be disabled until all the module selections are compatible. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, modules do not have any defined default streams. Therefore, using this template with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 sources will have no effect. For more information on how to set up AppStream repositories with content lifecycle management, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters. Procedure: Applying the Template In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select your project. In the Filters section, click Attach/Detach Filters, and then click Create New Filter. In the dialog, click Use a template. The inputs will change accordingly. In the Prefix field, type a name prefix. This value will be prepended to the name of every filter created by the template. If the template is being applied in the context of a project, this field will be prefilled with the project label. In the Template field, select AppStream modules with defaults. In the Channel field, select a modular channel to get the modules from. In this dropdown, only the modular channels are displayed. Click Save to create the filters. Scroll to the Filters section to see the newly attached AppStream filters. You can edit/remove any individual filter to tailor the project to your needs. When you have created your project, defined environments, and attached sources and filters, you can build the project for the first time. Building applies filters to the attached sources and clones them to the first environment in the project. You can use the same vendor channels as sources for multiple content projects. In this case, Uyuni does not create new patch clones for each cloned channel. Instead, a single patch clone is shared between all of your cloned channels. This can cause problems if a vendor modifies a patch; for example, if the patch is retracted, or the packages within the patch are changed. When you build one of the content projects, all the channels that share the cloned patch are synchronized with the original by default, even if the channels are in other environments of your content project, or other content project channels in your organization. You can change this behavior by turning off automatic patch synchronization in your organization settings. To manually synchronize the patch later for all channels sharing the patch, navigate to Software Manage Channels, click the channel you want to synchronize and navigate to the Sync subtab. Even manual patch synchronization affects all organization channels sharing the patch. Procedure: Building a Content Lifecycle Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to build. Make sure you have the environment available before building the project. Review the attached sources and filters, and click Build. Provide a version message to describe the changes or updates in this build. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section. After the build is finished, the environment version is increased by one and the built sources, such as software channels, can be assigned to your clients. When the project has been built, the built sources can be sequentially promoted to the environments. Procedure: Promoting Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section. When you build and promote content lifecycle projects, Uyuni creates a tree of software channels. To add clients to the environment, assign the base and child software channels to your client using Software Software Channels in the System Details page for the client. Newly added cloned channels are not assigned to clients automatically. If you add or promote sources you need to manually check and update your channel assignments. Automatic assignment is intended to be added to Uyuni in a future version.","title":"Content Lifecycle Management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This allows package installation to begin as soon as it is scheduled, which can reduce the amount of time required for a maintenance window. You can manage content staging across your entire organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations to see a list of available organizations. Click the name of an organization, and check the Enable Staging Contents box to allow clients in this organization to stage package data. You must be logged in as the Uyuni administrator to create and manage organizations. You can also enable staging at the command prompt by editing /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date, and adding or editing these lines: stagingContent=1 stagingContentWindow=24 The stagingContentWindow parameter is a time value expressed in hours and determines when downloading starts. It is the number of hours before the scheduled installation or update time. In this example, content is downloaded 24 hours before the installation time. The start time for download depends on the selected contact method for a system. Next time an action is scheduled, packages are automatically downloaded, but not installed. At the scheduled time, the staged packages are installed. There are two parameters used to configure content staging: salt_content_staging_advance is the advance time for the content staging window to open, in hours. This is the number of hours before installation starts, that package downloads can begin. salt_content_staging_window is the duration of the content staging window, in hours. This is the amount of time clients have to stage packages before installation begins. For example, if salt_content_staging_advance is set to six hours, and salt_content_staging_window is set to two hours, the staging window opens six hours before the installation time, and remain open for two hours. No packages are downloaded in the four remaining hours until installation starts. If you set the same value for both salt_content_staging_advance and salt_content_staging_window packages are able to be downloaded until installation begins. Configure the content staging parameters in /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java.conf. Default values: salt_content_staging_advance: 8 hours salt_content_staging_window: 8 hours Content staging must be enabled for these parameters to work correctly.","title":"Content Staging","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-staging","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-staging.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure Content Staging","hash":"_configure_content_staging","id":2}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"Custom channels give you the ability to create your own software packages and repositories, which you can use to update your clients. They also allow you to use software provided by third party vendors in your environment. This section gives more detail on how to create, administer, and delete custom channels. You must have administrator privileges to be able to create and manage custom channels. Before you create a custom channel, determine which base channel you want to associate it with, and which repositories you want to use for content. If you have custom software packages that you need to install on your client systems, you can create a custom child channel to manage them. You need to create the channel in the Uyuni Web UI and create a repository for the packages, before assigning the channel to your systems. Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system. You can select a vendor channel as the base channel if you want to use packages provided by a vendor. Alternatively, select none to make your custom channel a base channel. Procedure: Creating a Custom Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and click Create Channel. On the Create Software Channel page, give your channel a name (for example, My Tools SLES 15 SP1 x86_64) and a label (for example, my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64). Labels must not contain spaces or uppercase letters. In the Parent Channel drop down, choose the relevant base channel (for example, SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64). Ensure that you choose the compatible parent channel for your packages. In the Architecture drop down, choose the appropriate hardware architecture (for example, x86_64). Provide any additional information in the contact details, channel access control, and GPG fields, as required for your environment. Click Create Channel. Custom channels sometimes require additional security settings. Many third party vendors secure packages with GPG. If you want to use GPG-protected packages in your custom channel, you need to trust the GPG key which has been used to sign the metadata. You can then check the Has Signed Metadata? check box to match the package metadata against the trusted GPG keys. If remote channels and repositories are signed with GPG keys, you can import and trust these GPG keys. For example, execute the spacewalk-repo-sync from the command line on the Uyuni Server: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync -c <channellabelname> -t yum The underlying zypper call will import the key, if it is available. The Web UI does not offer this feature. This only works when the repository you want to mirror is set up in a special way and provides the \"key\" in the repository next to the signature. This is the case for all repositories generated by the Open Build Service (OBS). For other repositories special preparation steps are needed, as described further below. By default, the Enable GPG Check field is checked when you create a new channel. If you would like to add custom packages and applications to your channel, make sure you uncheck this field to be able to install unsigned packages. Disabling the GPG check is a security risk if packages are from an untrusted source. You can only add a repository to the Uyuni with the Web UI if it is a valid software repository. Check in advance that needed repository metadata are available. Tools such as createrepo and reprepro are useful in this regard. mgrpush can help with pushing a single RPM into a channel without creating a repository. For more information, see the man pages for createrepo_c and reprepro. Procedure: Adding a Software Repository In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Repositories, and click Create Repository. On the Create Repository page, give your repository a label (for example, my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo). In the Repository URL field, provide the path to the directory that contains the repodata file (for example, file:///opt/mytools/). You can use any valid addressing protocol in this field. Uncheck the Has Signed Metadata? check box. OPTIONAL: Complete the SSL fields if your repository requires client certificate authentication. Click Create Repository. The above procedure only works if the repository you want to mirror provides the \"key\" in the repository next to the signature. This is the case for all repositories generated by the OBS, but it is typically not the case for repositories of operating systems that are not offered by the OBS. If the repository you want to use does not have a GPG key you can provide one yourself and import the GPG key into the keyring manually. If you import the key into the /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir keyring using the gpg command line tool it would be stored permanently. The key would also persist if the chroot environment would be cleaned. Procedure: Creating a Software Repository with GPG Key The command to import a key into the keyring is: mgradm gpg add /path/to/gpg.key Add Debian non-flat repositories using uyuni_suite, uyuni_component, and uyuni_arch query parameters. uyuni_suite is mandatory. In Debian documentation, this is also known as distribution. With this parameter you specify the apt source. Without this parameter the original approach is used. If the parameter ends with /, the repository is identified as flat. uyuni_component is optional. This parameter can specify only one component. It is not possible to list the components. An apt source entry allows to specify multiple components, but for Uyuni it is not possible. Instead you must create a separate repository for each component. uyuni_arch is optional. If omitted the architecture name is calculated with a SQL query for the channel from the database. Specify uyuni_arch explicitly if it does not match the architecture of the channel (sometimes architecture naming is ambiguous). Here are some examples: Table 1. Debian Non-flat Repository mapping Type Source line / URL apt source line deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ URL mapping https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable?uyuni_suite=binary/ apt source line deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main URL mapping https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists?uyuni_suite=stable&uyuni_component=main This following information about the Debian repository definition format is based on https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Overview. The repository definition format is as follows: deb uri suite [component1] [component2] [...] For example: deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main or deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ For each pair of suite and component the spezification defines a distinct URL calculated on the base URL + suite + component. Procedure: Assigning the Repository to a Channel Assign your new repository to your custom channel by navigating to Software Manage Channels, clicking the name of your newly created custom channel. Navigate to the Repositories tab, and ensure the repository you want to assign to the channel is checked. Click Save Repositories. By default, the synchronization process starts immediately. For more information about channel synchronization, see Custom Channel Synchronization. Procedure: Adding Custom Channels to an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and select the key you want to add the custom channel to. On the Details tab, in the Child Channels listing, select the channel to associate. You can select multiple channels, if you need to. Click Update Activation Key. To avoid missing important updates, SUSE recommends to keep your custom channels up to date with the remote repositories changes. By default, a synchronization will happen automatically for all custom channels you create. In particular, it will happen: after adding a repository to a channel from the UI or by using spacewalk-common-channels as part of the daily task mgr-sync-refresh-default, which will synchronize all your custom and vendor channels. To disable this default behaviour, set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: java.unify_custom_channel_management = 0 With this property turned off, no synchronization is performed automatically and, in order to keep a custom channel up to date, you need to: synchronize it manually by navigating to the Sync tab and click Sync Now, set up an automated synchronization schedule from the Repositories tab. When the process is started, there are several ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing: In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and select the Products tab. This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the menu:[Repositories > Sync] tab. The Sync Status is shown next to the repository name. Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. The following custom channel synchronization options are available: Retain packages in channels which have been removed from the repository This turns off strict mode. Do not sync errata Do not synchronize patches. Sync only latest packages Synchronize latest package version only. Create kickstartable tree This option prepares a directory tree ready for Kickstart auto installation. Terminate upon any error Stop synchronizing if an error occurs. These options will be saved persistently for each channel. The Sync now button also saves the channel options before performing the synchronization. When you create a new custom channel without cloning it from an existing channel, it does not contain any packages or patches. You can add the packages and patches you require using the Uyuni Web UI. Custom channels can only include packages or patches that are cloned or custom, and they must match the base architecture of the channel. Patches added to custom channels must apply to a package that exists in the channel. Procedure: Adding Packages to Custom Channels In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and go to the Packages tab. OPTIONAL: See all packages currently in the channel by navigating to the List/Remove tab. Add new packages to the channel by navigating to the Add tab. Select the parent channel to provide packages, and click View Packages to populate the list. Check the packages to add to the custom channel, and click Add Packages. When you are satisfied with the selection, click Confirm Addition to add the packages to the channel. OPTIONAL: You can compare the packages in the current channel with those in a different channel by navigating to Software Manage Channels, and going to the Packages Compare tab. To make the two channels the same, click the Merge Differences button, and resolve any conflicts. Procedure: Adding Patches to a Custom Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and go to the Patches tab. OPTIONAL: See all patches currently in the channel by navigating to the List/Remove tab. Add new patches to the channel by navigating to the Add tab, and selecting what kind of patches you want to add. Select the parent channel to provide patches, and click View Associated Patches to populate the list. Check the patches to add to the custom channel, and click Confirm. When you are satisfied with the selection, click Confirm to add the patches to the channel. Uyuni administrators and channel administrators can alter or delete any channel. To grant other users rights to alter or delete a channel, navigate to Software Manage Channels and select the channel you want to edit. Navigate to the Managers tab, and check the user to grant permissions. Click Update to save the changes. If you delete a channel that has been assigned to a set of clients, it triggers an immediate update of the channel state for any clients associated with the deleted channel. This is to ensure that the changes are reflected accurately in the repository file. You cannot delete Uyuni channels with the Web UI. Only custom channels can be deleted. Procedure: Deleting Custom Channels In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and select the channel you want to delete. Click Delete software channel. On the Delete Channel page, check the details of the channel you are deleting, and check the Unsubscribe Systems checkbox to remove the custom channel from any systems that might still be subscribed. Click Delete Channel. When channels are deleted, the packages that are part of the deleted channel are not automatically removed. You are not able to update packages that have had their channel deleted. You can delete packages that are not associated with a channel in the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Software Manage Packages, check the packages to remove, and click Delete Packages.","title":"Custom Channels","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"custom-channels","url":"/uyuni/administration/custom-channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The repository mirroring tool (RMT) is available on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 and later. RMT replaces the subscription management tool (SMT), which can be used on older SUSE Linux Enterprise installations. In a disconnected Uyuni setup, RMT or SMT uses an external network to connect to SUSE Customer Center. All software channels and repositories are synchronized to a removable storage device. The storage device can then be used to update the disconnected Uyuni installation. This setup allows your Uyuni installation to remain in an offline, disconnected environment. Your RMT or SMT instance must be used to manage the Uyuni Server directly. It cannot be used to manage a second RMT or SMT instance, in a cascade. For more information on RMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/book-rmt.html. You can use RMT on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 installations to manage clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 or later. We recommend you set up a dedicated RMT instance for each Uyuni installation. Procedure: Setting up RMT On the RMT instance, install the RMT package: zypper in rmt-server Configure RMT using YaST: yast2 rmt Follow the prompts to complete installation. For more information on setting up RMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/book-rmt.html. Procedure: Synchronizing RMT with SCC On the RMT instance, list all available products and repositories for your organization: rmt-cli products list --all rmt-cli repos list --all Synchronize all available updates for your organization: rmt-cli sync You can also configure RMT to synchronize regularly using systemd. Enable the products you require. For example, to enable SLES 15: rmt-cli product enable sles/15/x86_64 Export the synchronized data to your removable storage. In this example, the storage medium is mounted at /mnt/usb: rmt-cli export data /mnt/usb Export the enabled repositories to your removable storage: rmt-cli export settings /mnt/usb rmt-cli export repos /mnt/usb Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user. You can change RMT user settings in the cli section of /etc/rmt.conf. SMT is included with SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, and can be used to manage clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 or later. SMT requires you to create a local mirror directory on the SMT instance to synchronize repositories and packages. For more details on installing and configuring SMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/book-smt.html. Procedure: Synchronizing SMT with SCC On the SMT instance, create a database replacement file: smt-sync --createdbreplacementfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml Export the synchronized data to your removable storage. In this example, the storage medium is mounted at /mnt/usb: smt-sync --todir /mnt/usb smt-mirror --dbreplfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml --directory /mnt/usb \\ --fromlocalsmt -L /var/log/smt/smt-mirror-export.log curl https://scc.suse.com/multi-linux-manager/product_tree.json -o /mnt/usb/product_tree.json Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user. You can change SMT user settings in /etc/smt.conf. The corresponding Uyuni Client Tools Channels are required, for Uyuni to be able to synchronize a given channel. If these channels are not enabled, Uyuni may fail to detect that product. Run the following command to enable these mandatory channels: SLES 12 and products based on it such as SLES for SAP or SLE HPC RMT: rmt-cli products enable sle-manager-tools/12/x86_64 SMT: smt repos -p sle-manager-tools,12,x86_64 SLES 15 and products based on it such as SLES for SAP or SLE HPC RMT: rmt-cli products enable sle-manager-tools/15/x86_64 SMT: smt repos -p sle-manager-tools,15,x86_64 Then mirror the channels, and export. Other distributions, or architectures, can be enabled. For more information about enabling product channels or repositories to be mirrored, see the documentation: RMT https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-rmt-mirroring.html#sec-rmt-mirroring-enable-disable SMT https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/single-html/SLES-smt/index.html#smt-mirroring-manage-domirror To set up Uyuni as a disconnected server follow the instructions of an air-gapped deployment. It is recommended to deploy a disconnected server as a Virtual Machine (VM) using a provided image. For an air-gapped deployment of Uyuni Server, see Uyuni Server Air-gapped Deployment. Keep in mind to execute the final command with the --mirror option and replace </media/disk> with your mount point: mgradm install podman --mirror </media/disk> When you have removable media loaded with your SUSE Customer Center data, you can use it to synchronize your disconnected server. The removable media that you use for synchronization must always be available at the same mount point. Do not trigger a synchronization if the storage medium is not mounted. This results in data corruption. Procedure: Synchronizing a Disconnected Server Restart the Tomcat service: mgrctl exec -ti -- systemctl restart tomcat Refresh the local data: mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-sync refresh Perform a synchronization: mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-sync list channels mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-sync add channel channel-label Be aware that if server.susemanager.fromdir is set, Uyuni will not be able to check if SUSE Customer Center credentials are valid or not. Instead, a warning sign will be displayed and no SCC online check will be performed. An alternative to disconnected setup may be to copy content between servers using Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS).

Procedure: Building and Pushing Images Define an image store. Define an image profile and associate it with a source (either a git repository or a directory). Build the image. Push the image to the image store. Uyuni supports these two build types: Dockerfile and the Kiwi build type. The Kiwi build type is used to build system, virtual, and other images. The image store for the Kiwi build type is pre-defined as a file system directory at /srv/www/os-images on the server. Uyuni serves the image store over HTTPS from https://<SERVER-FQDN>/os-images/. The image store location is unique and is not customizable. Images are stored in /srv/www/os-image/ORGANIZATION-ID. The containers feature is available for Salt clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 or later. Before you begin, ensure your environment meets these requirements: A published git repository containing a Dockerfile and configuration scripts. The repository can be public or private, and should be hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. A properly configured image store, such as a Docker registry. For more information on containers, see https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/html/Container-guide/. To build images with Uyuni, you need to create and configure a build host. Container build hosts are Salt clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 or later. This section guides you through the initial configuration for a build host. The operating system on the build host must match the operating system on the targeted image. For example, build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SP2 or later) OS version. Build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 OS version. Cross-architecture builds are not supported. From the Uyuni Web UI, perform these steps to configure a build host: Procedure: Building a Host Select a Salt client to be designated as a build host from the Systems Systems overview page. From the System Details page of the selected client assign the containers modules. Navigate to Software Software Channels and enable the containers module (for example, SLE-Module-Containers15-Pool and SLE-Module-Containers15-Updates). Continue with Next. Schedule the Software Channel Change, and click Confirm. From the System Details tab select Properties page, and enable Container Build Host from the Add-on System Types list. Confirm by clicking Update Properties. Install all required packages by applying Highstate. From the system details tab select States Highstate, and click Apply Highstate. Alternatively, apply Highstate from the Uyuni Server command line: salt '$your_client' state.highstate The containers built with Uyuni use channels associated to the activation key as repositories when building the image. This section guides you through creating an ad-hoc activation key for this purpose. To build a container, you need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than SUSE Manager Default. Procedure: Creating an Activation Key Select Systems Activation Keys. Click Create Key. Enter a Description and a Key name. Use the drop-down menu to select the Base Channel to associate with this key. Confirm with Create Activation Key. For more information, see Activation Keys. All built images are pushed to an image store. This section contains information about creating an image store. Procedure: Creating Image Store Select Images Stores. Click Create to create a new store. From the Store Type select the correct type. Define a name for the image store in the Label field. Provide the path to your image registry by filling in the URI field, as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the container registry host (whether internal or external). registry.example.com The Registry URI can also be used to specify an image store on a registry that is already in use. registry.example.com:5000/myregistry/myproject Click Create to add the new image store. All container images are built using an image profile, which contains the building instructions. This section contains information about creating an image profile with the Uyuni Web UI. Procedure: Creating an Image Profile To create an image profile select Images Profiles and click Create. Provide a name for the image profile by filling in the Label field. If your container image tag is in a format such as myproject/myimage, make sure your image store registry URI contains the /myproject suffix. Use Dockerfile as the Image Type. Use the drop-down menu to select your registry from the Target Image Store field. In the Path field, type a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository URL. The path can also be a local directory on the build host. The URL should be http, https, or a token authentication URL. For GitHub or GitLab, use one of these formats: GitHub Path Options GitHub single user project repository https://github.com/USER/project.git#branchname:folder GitHub organization project repository https://github.com/ORG/project.git#branchname:folder GitHub token authentication If your git repository is private, modify the profile’s URL to include authentication. Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitHub token: https://USER:<AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>@github.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab single user project repository https://gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab groups project repository https://gitlab.example.com/GROUP/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab token authentication If your git repository is private and not publicly accessible, you need to modify the profile’s git URL to include authentication. Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitLab token: https://gitlab-ci-token:<AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>@gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ If you do not specify a git branch, the master branch is used by default. If a folder is not specified, the image sources (Dockerfile sources) are expected to be in the root directory of the GitHub or GitLab checkout. Select an Activation Key. Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages. When you associate an activation key with an image profile you are ensuring any image using the profile uses the correct software channel and any packages in the channel. Click the Create button. An Image Profile that can be reused is published at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The ARG parameters ensure that the built image is associated with the desired repository served by Uyuni. The ARG parameters also allow you to build image versions of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server which may differ from the version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server used by the build host itself. For example: The ARG repo parameter and the echo command pointing to the repository file, creates and then injects the correct path into the repository file for the desired channel version. The repository is determined by the activation key that you assigned to your image profile. FROM registry.example.com/sles12sp2 MAINTAINER Tux Administrator \"tux@example.com\" ### Begin: These lines are required for use with {productname} ARG repo ARG cert # Add the correct certificate RUN echo \"$cert\" > /etc/pki/trust/anchors/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT.pem # Update certificate trust store RUN update-ca-certificates # Add the repository path to the image RUN echo \"$repo\" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager:dockerbuild.repo ### End: These lines are required for use with {productname} # Add the package script ADD add_packages.sh /root/add_packages.sh # Run the package script RUN /root/add_packages.sh # After building remove the repository path from image RUN rm -f /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager:dockerbuild.repo You can assign custom info key-value pairs to attach information to the image profiles. Additionally, these key-value pairs are passed to the Docker build command as buildargs. For more information about the available custom info keys and creating additional ones, see Custom System Information. There are two ways to build an image. The first way is to create it from scratch. To do that, select Images Build from the left navigation bar, or click the build icon in the Images Profiles list and follow the procedure. Procedure: Building an image Select Images Build. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default latest (only relevant to containers). Select Build Profile and Build Host. Notice the Profile Summary to the right of the build fields. When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile is displayed in this area. To schedule a build click the Build button. The second way to build an image is to import and inspect arbitrary images. To do that, select Images Image List from the left navigation bar. Complete the text boxes of the Import dialog. When it has processed, the imported image is listed on the Image List page. Procedure: Importing an Image From Images Image list click Import to open the Import Image dialog. In the Import Image dialog complete these fields: Image store The registry from where the image is pulled for inspection. Image name The name of the image in the registry. Image version The version of the image in the registry. Build host The build host that pulls and inspects the image. Activation key The activation key that provides the path to the software channel that the image is inspected with. For confirmation, click Import. The entry for the image is created in the database, and an Inspect Image action on Uyuni is scheduled. When it has been processed, you can find the imported image in the Image List. It has a different icon in the Build column, to indicate that the image is imported. The status icon for the imported image can also be seen on the Overview tab for the image. A base container image (BCI) comes with all the software to run it, but because BCIs are lightweight they may not come with all tools and libraries you may need for inspection. When inspecting a container image you can see an error message such as: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory A BCI can be used in the other scenarios than with the container build host and using the Salt bundle for the inspection, but if you need inspection to work you must add all needed software in advance. To avoid such issues you must add libopenssl to the image with Dockerfile and rebuild the image. The same can happen with libexpat. These are some known problems when working with images: HTTPS certificates to access the registry or the git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file. SSH git access using Docker is currently unsupported. OS Images are built by the Kiwi build system. The output image is customizable and can be PXE, QCOW2, LiveCD, or other types of images. For more information about the Kiwi build system, see the Kiwi documentation. The Kiwi image building feature is available for Salt clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11. Kiwi image configuration files and configuration scripts must be accessible in one of these locations: Git repository HTTP or HTTPS hosted tar archive Local directory on the build host For an example of a complete Kiwi repository served by git, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. You need at least 1 GB of RAM available for hosts running OS Images built with Kiwi. Disk space depends on the actual size of the image. For more information, see the documentation of the underlying system. To build all kinds of images with Uyuni, create and configure a build host. OS Image build hosts are Salt clients running on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SP2 or later) or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (SP4 or later). This procedure guides you through the initial configuration for a build host. The operating system on the build host must match the operating system on the targeted image. For example, build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SP2 or later) OS version. Build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 OS version. Cross-architecture builds are not possible. For example, you must build Raspberry PI SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 image on a Raspberry PI (aarch64 architecture) build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3. Procedure: Configure the Build Host in the Uyuni Web UI Select a client to be designated as a build host from the Systems Overview page. Navigate to the System Details Properties tab, and check the Add-on System Type > OS Image Build Host box. Confirm with Update Properties. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and enable the required software channels depending on the build host version. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 build hosts require Uyuni Client tools (SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool and SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates). SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 build hosts require SUSE Linux Enterprise Server modules SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP4-Pool and SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP4-Updates. Schedule and click Confirm. Install Kiwi and all required packages by applying Highstate. From the system details page select States Highstate and click Apply Highstate. Alternatively, apply Highstate from the Uyuni Server command line: salt '$your_client' state.highstate Build host provisioning copies the Uyuni certificate RPM to the build host. This certificate is used for accessing repositories provided by Uyuni. The certificate is packaged in RPM by the mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage package script. The package script is called automatically during a new Uyuni installation. When you upgrade the spacewalk-certs-tools package, the upgrade scenario calls the package script using the default values. However if the certificate path was changed or unavailable, call the package script manually using --ca-cert-full-path <path_to_certificate> after the upgrade procedure has finished. /usr/sbin/mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage --ca-cert-full-path /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT The RPM package with the certificate is stored in a salt-accessible directory such as: /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm The RPM package with the certificate is provided in the local build host repository: /var/lib/Kiwi/repo Specify the RPM package with the Uyuni SSL certificate in the build source, and make sure your Kiwi configuration contains rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage as a required package in the bootstrap section. Listing 1. config.xml ... <packages type=\"bootstrap\"> ... <package name=\"rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage\" bootinclude=\"true\"/> </packages> ... Create an activation key associated with the channel that your OS Images can use as repositories when building the image. Activation keys are mandatory for OS Image building. To build OS Images, you need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than SUSE Manager Default. Procedure: Creating an Activation Key In the Web UI, select Systems Activation Keys. Click Create Key. Enter a Description, a Key name, and use the drop-down box to select a Base Channel to associate with the key. Confirm with Create Activation Key. For more information, see Activation Keys. OS Images can require a significant amount of storage space. Therefore, we recommended that the OS Image store is located on a partition of its own or on a Btrfs subvolume, separate from the root partition. By default, the image store is located at /srv/www/os-images. Image stores for Kiwi build type, used to build system, virtual, and other images, are not supported yet. Images are always stored in /srv/www/os-images/ORGANIZATION-ID and are accessible via HTTP/HTTPS https://<uyuni_host>/os-images/ORGANIZATION-ID. Manage image profiles using the Web UI. Procedure: Creating an Image Profile To create an image profile select from Images Profiles and click Create. In the Label field, provide a name for the Image Profile. Use Kiwi as the Image Type. Image store is automatically selected. Enter a Config URL to the directory containing the Kiwi configuration files. For example, a git URI such as https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master:OSImage/SLE-Micro54. Other options are a HTTP or HTTPS hosted tar archive or a local directory on the build host. For more information, see source format options at the end of this section. Enter Kiwi options if needed. If the Kiwi configuration files specify multiple profiles, use --profile <name> to select the active one. For other options, see Kiwi documentation. Select an Activation Key. Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages. Associate an activation key with an image profile to ensure the image profile uses the correct software channel, and any packages. Confirm with the Create button. Source Format Options git/HTTP(S) URL to the repository URL to a public or private git repository containing the sources of the image to be built. Depending on the layout of the repository the URL can be: https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles You can specify a branch after the # character in the URL. In this example, we use the master branch: https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master You can specify a directory that contains the image sources after the : character. In this example, we use OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6: https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master:OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6 HTTP(S) URL to the tar archive URL to the tar archive, compressed or uncompressed, hosted on the webserver. https://myimagesourceserver.example.org/MyKiwiImage.tar.gz Path to the directory on the build host Enter the path to the directory with the Kiwi build system sources. This directory must be present on the selected build host. /var/lib/Kiwi/MyKiwiImage Kiwi sources consist at least of config.xml. Usually, config.sh and images.sh are present as well. Sources can also contain files to be installed in the final image under the root subdirectory. For information about the Kiwi build system, see the Kiwi documentation. SUSE provides examples of fully functional image sources at the SUSE/manager-build-profiles public GitHub repository. Listing 2.

Either select Images Build, or click the build icon in the Images Profiles list. Procedure: Building an Image Select Images Build. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default latest (applies only to containers). Select the Image Profile and a Build Host. A Profile Summary is displayed to the right of the build fields. When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile is shown here. To schedule a build, click the Build button. The build server cannot run any form of automounter during the image building process. If applicable, ensure that you do not have your Gnome session running as root. If an automounter is running, the image build finishes successfully, but the checksum of the image is different and causes a failure. After the image is successfully built, the inspection phase begins. During the inspection phase SUSE Multi-Linux Manager collects information about the image: List of packages installed in the image Checksum of the image Image type and other image details If the built image type is PXE, a Salt pillar is also generated. Image pillars are stored in the database and the Salt subsystem can access details about the generated image. Details include where the image files are located and provided, image checksums, information needed for network boot, and more. The generated pillar is available to all connected clients. Building an image requires several dependent steps. When the build fails, investigating Salt states results and build log can help identify the source of the failure. You can carry out these checks when the build fails: The build host can access the build sources There is enough disk space for the image on both the build host and the Uyuni server The activation key has the correct channels associated with it The build sources used are valid The RPM package with the Uyuni public certificate is up to date and available at /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm. For more on how to refresh a public certificate RPM, see Create a Build Host. The section contains some known issues when working with images. HTTPS certificates used to access the HTTP sources or git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file, or configured manually. Importing Kiwi-based images is not supported. To list available built images select Images Image List. A list of all images is displayed. Displayed data about images includes an image Name, its Version, Revision, and the build Status. You can also see the image update status with a listing of possible patch and package updates that are available for the image. For OS Images, the Name and Version fields originate from Kiwi sources and are updated at the end of successful build. During building or after failed build these fields show a temporary name based on profile name. Revision is automatically increased after each successful build. For OS Images, multiple revisions can co-exist in the store. For Container Images the store holds only the latest revision. Information about previous revisions (packages, patches, etc.) are preserved and it is possible to list them with the Show obsolete checkbox. Clicking the Details button on an image provides a detailed view. The detailed view includes an exact list of relevant patches, list of all packages installed within the image and a build log. Clicking the Delete button deletes the image from the list. It also deletes the associated pillar, files from OS Image Store and obsolete revisions. The patch and the package list is only available if the inspect state after a build was successful.","title":"Image Building and Management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"image-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/image-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Uyuni Server related systems such as Inter-Server Synchronization Slave Servers or Uyuni Proxies are also affected and have to be considered. SUSE recommends you always keep your Uyuni infrastructure updated. That includes servers, proxies, and build hosts. If you do not keep the Uyuni Server updated, you might not be able to update some parts of your environment when you need to. This section contains a checklist for your downtime period, with links to further information on performing each of the steps. Procedure: Server checks Apply the latest updates. Upgrade to the latest service pack, if required. Run spacewalk-service status and check whether all required services are up and running. You can install updates using a package manager: For information on using YaST, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-onlineupdate-you.html. For information on using zypper, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-sw-cl.html#sec-zypper. By default, several update channels are configured and enabled for the Uyuni Server. New and updated packages become available automatically. When the server is updated consider updating some tools on the clients, too. Updating salt-minion, zypper, and other related management package on clients is not a strict requirement, but it is a best practice in general. For example, a maintenance update on the server might introduce a major new Salt version. Then Salt clients continue to work but might experience problems later on. To avoid this always update the salt-minion package when available. SUSE makes sure that salt-minion can always be updated safely. If you are using an Inter-Server Synchronization slave server, update it after the Uyuni Server update is complete. For more information, see Inter-Server Synchronization - Version 2. If you are using a monitoring server for Prometheus, update it after the Uyuni Server update is complete. For more information on monitoring, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Proxies should be updated as soon as Uyuni Server updates are complete. In general, running a proxy connected to a server on a different version is not supported. The only exception is for the duration of updates where it is expected that the server is updated first, so the proxy could run the previous version temporarily. Always upgrade the server first, then any proxy.","title":"Infrastructure maintenance tasks","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"infra-maintenance","url":"/uyuni/administration/infra-maintenance.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Therefore, it is important that clients using Live Patching do not have newer kernels available in the channels they are assigned to. Clients using live patching have updates for the running kernel in the live patching channels. There are two ways to manage channels for live patching: Use content lifecycle management to clone the product tree and remove kernel versions newer than the running one. This procedure is explained in the administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#enhance-project-with-livepatching. This is the recommended solution. Alternatively, use the spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle tool. This procedure is more manual and requires command line tools as well as the Web UI. This procedure is explained in this section for SLES 15 SP5, but it also works for SLE 12 SP4 or later. spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle has been deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release. Users are advised to switch to the supported and feature-rich Content Lifecycle Management (CLM) API instead. Cloned vendor channels should be prefixed by dev for development, testing, or prod for production. In this procedure, you create a dev cloned channel and then promote the channel to testing. Procedure: Cloning Live Patching Channels At the command prompt on the client, as root, obtain the current package channel tree: # spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --list-channels Spacewalk Username: admin Spacewalk Password: Channel tree: 1. sles15-sp7-pool-x86_64 \\__ sle-live-patching15-pool-x86_64-sp7 \\__ sle-live-patching15-updates-x86_64-sp7 \\__ sle-manager-tools15-pool-x86_64-sp7 \\__ sle-manager-tools15-updates-x86_64-sp7 \\__ sles15-sp7-updates-x86_64 Use the spacewalk-manage-channel command with the init argument to automatically create a new development clone of the original vendor channel: spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --init -c sles15-sp7-pool-x86_64 Check that dev-sles15-sp7-updates-x86_64 is available in your channel list. Check the dev cloned channel you created, and remove any kernel updates that require a reboot. Procedure: Removing Non-Live Kernel Patches from Cloned Channels Check the current kernel version by selecting the client from Systems System List, and taking note of the version displayed in the Kernel field. In the Uyuni Web UI, select the client from Systems Overview, navigate to the Software Manage Channels tab, and select dev-sles15-sp7-updates-x86_64. Navigate to the Patches tab, and click List/Remove Patches. In the search bar, type kernel and identify the kernel version that matches the kernel currently used by your client. Remove all kernel versions that are newer than the currently installed kernel. Your channel is now set up for live patching, and can be promoted to testing. In this procedure, you also add the live patching child channels to your client, ready to be applied. Procedure: Promoting Live Patching Channels At the command prompt on the client, as root, promote and clone the dev-sles15-sp7-pool-x86_64 channel to a new testing channel: # spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --promote -c dev-sles15-sp7-pool-x86_64 In the Uyuni Web UI, select the client from Systems Overview, and navigate to the Software Software Channels tab. Check the new test-sles15-sp7-pool-x86_64 custom channel to change the base channel, and check both corresponding live patching child channels.

When you have created your maintenance window schedule, and applied it to a client, you are prevented from executing some actions outside of the specified period. Maintenance windows operate in a different way to system locking. System locks are switched on or off as required, while maintenance windows define periods of time when actions are allowed. Additionally, the allowed and restricted actions differ. For more information about system locks, see System Locking. Maintenance windows require both a calendar, and a schedule. The calendar defines the date and time of your maintenance window events, including recurring events, and must be in ical format. The schedule uses the events defined in the calendar to create the maintenance windows. You must create an ical file for upload, or link to an ical file to create the calendar, before you can create the schedule. When you have created the schedule, you can assign it to clients that are registered to the Uyuni Server. Clients that have a maintenance schedule assigned cannot run restricted actions outside of maintenance windows. Restricted actions significantly modify the client, and could potentially cause the client to stop running. Some examples of restricted actions are: Package installation Client upgrade Product migration Highstate application (for Salt clients) Unrestricted actions are minor actions that are considered safe and are unlikely to cause problems on the client. Some examples of unrestricted actions are: Package profile update Hardware refresh Subscribing to software channels Before you begin, you must create an ical file for upload, or link to an ical file to create the calendar. You can create ical files in your preferred calendaring tool, such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, or KOrganizer. Procedure: Uploading a New Maintenance Calendar In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Schedule Maintenance Windows Calendars, and click Create. In the Calendar Name section, type a name for your calendar. Either provide a URL to your ical file, or upload the file directly. Click Create Calendar to save your calendar. Procedure: Creating a New Schedule In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Schedule Maintenance Windows Schedules, and click Create. In the Schedule Name section, type a name for your schedule. OPTIONAL: If your ical file contains events that apply to more than one schedule, check Multi. Select the calendar to assign to this schedule. Click Create Schedule to save your schedule. Procedure: Assigning a Schedule to a Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List, select the client to be assigned to a schedule, locate the System Properties panel, and click Edit These Properties. Alternatively, you can assign clients through the system set manager by navigating to Systems System Set Manager and using the Misc Maintenance Windows tab. In the Edit System Details page, locate the Maintenance Schedule field, and select the name of the schedule to be assigned. Click Update Properties to assign the maintenance schedule. When you assign a new maintenance schedule to a client, it is possible that the client might already have some restricted actions scheduled, and that these might now conflict with the new maintenance schedule. If this occurs, the Web UI displays an error and you cannot assign the schedule to the client. To resolve this, check the Cancel affected actions option when you assign the schedule. This cancels any previously scheduled actions that conflict with the new maintenance schedule. When you have created your maintenance windows, you can schedule restricted actions, such as package upgrades, to be performed during the maintenance window. Procedure: Scheduling a Package Upgrade In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List, select the client you want to upgrade, and go to the Software Packages Upgrade tab. Select the package to upgrade from the list, and click Upgrade Packages. In the Maintenance Window field, select which maintenance window the client should use to perform the upgrade. Click Confirm to schedule the package upgrade. When you create a calendar, it contains a number of events, which can be either one-time events, or recurring events. Each event contains a summary field. If you want to create multiple maintenance schedules for one calendar, you can specify events for each using the summary field. For example, you might like to create a schedule for production servers, and a different schedule for testing servers. In this case, you would specify SUMMARY: Production Servers on events for the production servers, and SUMMARY: Testing Servers on events for the testing servers. There are two types of schedule: single, or multi. If your calendar contains events that apply to more than one schedule, then you must select multi, and ensure you name the schedule according to the summary field you used in the calendar file. Procedure: Creating a Multi Schedule In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Schedule Maintenance Windows Schedules, and click Create. In the Schedule Name section, type the name for your schedule. Ensure it matches the summary field of the calendar. Check the Multi option. Select the calendar to assign to this schedule. Click Create Schedule to save your schedule. To create the next schedule, click Create. In the Schedule Name section, type the name for your second schedule. Ensure it matches the summary field of the second calendar. Check the Multi option. Click Create Schedule to save your schedule. Repeat for each schedule you need to create. This sections contains a complete list of restricted and unrestricted actions. Restricted actions significantly modify the client, and could potentially cause the client to stop running. Restricted actions can only be run during a maintenance window. The restricted actions are: Package operations (for example, installing, updating, or removing packages) Patch updates Rebooting a client Rolling back transactions Configuration management changing tasks Applying a highstate (for Salt clients) Autoinstallation and reinstallation Remote commands Product migrations Cluster operations For Salt clients, it is possible to run remote commands directly at any time by navigating to Salt Remote Commands.

Uyuni Server and Proxy are able to provide self-health metrics. You can also install and manage a number of Prometheus exporters on Salt clients. Prometheus and Grafana packages are included in the Uyuni Client Tools for: SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 openSUSE Leap 15.x Only the above listed clients are supported as a monitoring server. You need to install Prometheus and Grafana on a machine separate from the Uyuni Server. We recommend to use a managed Salt SUSE client as your monitoring server. Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to monitored clients. Clients must have corresponding open ports and be reachable over the network. Alternatively, you can use reverse proxies to establish a connection. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool that is used to record real-time metrics in a time-series database. Metrics are pulled via HTTP, enabling high performance and scalability. Prometheus metrics are time series data, or timestamped values belonging to the same group or dimension. A metric is uniquely identified by its name and set of labels. metric name labels timestamp value ┌────────┴───────┐ ┌───────────┴───────────┐ ┌──────┴──────┐ ┌─┴─┐ http_requests_total{status=\"200\", method=\"GET\"} @1557331801.111 42236 Each application or system being monitored must expose metrics in the format above, either through code instrumentation or Prometheus exporters. Exporters are libraries that help with exporting metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics. Exporters are useful whenever it is not feasible to instrument a given application or system with Prometheus metrics directly. Multiple exporters can run on a monitored host to export local metrics. The Prometheus community provides a list of official exporters, and more can be found as community contributions. For more information and an extensive list of exporters, see https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/. Grafana is a tool for data visualization, monitoring, and analysis. It is used to create dashboards with panels representing specific metrics over a set period of time. Grafana is commonly used together with Prometheus, but also supports other data sources such as ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Influx DB. For more information about Grafana, see https://grafana.com/docs/. To set up your monitoring server, you need to install Prometheus and Grafana, and configure them. Only SUSE clients are supported as a monitoring server. For a complete list, see Requirements. If your monitoring server is a Salt client, you can install the Prometheus package using the Uyuni Web UI. Otherwise you can download and install the package on your monitoring server manually. The Prometheus software is also available for Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni for Retail Branch Server. To access a shell inside the Server container run mgrctl term on the container host. To copy files from inside the container use mgrctl cp. Prometheus expects POSIX filesystem for storing data. Non-POSIX compliant filesystems are not supported. NFS filesystems are not supported.

For more information on how to manually install and configure Grafana, see https://grafana.com/docs. With Uyuni 4 and higher, you can enable the server to expose Prometheus self-health metrics, and also install and configure exporters on client systems. The Server self-health metrics cover hardware, operating system and Uyuni internals. These metrics are made available by instrumentation of the Java application, combined with Prometheus exporters. These exporters are shipped with Uyuni Server: Node exporter: golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter. PostgreSQL exporter: prometheus-postgres_exporter. See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter. JMX exporter: prometheus-jmx_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter. These exporter packages are shipped with Uyuni Proxy: Node exporter: golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter. Squid exporter: golang-github-boynux-squid_exporter. See https://github.com/boynux/squid-exporter. The exporters are pre-installed in Uyuni Server and Proxy, but their respective systemd daemons are disabled by default. Procedure: Enabling Self Monitoring In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Manager Configuration Monitoring. Click Enable services. Restart Tomcat and Taskomatic. Navigate to the URL of your Prometheus server, on port 9090 (for example, http://example.com:9090) In the Prometheus UI, navigate to Status Targets and confirm that all the endpoints on the mgr-server group are up. If you have also installed Grafana with the Web UI, the server insights are visible on the Uyuni Server dashboard, in the Admin Manager Configuration Monitoring. Only server self-health monitoring can be enabled using the Web UI. Metrics for a proxy are not automatically collected by Prometheus. To enable self-health monitoring on a proxy, you need to manually install exporters and enable them. The following relevant metrics are collected on the Uyuni Server. Table 1. Server statistics (port 80) Metric Type Description uyuni_all_systems gauge Number of all systems uyuni_virtual_systems gauge Number of virtual systems uyuni_inactive_systems gauge Number of inactive systems uyuni_outdated_systems gauge Number of systems with outdated packages Table 2. PostgreSQL exporter (port 9187) Metric Type Description pg_stat_database_tup_fetched counter Number of rows fetched by queries pg_stat_database_tup_inserted counter Number of rows inserted by queries pg_stat_database_tup_updated counter Number of rows updated by queries pg_stat_database_tup_deleted counter Number of rows deleted by queries mgr_serveractions_completed gauge Number of completed actions mgr_serveractions_failed gauge Number of failed actions mgr_serveractions_picked_up gauge Number of picked-up actions mgr_serveractions_queued gauge Number of queued actions Table 3. JMX exporter (Tomcat port 5556, Taskomatic port 5557) Metric Type Description java_lang_Threading_ThreadCount gauge Number of active threads java_lang_Memory_HeapMemoryUsage_used gauge Current heap memory usage Table 4. Server Message Queue (port 80) Metric Type Description message_queue_thread_pool_threads counter Number of message queue threads ever created message_queue_thread_pool_threads_active gauge Number of currently active message queue threads message_queue_thread_pool_task_count counter Number of tasks ever submitted message_queue_thread_pool_completed_task_count counter Number of tasks ever completed Table 5. Salt Queue (port 80) Metric Type Description salt_queue_thread_pool_size gauge Number of threads created per Salt queue salt_queue_thread_pool_active_threads gauge Number of currently active Salt threads per queue salt_queue_thread_pool_task_total counter Number of tasks ever submitted per queue salt_queue_thread_pool_completed_task_total counter Number of tasks ever completed per queue Every salt_queue value has a label named queue with the queue number as value. Table 6. Taskomatic Scheduler (port 9800) Metric Type Description taskomatic_scheduler_threads counter Number of scheduler threads ever created taskomatic_scheduler_threads_active gauge Number of currently active scheduler threads taskomatic_scheduler_completed_task_count counter Number of tasks ever completed Prometheus metrics exporters can be installed and configured on Salt clients using formulas. The packages are available from the Uyuni client tools channels, and can be enabled and configured directly in the Uyuni Web UI. These exporters can be installed on managed systems: Node exporter: golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter. PostgreSQL exporter: prometheus-postgres_exporter. See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter. Apache exporter: golang-github-lusitaniae-apache_exporter. See https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter. On SLE Micro, only the Node exporter and the Blackbox exporter are available. When you have the exporters installed and configured, you can start using Prometheus to collect metrics from the monitored systems. If you have configured your monitoring server with the Web UI, metrics collection happens automatically. Procedure: Configuring Prometheus Exporters on a Client In the Uyuni Web UI, open the details page of the client to be monitored, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Check the Enabled checkbox on the Prometheus Exporters formula. Click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Prometheus Exporters tab. Select the exporters you want to enable and customize arguments according to your needs. The Address field accepts either a port number preceded by a colon (:9100), or a fully resolvable address (example:9100). Click Save Formula. Apply the highstate. Monitoring formulas can also be configured for System Groups, by applying the same configuration used for individual systems inside the corresponding group. For more information about the monitoring formulas, see Monitoring Formula. To change the Grafana password follow the steps described in the Grafana documentation: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/user-management/user-preferences/#change-your-grafana-password In case you have lost the Grafana administrator password you can reset it as root with the following command: grafana-cli --configOverrides cfg:default.paths.data=/var/lib/grafana --homepath /usr/share/grafana admin reset-admin-password <new_password> Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to monitored clients. By default, Prometheus uses these ports: Node exporter: 9100 PostgreSQL exporter: 9187 Apache exporter: 9117 Additionally, if you are running the alert manager on a different host than where you run Prometheus, you also need to open port 9093. The alert manager is part of Prometheus solution. It handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server instance. For more information about the alert manager, see https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/. For clients installed on cloud instances, you can add the required ports to a security group that has access to the monitoring server. Alternatively, you can deploy a Prometheus instance in the exporters' local network, and configure federation. This allows the main monitoring server to scrape the time series from the local Prometheus instance. If you use this method, you only need to open the Prometheus API port, which is 9090. For more information on Prometheus federation, see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/. You can also proxy requests through the network boundary. Tools like PushProx deploy a proxy and a client on both sides of the network barrier and allow Prometheus to work across network topologies such as NAT. For more information on PushProx, see https://github.com/RobustPerception/PushProx. Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to each exporter on the monitored clients. To simplify your firewall configuration, you can use reverse proxy for your exporters to expose all metrics on a single port. Procedure: Installing Prometheus Exporters with Reverse Proxy In the Uyuni Web UI, open the details page of the system to be monitored, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Check the Prometheus Exporters checkbox to enable the exporters formula, and click Save. Navigate to the Prometheus Exporters tab in the top menu. Check the Enable reverse proxy option, and enter a valid reverse proxy port number. For example, 9999. Customize the other exporters according to your needs. Click Save Formula. Apply the highstate and confirm that it completes successfully. For more information about the monitoring formulas, see Monitoring Formula. Prometheus server and Prometheus node exporter offer a built-in mechanism to secure their endpoints with TLS encryption and authentication. Uyuni Web UI simplifies the configuration of all involved components. The TLS certificates have to be provided and deployed by the user. Uyuni offers enabling the following security model: Node exporter: TLS encryption and client certificate based authentication Prometheus: TLS encryption and basic authentication For more information about configuring all available options, see Monitoring Formula. By default, Uyuni does not provide any certificates for securing monitoring configuration. For providing security, you can generate or import custom certificates, self-signed or signed by a third party certificate authority (CA). This section demonstrates how to generate client/server certificates for Prometheus and Node exporter minions self-signed with Uyuni CA. Procedure: Creating server/client TLS certificate On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, run following command: rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-email=\"name@example.com\" \\ --set-hostname=\"minion.example.com\" --set-cname=\"minion.example.com\" --no-rpm Ensure that the set-cname parameter is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Salt client. You can use the the set-cname parameter multiple times if you require multiple aliases. Copy server.crt and server.key files to the Salt minion and provide read access for prometheus user.","title":"Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"monitoring","url":"/uyuni/administration/monitoring.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It allows you to schedule and view compliance scans for any client. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a synthesis of interoperable specifications derived from community ideas. It is a line of specifications maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for maintaining system security for enterprise systems. SCAP was created to provide a standardized approach to maintaining system security, and the standards that are used continually change to meet the needs of the community and enterprise businesses. New specifications are governed by NIST’s SCAP Release cycle to provide a consistent and repeatable revision work flow. For more information, see: https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol https://www.open-scap.org/features/standards/ https://ncp.nist.gov/repository?scap Uyuni uses OpenSCAP to implement the SCAP specifications. OpenSCAP is an auditing tool that utilizes the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF). XCCDF is a standard way of expressing checklist content and defines security checklists. It also combines with other specifications such as Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE), and Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL), to create a SCAP-expressed checklist that can be processed by SCAP-validated products. OpenSCAP verifies the presence of patches by using content produced by the SUSE Security Team. OpenSCAP checks system security configuration settings and examines systems for signs of compromise by using rules based on standards and specifications. For more information about the SUSE Security Team, see https://www.suse.com/support/security. Before you begin, you need to prepare your client systems for SCAP scanning. OpenSCAP auditing is not available on Salt clients that use the SSH contact method. Scanning clients can consume a lot of memory and compute power on the client being scanned. For Red Hat clients, ensure you have at least 2 GB of RAM available on each client to be scanned. Install the OpenSCAP scanner and the SCAP Security Guide (content) packages on the client before you begin. Depending on the operating system, these packages are included either on the base operating system, or in the Uyuni Client Tools. The table below lists the packages you need: Table 1. OpenSCAP packages Operating system Scanner Content SLES openscap-utils scap-security-guide openSUSE openscap-utils scap-security-guide RHEL openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat CentOS openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Oracle Linux openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Ubuntu libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-ubuntu Debian libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-debian RHEL 7 and compatible systems provide a scap-security-guide package, which contains outdated contents. You are advised to use the scap-security-guide-redhat package you will find in the Uyuni Client Tools. SUSE provides the scap-security-guide package for different openscap profiles. In the current version of scap-security-guide, SUSE supports the following profiles: DISA STIG profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 15 ANSSI-BP-028 profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 15 PCI-DSS profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 15 HIPAA profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 CIS profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 15 Hardening for Public Cloud Image of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 Public Cloud Hardening for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Standard System Security profile for SLE 12 and 15 Any other profile out of this lists are community supplied and not officially supported by SUSE. For Non-SUSE operating systems the included profiles are community supplied. They are not officially supported by SUSE. OpenSCAP uses SCAP content files to define test rules. These content files are created based on the XCCDF or OVAL standards. In addition to the SCAP Security Guide, you can download publicly available content files and customize it to your requirements. You can install the SCAP Security Guide package for default content file templates. Alternatively, if you are familiar with XCCDF or OVAL, you can create your own content files. We recommend you use templates to create your SCAP content files. If you create and use your own custom content files, you do so at your own risk. If your system becomes damaged through the use of custom content files, you might not be supported by SUSE. When you have created your content files, you need to transfer the file to the client. You can do this in the same way as you move any other file, using physical storage media, or across a network with Salt (for example, salt-cp or the Salt File Server), ftp or scp. We recommend that you create a package to distribute content files to clients that you are managing with Uyuni. Packages can be signed and verified to ensure their integrity. For more information, see Custom Channels. Different operating systems make available different OpenSCAP content files and profiles. One content file may contain more than one profile. On RPM-based operating systems, use this command to determine the location of the available SCAP files: rpm -ql <scap-security-guide-package-name-from-table> On DEB-based operating systems, use this command to determine the location of the available SCAP files: dpkg -L <scap-security-guide-package-name-from-table> When you have identified one SCAP content file that suits your needs, list profiles available on the client: oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml Document type: Source Data Stream Imported: 2021-03-24T18:14:45 Stream: scap_org.open-scap_datastream_from_xccdf_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml Generated: (null) Version: 1.2 Checklists: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml Status: draft Generated: 2021-03-24 Resolved: true Profiles: Title: CIS SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Benchmark Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis Title: Standard System Security Profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard Title: DISA STIG for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig Referenced check files: ssg-sle15-oval.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 ssg-sle15-ocil.xml system: http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2 https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/suse.linux.enterprise.15.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 Checks: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-oval.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-ocil.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-oval.xml Dictionaries: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-dictionary.xml Take a note of the file paths and profiles for performing the scan. When you have installed or transferred your content files, you can perform audit scans. Audit scans can be triggered using the Uyuni Web UI. You can also use the Uyuni API to schedule regular scans. Procedure: Running an Audit Scan from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client you want to scan. Navigate to the Audit tab, and the Schedule subtab. In the Path to XCCDF Document field, enter the parameters for the SCAP template and profile you want to use on the client.

In addition, you may need to increase the value of file_recv_max_size. The scan runs at the client’s next scheduled synchronization. The XCCDF content file is validated before it is run on the remote system. If the content file includes invalid arguments, the test fails. Procedure: Running an Audit Scan from the API Before you begin, ensure that the client to be scanned has Python and XML-RPC libraries installed. Choose an existing script or create a script for scheduling a system scan through system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan. For example: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('https://server.example.com/rpc/api') key = client.auth.login('username', 'password') client.system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan(key, <1000010001>, '<path_to_xccdf_file.xml>', '--profile <profile_name>') client.auth.logout(session_key) In this example: * <1000010001> is the system ID (sid). * <path_to_xccdf_file.xml> is the path to the content file location on the client. For example, /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml. * <profile_name> is an additional argument for the oscap command. For example, use united_states_government_configuration_baseline (USGCB). Run the script on the client you want to scan, from the command prompt. Information about the scans you have run is in the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to to Audit OpenSCAP All Scans for a table of results. For more information about the data in this table, see All Scans. To ensure that detailed information about scans is available, you need to enable it on the client. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations and click on the organization the client is a part of. Navigate to the Configuration tab, and check the Enable Upload of Detailed SCAP Files option. When enabled, this generates an additional HTML file on every scan, which contains extra information. The results show an extra line similar to this: Detailed Results: xccdf-report.html xccdf-results.xml scap-yast2sec-oval.xml.result.xml To retrieve scan information from the command line, use the spacewalk-report command: spacewalk-report system-history-scap spacewalk-report scap-scan spacewalk-report scap-scan-results You can also use the Uyuni API to view results, with the system.scap handler. Remediation Bash scripts and Ansible playbooks are provided in the same SCAP Security Guide packages to harden the client systems. For example: Listing 1. bash scripts /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-cis.sh /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-standard.sh /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-stig.sh Listing 2.

Install the scap-security-guide package on all your target systems. For more information, see Setup Ansible Control Node. Packages, channels and scripts are different for each operating system and distribution. Examples are listed in the Example remediation Bash scripts section. Run the Bash script as a remote command on single systems. From System Overview tab, select your instance. Then in Details Remote Commands, write a Bash script such as: #!/bin/bash chmod +x -R /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-stig.sh Click Schedule. Folder and script names change between distribution and version. Examples are listed in the Example remediation Bash scripts section. Run the Bash script as a remote command on multiple systems at once. When a system group has been created click System Groups, select Use in SSM from the table. From the System Set Manager, under Misc Remote Command, write a Bash script such as: #!/bin/bash chmod +x -R /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-stig.sh Click Schedule.

For most environments, a single organization is enough. However, more complicated environments might need several organizations. You might like to have an organization for each physical location within your business, or for different business functions. When you have created your organizations, you can create and assign users to your organizations. You can then assign permissions on an organization level, which applies by default to every user assigned to the organization. You can also configure authentication methods for your new organization, including PAM and single sign-on. For more information about authentication, see Authentication Methods. You must be logged in as the Uyuni administrator to create and manage organizations. Procedure: Creating a New Organization In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations, and click Create Organization. In the Create Organization dialog, complete these fields: In the Organization Name field, type a name for your new organization. The name should be between 3 and 128 characters long. In the Desired Login field, type the login name you want to use for the organization’s administrator. This must be a new administrator account, you are not be able to use an existing administrator account to sign in to the new organization, including the one you are currently signed in with. In the Desired Password field, type a password for the new organization’s administrator. Confirm the password by typing it again in the Confirm Password field. Password strength is indicated by the colored bar beneath the password fields. In the Email field, type an email address for the new organization’s administrator. In the First Name field, select a salutation, and type a given name for the new organization’s administrator. In the Last Name field, type a surname for the new organization’s administrator. Click Create Organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations to see a list of available organizations. Click the name of an organization to manage it. From the Admin Organizations section, you can access tabs to manage users, trusts, configuration, and states for your organization. Organizations can only be managed by their administrators. To manage an organization, ensure you are signed in as the correct administrator for the organization you want to change. Navigate to the Users tab to view the list of all users associated with the organization, and their role. Clicking a username takes you to the Users menu to add, change, or delete users. Navigate to the Trusts tab to add or remove trusted organizations. Establishing trust between organizations allow them to share content between them, and gives you the ability to transfer clients from one organization to another. Navigate to the Configuration tab to manage the configuration of your organization. This includes the use of staged contents, and the use of SCAP files. For more information about content staging, see Content Staging. For more information about OpenSCAP, see OpenSCAP. Navigate to the States tab to manage Salt states for all clients in your organization. States allow you to define global security policies, or add a common admin user to all clients. For more information about Salt States, see Salt States and Pillars. You can select which configuration channels should be applied across your organization. Configuration channels can be created in the Uyuni Web UI by navigating to Configuration Channels. Apply configuration channels to your organization using the Uyuni Web UI. Procedure: Applying Configuration Channels to an Organization In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Configuration Channels. Use the search feature to locate a channel by name. Check the channel to be applied and click Save Changes. This saves to the database, but does not apply the changes to the channel. Apply the changes by clicking Apply.

When a new patch gets released by the vendor, it might happen that the patch has undesirable side effects (security, stability) in some scenario that was not identified by testing. When this happens (very rarely), vendors typically release a new patch, which may take hours or days, depending on the internal processes in place by that vendor. SUSE has introduced a new mechanism (2021) called \"retracted patches\" to revoke such patches almost immediately by setting their advisory status to \"retracted\" (instead of \"final\" or \"stable\"). A patch is \"retracted,\" when its advisory status attribute is set to \"retracted.\" A package is \"retracted,\" when it belongs to a \"retracted\" patch. A retracted patch or package cannot be installed on systems with Uyuni. The only way to install a retracted package, is to do it manually with zypper install and specifying the exact package version. For example: zypper install vim-8.0.1568-5.14.1 Retracted status of patches and packages is depicted with the icon in the Web UI of Uyuni. For example, see: list of packages in a channel list of patches in a channel When a patch or package, that has been installed on a system, gets retracted, the icon is also displayed in the installed packages list of that system. Uyuni does not provide a way to downgrade such a patch or package. When using cloned channels, you must pay attention to the propagation of the retracted advisory status from the original channels to the clones. Upon cloning vendor channels into your organization, channel patches will be cloned as well. When the vendor retracts a patch in a channel and Uyuni synchronizes this channel (for example, with the nightly job), the \"retracted\" attribute will not get propagated to the cloned patches and will not be observed by the clients subscribed to cloned channels. To propagate the attribute to your cloned channels use one of the following ways: Patch Sync (Software Manage cloned channel Patches Sync). This function allows you to align the attributes of patches in your cloned channel to their originals. Content Lifecycle Management. For more information about cloned channels in the context of Content Lifecycle Management, see Software Channels. When you create multiple vendor channel clones in your organization, the patches are not cloned multiple times, but are shared between cloned channels. As a consequence, when you synchronize your cloned patch (either using the patch sync function or with Content Lifecycle Management mentioned above), all channels using the cloned patch will observe that change. Example: Consider two Content Lifecycle Management projects prj1 and prj2 Both of these projects have 2 environments dev and test Both of these projects have a vendor channel set as a source channel All channels in this scenario (four cloned channels in total) are aligned to the latest state of the vendor channels Vendor retracts a patch in the source channel and the nighly job synchronizes it to your Uyuni None of the four channels see this change because they are using a patch clone, not the patch directly. As soon as you synchronize your patch (either you build any of these two projects, or you use the Patch Sync function on any of the four cloned channels), due to the patch sharing, ALL of the cloned channels will see the patch as retracted.","title":"Patch Management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"patch-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/patch-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

These PTFs (Program Temporary Fixes) are now available as repositories, which can be synced in Uyuni. PTF packages are installed via a proxy package and are named ptf-xxxxxx, where xxxxxx is a number and part of the name of the package, not its version. They will depend on the correct version of the package that is known to include the correction in the software. This type of package: cannot be installed accidentally (i.e. zypper update will never suggest installing them), cannot be removed accidentally (i.e. a newer package version will not replace the PTF one, unless the user makes it explicitly on the zypper command line), is only updated when the newer version is known to address the specific issue previously solved by the PTF, updates only packages already installed on the system (i.e. if a software is split into multiple packages, the PTF will replace only those currently installed on the system). The correct ID of the package will be provided by SUSE Support during the course of the support case investigation, along with instruction on how to deploy/restart the affected services. PTF packages are currently only supported for SLE 12 and SLE 15 based systems. Other versions or operating systems do not have this feature and the pages are not visible for them. Procedure: Enabling and synchronizing PTF repositories using the command line On the console enter mgr-sync refresh. Enter mgr-sync list channel and look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. For example, a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Enable the PTF channel with mgr-sync add channel <label>. This channel is now available and can be added to every system which is using the same base channel. PTF packages need to be installed explicitly, since they are not automatically picked up when updating a system. The SUSE Customer Support will provide the PTF number to fix a specific problem. With the number the proxy package can be identified in the PTF list. In Uyuni Web UI every system with PTFs available for installation has a page which lists them. Procedure: Enabling and synchronizing PTF repositories via the Uyuni Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Products and look for the product you want to enable the PTF repository for. Click Show product’s channels next to the products sync status. You should see a popup listing mandatory and optional channels for the product. In the optional channels list look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. For example a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Select the channel using the checkbox next to its name and click Confirm to schedule the sync. Note that the product has to be installed to be able to add optional channels to it. Procedure: Installing the PTF packages In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client where you want to install a PTF. Navigate to the Systems Software Packages Software Channels and select the PTF channel. Click Next, and Confirm Software Channel Change with Confirm. To check if the channel assignment is finished, navigate to Systems Events History to see the results. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs Install sub tab. Select the PTF package you want to install. Click Install PTF, and Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Installation with Confirm. To see PTF installation results, navigate to Systems Events History. In case a PTF should be installed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageInstall API can be used with the proxy package name. Once a PTF is confirmed to address the reported issue, the updated package will be tracked for inclusion into a future maintenance update before being widely distributed as an regular maintenance update in the update repositories. When this regular update with the fix is released, an updated version of the PTF will also be released into the account-specific PTF repository. The updated PTF will remove the strict dependencies and allow updates to be installed again. The replacement of the PTF with the maintenance update which includes the fix happens automatically via a standard package update or patch installation. In cases where a PTF needs to be uninstalled and the non-patched version of the packages need to be installed on the system, a simple package remove cannot be used. The PTF package is not selectable in the standard package list page. Procedure: Removing the PTF packages In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client you want to remove a PTF from. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs List/Remove sub tab. Select the ptf package you want to remove. Click Remove PTFs, and on the Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Removal page click Confirm. To see the results, navigate to Systems Events History. Removing PTFs requires a special version of libzypp and zypper to be installed on the client system. Check zypper --help to confirm whether removeptf is supported. The List/Remove tab is only visible if this condition is met. In case the PTF should be removed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageRemove API can be used with the proxy package name. In case a PTF should be removed directly on the client using the console, it is required to use a special command zypper removeptf. All other ways result either in an error or can lead to unwanted behavior like removing important packages from the system and make the system unusable.","title":"Using PTFs in Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"ptfs","url":"/uyuni/administration/ptfs.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The differences common to all reports are: the report data is not changing in real-time, but it’s updated only by the execution of a scheduled task; data duplication has been removed and columns that were previously considered \"multival\" contain now multiple values separated by ;. This also means that the command line options --multival-on-rows and --multival-separator are no longer applicable to the new reports, as their behavior is now the default; in all reports the new columns mgm_id and synced_date have been introduced to identify the management server in the hub scenario and the last time the information was updated from the application database; all boolean values are now represented by the True/False and not by a 1/0 values; the column org_id has been replaced by organization, which contains the organization name and not the numerical identifier; The term \"server\" has been replaced by \"system.\" So, for example, the column server_id is now called system_id. For report specific changes, see List of available reports. If this changed behavior causes trouble, the new option --legacy-report can be used to fall back to the old report, which is executed against the application database.

List of available reports","hash":"report-list","id":3}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security method that restricts resources access to authorized users based on their assigned roles. In Uyuni, RBAC ensures that users can only perform actions and access resources for which they have explicit authorization, enhancing security and simplifying administration. The core principles of RBAC include: Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary access rights for users to perform their tasks. Granular Control: Providing fine-grained control over specific functionalities. Separation of Duties: Preventing a single user from having too much control over critical processes. Auditability: Allowing for clear tracking of user actions and permissions. Understanding the following core concepts is crucial for effective RBAC management: Role: A collection of permissions defining a specific set of capabilities within Uyuni. Roles are assigned to users, granting the user aggregated permissions. Permission: An atomic authorization to perform a specific action, access a specific web page or call a specific API endpoint within Uyuni. In Uyuni, permissions are represented by namespaces and their access modes. User: An individual account that interacts with Uyuni. Users are assigned one or more roles. Namespace: A granular unit of access control organized in a tree-like structure. Most namespaces have distinct \"View\" or \"Modify\" modes. Uyuni provides predefined roles and allows for the definition of additional custom roles, optionally inheriting from a combination of other roles. Refer to administration:users.adoc#administrator-roles for a complete list of predefined roles and their descriptions. To define additional roles, you can: Select a number of existing roles to inherit permissions from. Specify additional namespaces to grant access to. Namespaces provide fine-grained access control, organized in a tree-like structure. For most namespaces, access within a namespace is further granularized by \"View\" and \"Modify\" modes. Table 1. Example: Image Management namespaces and access modes Namespace Access Mode Description cm.build Modify Build container or Kiwi images cm.image.import Modify Import container images from a registered image store cm.image.list View List all images cm.image.list Modify Delete images cm.image.overview View View image details, patches, packages, build log and cluster information cm.image.overview Modify Inspect, rebuild, delete images cm.profile.details View View details of an image profile cm.profile.details Modify Create image profiles, edit profile details cm.profile.list View List all image profiles cm.profile.list Modify Delete image profiles cm.store.details View View details of an image store cm.store.details Modify Create image stores, edit store details cm.store.list View List all image stores cm.store.list Modify Delete image stores A comprehensive list of namespaces and their descriptions can be retrieved by making a call to the access.listNamespaces API method. Refer to Uyuni API documentation for detailed information, including request and response formats. Managing RBAC roles and permissions is currently only possible through the API. To assign roles to users via the web UI, refer to Users. The Uyuni API provides methods for programmaticaly managing roles, permissions and user assignments. These API methods manage roles and their associated access: listNamespaces: Lists available namespaces, access modes and their descriptions in Uyuni. listPermissions: Lists permitted namespaces of a role. listRoles: Lists existing roles in Uyuni. createRole: Creates a new role, optionally copying permissions from existing roles. deleteRole: Deletes a role. grantAccess: Grants access to namespaces. revokeAccess: Revokes access to namespaces. These API methods manage user-role assignments: listPermissions: Lists effective permissions of a user. listRoles: Lists a user’s assigned roles. addRole: Assigns a role to a user. removeRole: Removes a role from a user. For detailed API documentation, including request and response formats, refer to Uyuni API reference. Adhering to these best practices will help maintain a secure, efficient, and manageable RBAC environment: Principle of least privilege: Always grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their duties. Avoid overly broad permissions. Regular review: Periodically review assigned roles and permissions for users to ensure they are still appropriate and comply with current security policies. Document roles: Clearly document the purpose and permissions of each custom role you create. Separate duties: Implement roles that enforce separation of duties to prevent a single user from having too much control over critical processes.","title":"Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"role-based-access-control","url":"/uyuni/administration/role-based-access-control.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Uyuni monitors some directories for free disk space. You can modify which directories are monitored, and the warnings that are created. All settings are configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. When the available space in one of the monitored directories falls below a warning threshold, a message is sent to the configured email address and a notification is shown at the top of the sign-in page. By default, Uyuni monitors these directories: /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk /var/cache /srv You can change which directories are monitored with the spacecheck_dirs parameter. You can specify multiple directories by separating them with a space. For example: spacecheck_dirs = /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk /var/cache /srv For more information about volumes, see https://documentation.suse.com/multi-linux-manager/5.1/en/suse-manager/installation-and-upgrade/container-management/persistent-container-volumes.html. By default, Uyuni creates a warning when a monitored directory has less than 10% of total space available. A critical alert is created when a monitored directory falls below 5% space available. You can change these alert thresholds with the spacecheck_free_alert and spacecheck_free_critical parameters. For example: spacecheck_free_alert = 10 spacecheck_free_critical = 5 By default, Uyuni shuts down the spacewalk services when the critical alert threshold is reached. You can change this behavior with the spacecheck_shutdown parameter. A value of true enables the shut down feature. Any other value disables it. For example: spacecheck_shutdown = true The space checking tool is enabled by default. You can disable it entirely with these commands: systemctl stop spacewalk-diskcheck.timer systemctl disable spacewalk-diskcheck.timer Disabling the spacewalk-diskcheck.timer will stop periodic email alerts if the alert threshold is reached, but the warning notification will still appear at the top of the sign-in page.","title":"Disk Space Management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"space-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/space-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Before you begin, ensure you have: A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate. If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available. An SSL server private key An SSL server certificate An SSL database private key An SSL database certificate All files must be in PEM format. The hostname of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on. You can set the hostnames in the X509v3 Subject Alternative Name section of the certificate. You can also list multiple hostnames if your environment requires it. Supported Key types are RSA and EC (Elliptic Curve). Database SSL certificates require reportdb and db as Subject Alternative Name. Third-party authorities commonly use intermediate CAs to sign requested server certificates. In this case, all CAs in the chain are required to be available. If there is no extra parameter or option available to specify intermediate CAs, take care that all CAs (Root CA and intermediate CAs) are stored in one file. By default, Uyuni uses a self-signed certificate. After you have completed the initial setup, you can replace the default certificate with an imported certificate. Procedure: Import Certificates on a New Uyuni Server Deploy the Uyuni Server according to the instructions in Install Uyuni Server. Make sure to pass the correct files as parameters to mgradm install podman. The parameters are: 3rd Party SSL Certificate Flags: --ssl-ca-intermediate strings Intermediate CA certificate path --ssl-ca-root string Root CA certificate path --ssl-server-cert string Server certificate path --ssl-server-key string Server key path --ssl-db-ca-intermediate strings Intermediate CA certificate path for the database if different from the server one --ssl-db-ca-root string Root CA certificate path for the database if different from the server one --ssl-db-cert string Database certificate path --ssl-db-key string Database key path Intermediate CAs can either be available in the file which is specified with --ssl-ca-root or specified as extra options with --ssl-ca-intermediate. The --ssl-ca-intermediate option can be specified multiple times. By default, Uyuni Proxy uses a self-signed certificate. After you have completed the initial setup, you can replace the default certificate with an imported certificate. Procedure: Import Certificates on a New Uyuni Proxy Install the Uyuni Proxy according to the instructions in Install Uyuni Proxy. Follow the prompts to complete setup. Use the same certificate authority (CA) to sign all server certificates for servers and proxies. Certificates signed with different CAs do not match. You can replace active certificates on your Uyuni installation with a new certificate. To replace the certificates, you can replace the installed CA certificate with the new CA, and then update the database.

For more information on replacing certificates, see administration:ssl-certs-imported.adoc#ssl-certs-import-replace. This section covers how to create or re-create your self-signed certificates on new or existing installation. The hostname of the SSL keys and certificates must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on. If your existing certificates have expired or stopped working for any reason, you can generate a new server certificate from the existing CA.

Every client that uses SSL to register to the Uyuni Server checks that it is connecting to the right server by validating against a server certificate. This process is called an SSL handshake. During the SSL handshake, the client checks that the hostname in the server certificate matches what it expects. The client also needs to check if the server certificate is trusted. Certificate authorities (CAs) are certificates that are used to sign other certificates. All certificates must be signed by a certificate authority (CA) in order for them to be considered valid, and for clients to be able to successfully match against them. In order for SSL authentication to work correctly, the client must trust the root CA. This means that the root CA must be installed on every client. The default method of SSL authentication is for Uyuni to use self-signed certificates. In this case, Uyuni has generated all the certificates, and the root CA has signed the server certificate directly. An alternative method is to use an intermediate CA. In this case, the root CA signs the intermediate CA. The intermediate CA can then sign any number of other intermediate CAs, and the final one signs the server certificate. This is referred to as a chained certificate. If you are using intermediate CAs in a chained certificate, the root CA is installed on the client, and the server certificate is installed on the server. During the SSL handshake, clients must be able to verify the entire chain of intermediate certificates between the root CA and the server certificate, so they must be able to access all the intermediate certificates. There are two main ways of achieving this. In older versions of Uyuni, by default, all the intermediate CAs are installed on the client. However, you could also configure your services on the server to provide them to the client. In this case, during the SSL handshake, the server presents the server certificate as well as all the intermediate CAs. This mechanism is used now as the default configuration. By default, Uyuni uses a self-signed certificate without intermediate CAs. For additional security, you can arrange a third party CA to sign your certificates. Third party CAs perform checks to ensure that the information contained in the certificate is correct. They usually charge an annual fee for this service. Using a third party CA makes certificates harder to spoof, and provides additional protection for your installation. If you have certificates signed by a third party CA, you can import them to your Uyuni installation. This manual describe the use of SSL certificates in two steps: How to create a self-signed certificate with Uyuni tools How to deploy a certificate on Uyuni Server or Proxy In case the certificates are provided by a third party instance like an own or external PKI, step 1 can be skipped.

Uyuni runs a nightly report checking the subscription status of all your registered clients against your SCC account. The report gives you information about which clients consume which subscriptions, how many subscriptions you have remaining and available to use, and which clients do not have a current subscription. Navigate to Audit Subscription Matching to see the report. The Subscriptions Report tab gives information about current and expiring subscriptions. The Unmatched Products Report tab gives a list of clients that do not have a current subscription. This includes clients that could not be matched, or that are not currently registered with Uyuni. The report includes product names and the number of systems that remain unmatched. The Pins tab allows you to associate individual clients to the relevant subscription. This is especially useful if the subscription manager is not automatically associating clients to subscriptions successfully. The Messages tab shows all the messages generated by subscription matcher during the matching process. They provide information to help understand the results and to improve the matching. You can also download the reports in .csv format, or access them from that command prompt in the /var/lib/spacewalk/subscription-matcher/ directory. By default, the subscription matcher runs daily, at midnight. To change this, navigate to Admin Task Schedules and click gatherer-matcher-default. Change the schedule as required, and click Update Schedule. Because the report can only match current clients with current subscriptions, you might find that the matches change over time. The same client does not always match the same subscription. This can be due to new clients being registered or unregistered, or because of the addition or expiration of subscriptions. The subscription matcher automatically attempts to reduce the number of unmatched products, limited by the terms and conditions of the subscriptions in your account. However, if you have incomplete hardware information, unknown virtual machine host assignments, or clients running in unknown public clouds, the matcher might show that you do not have enough subscriptions available. Always ensure you have complete data about your clients included in Uyuni, to help ensure accuracy. The subscription matcher does not always match clients and subscriptions accurately. It is not intended to be a replacement for auditing. If the subscription matcher is not automatically matching a particular client with the correct subscription, you can manually pin them. When you have created a pin, the subscription matcher favors matching a specific subscription with a given system or group of systems. However, the matcher does not always respect a pin. It depends on the subscription being available, and whether or not the subscription can be applied to the client. Additionally, pins are ignored if they result in a match that violates the terms and conditions of the subscription, or if the matcher detects a more accurate match if the pin is ignored. To add a new pin, click Add a Pin, and select the client to pin. We do not recommend using pinning regularly, or for a large number of clients.

Channel Administrator Manages software channels, including making channels globally subscribable, and creating new channels. System Group Administrator Manages systems groups, including creating and deleting system groups, adding clients to existing groups, and managing user access to groups. Regular User Provides standard level of access. Newly created users are automatically assigned to this role. With Role-Based Access Control in Uyuni, you can create additional roles to fine-tune user permissions. Refer to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for more detailed information on how to manage roles. If you have created system groups to manage your clients, you can assign groups to users for them to manage. To assign a user to a system group, navigate to Users User List, click the username to edit, and go to the System Groups tab. Check the groups to assign, and click Update Defaults. You can also select one or more default system groups for a user. When the user registers a new client, it is assigned to the chosen system group by default. This allows the user to immediately access the newly registered client. To manage external groups, navigate to Users System Group Configuration, and go to the External Authentication tab. Click Create External Group to create a new external group. Give the group a name, and assign it to the appropriate system group. For more information about system groups, see System Groups. To see the individual clients a user can administer, navigate to Users User List, click the username to edit, and go to the Systems tab. To carry out bulk tasks, you can select clients from the list to add them to the system set manager. For more information about the system set manager, see System Set Manager. You can assign users to software channels within your organization either as a subscriber that consumes content from channels, or as an administrator, who can manage the channels themselves. To subscribe a user to a channel, navigate to Users User List, click the username to edit, and go to the Channel Permissions Subscription tab.

Preface","hash":"_preface","id":1}]},"50":{"id":50,"text":"Activation keys are used to ensure that your clients have the correct software entitlements, are connecting to the appropriate channels, and are subscribed to the relevant groups. Each activation key is bound to an organization, which you can set when you create the key. In Uyuni, an activation key is a group of configuration settings with a label. You can apply all configuration settings associated with an activation key by adding its label as a parameter to a bootstrap script. We recommend you use an activation key label in combination with a bootstrap script. When the bootstrap script is executed all configuration settings associated with the label are applied to the system the script is run on. An activation key can specify: Channel assignment System types or add-on entitlements Contact method Configuration files Packages to be installed AppStreams to be enabled System group assignment Activation keys are used at the time a client is registered, and not used again. After the client has been registered, the client can be changed in any way, regardless of what the activation key specifies. The association between the activation key and the client is recorded only for historical purposes. Procedure: Creating an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, as an administrator, navigate to Systems Activation Keys. Click the Create Key button. On the Activation Key Details page, in the Description field, enter a description of the activation key. In the Key field, enter a name for the activation key. For example, SLES15-SP7 for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Do not use commas or double quotes in the Key field for any SUSE products. However, you must use commas for Red Hat Products. All other characters are allowed, but <> (){} (this includes the space) are removed automatically. If the field is left empty, a random string is generated. In the Usage add number of times the key can be used, or leave it blank for unlimited usage. In the Base Channels drop-down box, select the appropriate base software channel, and allow the relevant child channels to populate. For more information, see Setup Wizard and Custom Channels. Select the Child Channels you need (for example, the mandatory SUSE Multi-Linux Manager tools and updates channels). Check the Add-On System Types checkbox if you need to enable any of the options. For more information about system types, see System Types. We recommend you leave the Contact Method set to Default. For more information about contact methds, see Client Contact Methods. We recommend you leave the Universal Default setting unchecked. Click Create Activation Key to create the activation key. After the activation key is created, the page shows additional checkbox Configuration File Deployment below the list of Add-On System Types. To enable deploying configuration files to systems on registration, select this checkbox. Click Update Activation Key to save the change. When the activation key creation is completed, additional tabs appear at the top of the page. Use them to check and set additional features. These tabs are: Packages Configuration Groups Activated Systems AppStreams (available whenever a modular channel is associated with the activation key) Reactivation keys can be used once only to re-register a client and regain all Uyuni settings. Reactivation keys are client-specific, and include the system ID, history, groups, and channels. To create a reactivation key, navigate to Systems, click the client to create a reactivation key for, and navigate to the Details Reactivation tab. Click Generate New Key to create the reactivation key. Record the details of the key for later use. Unlike typical activation keys, which are not associated with a specific system ID, keys created here do not show up on the Systems Activation Keys page. After you have created a reactivation key, you can use it as the management_key grain in /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf. For example: grains: susemanager: management_key: \"re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e\" Restart the venv-salt-minion or salt-minion process to apply the reactivation key. You can use a reactivation key with a bootstrap script. For more information about bootstrap scripts, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. If you autoinstall a client with its existing Uyuni profile, the profile uses the reactivation key to re-register the system and restore its settings. Do not regenerate, delete, or use this key while a profile-based autoinstallation is in progress. Doing so causes the autoinstallation to fail. Default Parent Channel Avoid using the Uyuni Default parent channel. This setting forces Uyuni to choose a parent channel that best corresponds to the installed operating system, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, we recommend you create activation keys specific to each distribution and architecture. Bootstrapping With Activation Keys If you are using bootstrap scripts, consider creating an activation key for each script. This helps you align channel assignments, package installation, system group memberships, and configuration channel assignments. You also need less manual interaction with your system after registration. Bootstrapping LTSS Clients If you are boostrapping clients with LTSS subscription, include the LTSS channels during activation key creation. Bandwidth Requirements Using activation keys might result in automatic downloading of software at registration time, which might not be desirable in environments where bandwidth is constrained. These options create bandwidth usage: Assigning a SUSE Product Pool channel results in the automatic installation of the corresponding product descriptor package. Any package in the Packages section is installed. Any Salt state from the Configuration section might trigger downloads depending on its contents. Key Label Naming If you do not enter a human-readable name for your activation keys, the system automatically generates a number string, which can make it difficult to manage your keys. Consider a naming scheme for your activation keys to help you keep track of them. Creating names which are associated with your organization’s infrastructure makes it easier for you when performing more complex operations. When creating key labels, consider these tips: OS naming (mandatory): Keys should always refer to the OS they provide settings for Architecture naming (recommended): Unless your company is running on one architecture only, for example x86_64, then providing labels with an architecture type is a good idea. Server type naming: What is this server being used for? Location naming: Where is the server located? Room, building, or department? Date naming: Maintenance windows, quarter, etc. Custom naming: What naming scheme suits your organizations needs? Example activation key label names: sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le Included Channels When creating activation keys you also need to keep in mind which software channels are associated with it. Keys should have a specific base channel assigned to them. Using the default base channel is not recommended.

One option to prepare such a removable medium is to use Cobbler. For information about using Cobbler to prepare an ISO image, see Build an ISO Image With Cobbler. For SUSE systems, it is often recommended to prepare an ISO image using KIWI. For more information, see Build a SUSE ISO Image With KIWI. In all cases, you use the resulting image to burn a CD-ROM or prepare a USB key. Cobbler can create ISO boot images that contain a set of distributions, kernels, and a menu that works in a similar way to a PXE installation. Building ISOs with Cobbler is not supported on IBM Z. In order to prepare an ISO image with Cobbler, you need to prepare a distribution and a profile, similar to using network boot over PXE. For information about creating a distribution, see Autoinstallable Distributions. For information about creating a profile, see Autoinstallation Profiles. The Cobbler buildiso command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO. Specifying the distribution with --distro is mandatory when running buildiso command. --iso is the output location: mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro=<your-distro-label> You must use distribution and profile labels as listed by Cobbler, and not simply as shown in the Web UI. To list the names of distributions and profiles stored by Cobbler, run the commands: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list mgrctl exec -- cobbler profile list The boot ISO includes all profiles and systems by default. You can limit which profiles and systems are used with the --profiles and --systems options: mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso --systems=\"system1 system2 system3\" \\ --profiles=\"<your-profile1-label> <your-profile2-label> <your-profile3-label>\" \\ --distro=<your-distro-label> With --esp you can enable the built boot ISOs with Secure Boot. You explicitly specify the EFI System Partition (ESP). By default, Cobbler generates the ESP partition, which disables Secure Boot. mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso \\ --esp=\"/usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-15-SP6-x86_64/boot/x86_64/efi\" \\ --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro=<your-distro-label> Procedure: Finding efi On the container host, execute the following command to get the distro name: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list This command outputs strings such as sles15-sp6:1:SUSE. On the container host, execute the following command to get information about the distro files location: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro report --name sles15-sp6:1:SUSE This command outputs a report such as the following: Name : sles15-sp6:1:SUSE Architecture : x86_64 ...output omitted... Initrd : /usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-15-SP6-x86_64/boot/x86_64/loader/initrd Kernel : /usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-15-SP6-x86_64/boot/x86_64/loader/linux ...output omitted... See the contents of the boot directory. In the example above, the boot partition is the /usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-15-SP6-x86_64/boot/x86_64/efi file, but this can differ based on the ISO distributor. If you cannot write an ISO image to a public tmp directory, check your systemd settings in /usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.service. KIWI is an image creation system. You can use KIWI to create a bootable ISO image to be used by the target system for installation of a SUSE system. When the system is rebooted or switched on, it boots from the image, loads the AutoYaST configuration from your Uyuni, and installs SUSE Linux Enterprise Server according to the AutoYaST profile. To use the ISO image, boot the system and type autoyast at the prompt (assuming you left the label for the AutoYaST boot as autoyast). Press Enter to begin the AutoYaST installation. For more information about KIWI, see http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/.

These files include the Linux kernel, an initial RAM disk, and other files required to boot the operating system in installation mode. Uyuni uses the mgradm tool to copy the installation file from the source to the server container. You can extract the needed files from a DVD image. For information, see Distribution Based on an ISO Image. Alternatively, you can install the tftpboot-installation package. For information, see Distribution Based on a RPM Package. You must also have a base channel synchronized on your Uyuni Server for the same operating system version as those files. When you have the files ready, and the base channel synchronized, you need to declare the distribution. This operation associates the installation files to the base channel. The distribution can be referred to by one or more installation profiles. For information, see Declare an Autoinstallable Distribution. This method assumes you have installation media for the operating system you want to install on the clients. This is usually a DVD .iso image that contains the Linux kernel, an initrd file, and other files required to boot the operating system in installation mode. Procedure: Importing Files from Installation Media Use mgradm to import installation data from the ISO image: # mgradm distribution copy <image_name>.iso <image_name> Take a note of the distribution path reported by mgradm. You will need it when you declare the distribution to Uyuni. mgradm is able to automatically detect distribution name and register it to the server. Provided ISO image needs to contain a .treeinfo file. Procedure: Import distribution file with autodetection and registration Use mgradm: # mgradm distribution copy --api-user <username> --api-password <password> <image_name>.iso This method works on SUSE systems. It is simpler than importing contents from an installation media, because it uses prepackaged files for your installation system. Procedure: Extracting Files from an Installation Package On the Uyuni Server, install the package whose name starts with tftpboot-installation. You can determine its exact name with the command zypper se tftpboot-installation You can install the package to different root to avoid need for restart using following command: # mkdir /opt/tftpinstall # zypper --installroot /opt/tftpinstall install tftpboot-installation-SLE-Micro-5.5-x86_64 Find the installation files with the command ls -d /opt/tftpinstall/usr/share/tftpboot-installation/*. Copy installation files using mgradm: # mgradm distribution copy /opt/tftpinstall/usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-Micro-5.5-x86_64 SLE-Micro-5.5-x86_64 Take a note of the distribution path reported by mgradm tool. You will need it when you declare the distribution to Uyuni. After mgradm tool finishes, you can remove /opt/tftpinstall directory. This procedure prepares the installation of the same operating system version as the one that powers your Uyuni Server. If you want to install a different operating system or version on the client, you need to manually get the package tftpboot-installation-* from the distribution it belongs to. In the Package Search input box Uyuni, search the packages whose names start with tftpboot-installation, then look at the package’s details. They show the local path below /var/spacewalk/. The next step after extracting the autoinstallation files is to declare an autoinstallable distribution. Procedure: Declaring an Autoinstallable Distribution In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions. Click Create Distribution, and complete these fields: In the Distribution Label field, enter a name to identify your autoinstallable distribution. In the Tree Path field, enter the path to the installation media saved on your Uyuni Server. Select the matching Base Channel. This must match the installation media. Select the Installer Generation. This must match the installation media. OPTIONAL: Specify kernel options to use when booting this distribution. There are multiple ways to provide kernel options. Only add options here that are generic for the distribution. Click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. The installation files that you prepared might not contain the packages you need to install. If they are not included, add useonlinerepo=1 to the Kernel Options field. The package repositories contain metadata that can be unsigned. If the metadata is unsigned, add insecure=1 to the Kernel Options field, or use your own GPG key as explained in Use Your Own GPG Key. These kernel options are needed for example when you use the \"online installer\" ISO images instead of the full DVD, or when you use the tpboot-installation package. Navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions to manage your autoinstallable distributions. Uyuni is able to combine the kernel options that you assign. This is done using a special inheritance logic. There are three object types that are relevant for this: Distributions (or short \"Distros\") Profiles Systems As a fourth special point of influence on the final kernel options is the Cobbler settings file /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml. The Cobbler settings file defines default kernel options for all distributions. This is not supported in the context of Uyuni. Understanding raw and resolved values is crucial for managing kernel options effectively. Raw values: These refer to values attached directly to a specific Cobbler item and stored as-is in Cobbler’s internal database. Resolved values: These values are dynamically generated at runtime, respecting the inheritance hierarchy of Cobbler items. If you prefix an option with ! then the option will be removed from the final kernel command line. Uyuni will manage the kernel options for both Profiles and Systems for you. As such you may only edit the kernel options for Distros.

There are several ways to install an operating system from Uyuni: in-place, on clients that are already registered; over the network, using PXE boot; preparing an installation CD-ROM or an USB key, and then going to the machine to boot on that medium; as part of the Uyuni for Retail solution. The in-place reinstallation method assumes that a previous operating system has already been installed on the client, and that the client has already been registered to Uyuni. For information about the in-place installation method, see Reinstall Registered Systems. The network boot installation method works on unformatted machines. However, it can only be performed in certain network configurations: the Uyuni Server, or one of its proxies, are on the same local network as the machine you want to install, or you have a DHCP relay that allows you to cross all routers in between; you are able to set up a new DHCP server or to configure an existing one; the client to install is able to boot with PXE, and you can configure it to do so. The removable medium method allows you to bypass these network constraints. However, it assumes the machine is able to read CD-ROMs or USB keys, and boot from them. It also requires physical access to the client machine. For information about the removable media method, see Install via a CD-ROM or a USB key. For information about the Uyuni for Retail approach, see Retail Guide. Autoinstallation of Ubuntu and Debian clients is not supported. These operating systems must be installed manually. The autoinstallation features of Uyuni are based on a software named Cobbler. For more information about Cobbler, see https://cobbler.readthedocs.io. SUSE only supports Cobbler functions that are available in the Uyuni Web UI, or through the Uyuni API. The sole command-line command supported by Cobbler is buildiso. Only supported features are documented here.","title":"Operating System Installation","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-intro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-intro.html","titles":[]},"55":{"id":55,"text":"If the repositories you are using for autoinstallation have unsigned metadata, you usually have to use the insecure=1 kernel parameter as an option of the autoinstallable distribution, and use a spacewalk/sles_no_signature_checks code snippet in the AutoYaST installation file. A safer alternative is to provide your own GPG key. This technique applies to SUSE clients only. Procedure: Include Your Own GPG Key Create a GPG key. Use it to sign the package’s metadata. Add it to the initial RAM disk of your installation media. To copy GPG keys to the container use mgradm gpg add. This command copies the GPG key and adds it to the customer keyring. Run command mgradm restart. This command creates a unique keyring using the SUSE and the customer keyring. When you signed the metadata with your new GPG key, any already onboarded client will not know about the new key. Ideally, you should sign the metadata before you register any client. For already onboarded clients that use those repositories, the workaround is to disable GPG key checking on them.","title":"Use Your Own GPG Key","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-owngpgkey","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-owngpgkey.html","titles":[]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"Within Uyuni, you can use two different types of profiles, depending on the operating system of the clients you want to install: For SUSE Linux Enterprise or openSUSE clients, use AutoYaST. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients, use Kickstart. An autoinstallation profile determines how the operating system will be installed. For example, you can specify additional kernel parameters to be passed to the installer. The most important part of the profile is the autoinstallation file. When you perform an installation manually, you must provide information to the installer, such as partitioning and networking information and user details. The autoinstallation file is a method of providing this information in a scripted form. This type of file is sometimes also referred to as an answers file. You can use both AutoYaST and Kickstart profiles if you want to install clients with different operating systems. For information about how to declare profiles, see Declare the Profile For information about AutoYaST profiles, see AutoYaST Profiles. For information about Kickstart profiles, see Kickstart Profiles. The autoinstallation file contained in the profile can include variables and code snippets. For information about variables and code snippets, see Templates Syntax. When you have prepared an autoinstallation file and distribution, you can create profiles to manage autoinstallation on your Uyuni Server. The profile will determine how to install this distribution you selected. One way to create a profile is to upload an AutoYaST or Kickstart file. Alternatively, for Kickstart only, you can use the Web UI wizard. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallation Profile by Upload In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles. Click Upload Kickstart/AutoYaST File. In the Label field, type a name for the profile. Do not use spaces. In the Autoinstall Tree field, select the autoinstallable distribution to use for this profile. In the Virtualization Type field, select the type of virtualization to use for this profile, or select None if you do not want to use this profile to create a new virtual machine. Copy the contents of your autoinstallation file into the File Contents field, or upload the file directly using the File to Upload field. For more information about the details to include here, see AutoYaST Profiles or Kickstart Profiles. Click Create to create the profile. Procedure: Creating a Kickstart Profile by Wizard In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles. Click Create Kickstart Profile. In the Label field, type a name for the profile. Do not use spaces. In the Base Channel field, select the base channel to use for this profile. This field is populated from the distributions available. If the base channel you need is not available, check that you have created the distribution correctly. In the Virtualization Type field, select the type of virtualization to use for this profile, or select None for no virtualization. Click Next. In the Distribution File Location type the path to the installation media installed on the Uyuni Server. Click Next. Provide a password for the root user on the client. Click Finish. Review the details of your new profile, and customize as required. When you are creating your autoinstallation profile, you can check Always use the newest Tree for this base channel. This setting allows Uyuni to automatically pick the latest distribution that is associated with the specified base channel. If you add new distributions later, Uyuni uses the most recently created or modified. Changing the Virtualization Type usually requires changes to the profile bootloader and partition options. This can overwrite your customization. Verify new or changed settings before saving them, by navigating to the Partitioning tab. The kernel options from the distribution and the profile are combined. You can change the details and settings of your autoinstallation profiles by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and clicking the name of the profile you want to edit. Alternatively, navigate to Systems System List, select the client you want to provision, and navigate to the Provisioning Autoinstallation subtab. An AutoYaST profile consists of a Label that identifies the profile, an Autoinstall Tree that points to an autoinstallable distribution, various options, and, most importantly, an AutoYaST installation file. The AutoYaST installation file is an XML file that give directions to the AutoYaST installer. AutoYaST calls it a \"control file.\" For the full syntax of AutoYaST installation files, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#cha-configuration-installation-options. SUSE provides templates of AutoYaST installation files that you can use as a starting point for your own custom files. You will find the templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles in the AutoYast directory. Each of these profiles requires you to set some variables before you use it. Check the README file included with the script to determine which variables you need. For more information about using variables in AutoYaST scripts, see Variables. Provided AutoYaST templates do not set any user password. Consider setting up root and other user accounts and passwords or other means of authentication. For more information about user accounts in the AutoYaST profiles, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#Configuration-Security-users-and-groups. These are the most important sections in the AutoYaST installation file for installing with Uyuni: <add-on> allows to add child channels to the installation. For an example, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#Software-Selections-additional. `<general>$SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_no_signature_checks')</general> disables signature checks <software> allows to specify product for the Unified Installer See https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#CreateProfile-Software with a \"<software>\" example <init-scripts config:type=\"list\">$SNIPPET('spacewalk/minion_script')</init-scripts> allows the client to register to Uyuni as a Salt client. For more information about AutoYaST, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/. A more recent, Salt-based alternative to AutoYaST, is Yomi. For information about Yomi, see Install with Yomi. Kickstart profiles offer a large number of configuration options. To create these profiles, you can upload them, or use a dedicated wizard. Kickstart profiles allow you to use file preservation lists. If you have many custom configuration files located on a client you want to reinstall with Kickstart, you can save them as a list, and associate that list with the Kickstart profile. Procedure: Creating a File Preservation List In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation File Preservation and click Create File Preservation List. Enter a suitable label, and list absolute paths to all files and directories you want to save. Click Create List. Include the file preservation list in your Kickstart profile. Navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and select the profile you want to edit, go to the System Details File Preservation subtab, and select the file preservation list to include. File preservation lists are limited to a total size of 1 MB. Special devices like /dev/hda1 and /dev/sda1 cannot be preserved. Only use file and directory names, you cannot use regular expression wildcards. For more information about Kickstart, see the Red Hat documentation. Parts of your installation file are replaced during the installation. Variables are replaced with single values, and code snippets are replaced with whole sections of text. Escaped symbols or sections are not replaced. A template engine called Cheetah allows Cobbler to do these replacements. This mechanism allows you to reinstall large numbers of systems, without having to manually create profiles for each of them. You can create autoinstallation variables and code snippets within the Uyuni Web UI. Within a profile, the Autoinstallation File tab allows you to see the result of the substitutions. For information about variables, see Variables. For information about code snippets, see Code Snippets. For information about escaping symbols or text blocks, see Escaping. Autoinstallation variables can be used to substitute values into Kickstart and AutoYaST profiles. To define a variable, from the profile, navigate to the Variables subtab, and create a name=value pair in the text box. For example, you could create a variable that holds the IP address of the client, and another that holds the address of its gateway. Those variables can then be defined for all the clients installed from the same profile. To do that, add these lines to the Variables text box: ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 To use the variable, prepend a $ sign in the profile to substitute the value. For example, the network part of a Kickstart file may look like the following: network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway The $ipaddr is resolved to 192.168.0.28, and the $gateway to 192.168.0.1. In installation files, variables use a hierarchy. System variables take precedence over profile variables, which in turn take precedence over distribution variables. Uyuni comes with a large number of predefined code snippets. Navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Autoinstallation Snippets to see the list of existing snippets. Use a snippet by inserting the $SNIPPET() macro in your autoinstallation file. For example, in Kickstart: $SNIPPET('spacewalk/redhat_register_using_salt') Or, in AutoYaST: <init-scripts config:type=\"list\"> $SNIPPET('spacewalk/minion_script') </init-scripts> The macro is parsed by Cobbler and substituted with the contents of the snippet. You can also store your own code snippets to use in autoinstallation files later on. Click Create Snippet to create a new code snippet. This example sets up a Kickstart snippet for a common hard drive partition configuration: clearpart --all part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary part swap --recommended part pv.00 --size=1 --grow volgroup vg00 pv.00 logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000 Use the snippet with, for example: $SNIPPET('my_partition') If the autoinstallation file contains shell script variables like $(example), the content needs to be escaped with a backslash: \\$(example). Escaping the $ symbol prevents the templating engine from evaluating the symbol as an internal variable. Text blocks such as code fragments or scripts can be escaped by wrapping them with the \\#raw and \\#end raw directives. For example: #raw #!/bin/bash for i in {0..2}; do echo \"$i - Hello World!\" done #end raw Any line with a # symbol followed by a whitespace is treated as a comment and is therefore not evaluated. For example: # start some section (this is a comment) echo \"Hello, world\" # end some section (this is a comment)","title":"Autoinstallation Profiles","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-profiles","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-profiles.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Registration can be achieved in two ways: cloud-init based registration remote execution provisioner based registration Registering by leveraging cloud-init is the preferred way of automatic registering of the newly created virtual machines. This solution avoids configuring an SSH connection to the host. It can also be used regardless of the tool used for client creation. User can pass the set of user data when deploying the image with Terraform, to automatically register the machine to Uyuni. user_data is run only once at bootstrap, and only the first time the machine is started. Before using cloud-init to register clients, the user must configure: Bootstrap script. For more information, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. Activation keys. For more information, see Activation Keys. The following command will download the bootstrap script and register the new machine when it is created. It should be added to the cloud-init configuration: curl -s http://hub-server.tf.local/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-default.sh | bash -s Any time user_data is updated to change the provisioning, Terraform will destroy and then recreate the machines with a new IP, etc. For more information about cloud-init on AWS, see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/template/latest/docs/data-sources/cloudinit_config. For a cloud-init example, see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/cloudinit/latest/docs/data-sources/cloudinit_config#example-usage. The second solution for automatic registering of the newly created virtual machines uses Terraform’s remote-exec provisioner. remote-exec provisioner interacts with the newly created machines. It opens an SSH connection and can run commands on that machine. When using remote-exec provisioner to register clients, the user must ensure that the machine running Terraform will have access to the new virtual machine after its creation. The remaining requirements are the same as when using cloud-init Based Client Registration: Bootstrap script. For more information, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. Activation keys.

Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt To list available logs before tailing, run the following command: mgrctl exec -ti -- ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/ At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You can change how the automated bootstrap repository creation works. This section details the various settings. Flush Mode By default, existing repositories are updated only with the latest packages. You can configure it to always start with an empty repository instead. To enable this behavior, add or edit this value in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_flush = 1 Automatic Mode By default, automated regeneration of the bootstrap repositories is enabled. To disable it, add or edit this value in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: server.susemanager.auto_generate_bootstrap_repo = 0 The tool uses a data file with information about which packages are required for each distribution. The data file is stored at /usr/share/susemanager/mgr_bootstrap_data.py. SUSE updates this file regularly. If you want to makes changes to this file, do not edit it directly. Instead, create a copy in the same directory and edit your copy: cd /usr/share/susemanager/ cp mgr_bootstrap_data.py my_data.py When you have made your changes, configure Uyuni to use the new file. Add or edit this value in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_datamodule = my_data On the next update, the new data from SUSE overwrites the original data file, not the new one. You need to keep the new file up to date with changes provided by SUSE. By default, bootstrap repositories are regenerated daily. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt. Procedure: Generating the Bootstrap Repository for SUSE Linux Enterprise At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, list the available distributions to create bootstrap repositories for: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l Create the bootstrap repository, using the appropriate repository name as the product label: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64 Alternatively, use the number shown next to the distribution name in the list of available distributions. The client repository is located in /srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/. If you have mirrored more than one product (for example, SLES and SLES for SAP), or if you use custom channels, you might need to specify the parent channel to use when creating the bootstrap repository. This is not required in every situation. For example, some SLES 15 versions have common code bases, so there is no need to specify a parent channel. Use this procedure only if your environment requires it. OPTIONAL Procedure: Specifying a Parent Channel for a Bootstrap Repository Check which parent channels you have available: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 Multiple options for parent channel found. Please use option --with-parent-channel <label> and choose one of: - sle-product-sles15-pool-x86_64 - sle-product-sles_sap15-pool-x86_64 - sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64 Specify the appropriate parent channel: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 --with-parent-channel sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64 If you are creating bootstrap repositories that include multiple different architectures, you need to be careful that all architectures are updated correctly. For example, the x86-64 and IBM Z architectures for SLE use the same bootstrap repository URL at /srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/sle/15/2/bootstrap/. When the flush option is enabled, and you attempt to generate the bootstrap repository for multiple architectures, only one architecture is generated. To avoid this, use the --no-flush option at the command prompt when creating additional architectures. For example: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-SP2-x86_64 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --no-flush -c SLE-15-SP2-s390x If you are using custom channels, you can use the --with-custom-channels option with the mgr-create-bootstrap-repo command. In this case, you also need to specify the parent channel to use. Automatic creation of a bootstrap repository might fail if you are using custom channels. In this case, you need to create the repository manually.

Software packages are provided by repositories, and repositories are associated with channels. Subscribing a client to a software channel allows the client to install and update any of the software associated with it. In Uyuni, channels are divided into base channels and child channels. Organizing channels in this way ensures that only compatible packages are installed on each system. A client must be subscribed to only one base channel, assigned during registration based on the client operating system and architecture. For paid channels provided by a vendor, you must have an associated subscription. A base channel consists of packages built for a specific operating system type, version, and architecture. For example, the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86-64 base channel contains only software compatible with that operating system and architecture. A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides only packages that are compatible with the base channel. A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel. When a system has been assigned to a base channel, it is only possible for that system to install the related child channels. For example, if a system has been assigned to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86_64 base channel, they can only install or update packages made available through the compatible base channel, or any of its associated child channels. In the Uyuni Web UI you can browse your available channels by navigating to Software Channel List All. You can modify or create new channels by navigating to Software Manage Channels. For more on using channels, including custom channels, see Channel Management. Handling the Installer Updates Channel after Bootstrapping Once a client system has been bootstrapped, the Installer Updates channel should be removed. The standard update channel already includes the necessary updates, making this channel redundant. Additionally, during migrations, this channel is unnecessary and should not be used. SUSE Package Hub is an extension to SUSE Linux Enterprise products that provides additional open source software provided by the openSUSE community. The packages in SUSE Package Hub are provided by the openSUSE community. They are not supported by SUSE. If you are using SUSE Linux Enterprise operating systems on your clients, you can enable the SUSE Package Hub extension to access these additional packages. This provides the SUSE Package Hub channels, which you can subscribe your clients to. SUSE Package Hub provides a large number of packages, which can take a long time to synchronize and consume a large amount of disk space. Do not enable SUSE Package Hub unless you require the packages it provides. To avoid unintentionally installing or updating unsupported packages, we recommend that you implement a content lifecycle management strategy that initially denies all SUSE Package Hub packages. You can then explicitly enable the specific packages you require. For more information about content lifecycle management, see Content Lifecycle Management. For Red Hat based clients, additional packages are available through AppStream. In most cases, the AppStream packages are required to ensure that you have all the software you need. For Red Hat based clients, additional packages are available through EPEL (extra packages for enterprise Linux). EPEL is an optional package repository that provides additional software. The packages in EPEL are provided by the Fedora community. They are not supported by SUSE. If you are using Red Hat operating systems on your clients, you can enable the EPEL extension to access these additional packages. This provides the EPEL channels, which you can subscribe your clients to. EPEL provides a large number of packages, which can take a long time to synchronize and consume a large amount of disk space. Do not enable the EPEL repositories unless you require the packages it provides. To avoid unintentionally installing or updating unsupported packages, we recommended that you implement a content lifecycle management (CLM) strategy that initially denies all EPEL packages. You can then explicitly enable the specific packages you require. For more information about content lifecycle management, see Content Lifecycle Management. This channel is used by the Unified Installer to ensure it is up to date before it installs the operating system. All SUSE Linux Enterprise products should have access to the installer updates channel during installation. For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server clients the installer updates channel is synchronized by default when you add a product that contains them, and are enabled when you create an autoinstallable distribution with these product channels. For all other SUSE Linux Enterprise variants, including SUSE Linux Enterprise for SAP, you must add the installer updates channel manually. To do this, clone the appropriate SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installer updates channel below the base channel of these SUSE Linux Enterprise variants. When creating an autoinstallable distribution for these SUSE Linux Enterprise variants after the channel was cloned, it is used automatically.","title":"Software Channels","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"channels","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Registering clients to a proxy is similar to registering them directly to the Uyuni Server, with a few key differences. These sections contain information on registering clients to a proxy using the Web UI, commands on the command line, or a bootstrap script. There are also procedures how you can move clients from one Uyuni Proxy to another one or to the Uyuni Server. Within the Web UI, proxy pages show information about clients. You can see a list of clients that are connected to a proxy by clicking the name of the proxy in Systems System List Proxy, then select the Proxy subtab of the Details tab. A list of chained proxies for a client can be seen by clicking the name of the client in Systems All, then select the Connection subtab of the Details tab. You can move clients (Salt) and Salt SSH push clients between proxies without the need to repeat the registration process. You cannot move chained proxies. Instead of moving a chained proxy, create a new proxy, move the clients, and delete the old proxy. Procedure: Moving Clients or Salt SSH Push Client Between Proxies In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the System Details page for the client you want to move between proxies. Navigate to the Connection tab. Then follow the Change proxy link to see the drop-down menu. From the New Proxy drop-down menu select the proxy you want the client to move to, and click Change Proxy. Procedure: Moving Multiple Clients or Salt SSH Push Clients Between Proxies with SSM In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and check each client to move, this adds the clients to the system set manager.

The same functionality is also available with the system.changeProxy API call. The effect of this function differs between normal Salt clients and Salt SSH push clients. The function schedules a Salt state action, which modifies master: setting in the susemanager.conf Salt client configuration file to point to the new proxy. Then the function restarts the Salt client. Changing master: by manually editing the susemanager.conf file has the same effect and is supported, too. When the client restarts and reconnects via the new proxy, the server updates the proxy path in the database and schedules another action for refreshing the channel URLs. The function updates the proxy path immediately in the database and new action for refreshing the channel URLs is scheduled.

Before you can upgrade your clients, you need to make these preparations: Create a content lifecycle project Create an activation key Create an autoinstallable distribution Create an autoinstallation profile Procedure: Creating a Content Lifecycle Project Create a content lifecycle project for your distribution. For more information, see Content Lifecycle Management. Ensure you a choose a short but descriptive name for your project. Include all source channel modules that you require for your distribution. Add filters as required, and set up at least one environment. Procedure: Creating an Activation Key Create an activation key for your distribution. For more information, see Activation Keys. Ensure your activation key includes all filtered project channels. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallable Distribution Create an autoinstallable distribution for every base channel you want to migrate. For more information, see Autoinstallable Distributions. Give your distribution a label that references the name of the content lifecycle project. In the Installer Generation field, select the SLES version you are using. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallation Profile Create an autoinstallation profile for every target distribution and service pack you want to upgrade to. For more information, see Autoinstallation Profiles. You can use variables in the profile to distinguish between the different lifecycle environments. For example autoinstallation profiles, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/AutoYaST. Use these variables in your autointallation profiles for automating in-place upgrades: Listing 1.

Before you start, ensure that the system is up to date and all updates have been installed successfully. The upgrade is controlled by YaST and AutoYaST, it does not use Zypper. Before you can migrate your client from SLE 12 to SLE 15, you need to: Prepare installation media Declare an autoinstallation distribution Create an activation key Create an autoinstallation profile Procedure: Preparing Installation Media On the container host, download an ISO image with the installation sources. Use mgradm to import the installation data from the ISO image: mgradm distribution copy <image_name>.iso <image_name> Take a note of the distribution path reported by mgradm. You will need it when you declare the distribution to Uyuni. This image can be used for multiple autoinstallation distributions. For more information, see Autoinstallable Distributions. Procedure: Declaring an Autoinstallation Distribution In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions. Click Create Distribution , and complete these fields: In the Distribution Label field, enter a name to identify your autoinstallation distribution. For example, sles15sp6-x86_64. * In the Tree Path field, enter the path to the installation media you already saved. * Select the matching Base Channel. This must match the installation media. * Select the Installer Generation. This must match the installation media. * OPTIONAL: Specify kernel options to use when booting this distribution. There are multiple ways to provide kernel options. Only add options here that are generic for the distribution. Click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. For example, to switch from the old SLE 12 base channel to the new SLE 15 channel, you need an activation key. Procedure: Creating an Activation Key In the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys and click Create Key. Enter a description for your key. Enter a key or leave it blank to generate an automatic key. OPTIONAL: If you want to limit the usage, enter your value in the Usage text field. Select the SLE-Product-SLES15-SP6-Pool for x86_64 base channel. OPTIONAL: Select any Add-On System Types. For more information, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/article-modules.html. Click Create Activation Key. Click the Child Channels tab and select the required channels. Click Update Key. Autoinstallation profiles contain all the installation and configuration data needed to install a system. They can also contain scripts to be executed after the installation is complete. For example scripts that you can use as a starting point, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/AutoYaST. For valid AutoYaST upgrade settings, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#CreateProfile-upgrade. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallation Profile In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and upload your autoinstallation profile script. For example scripts that you can use as a starting point, see: https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/AutoYaST. In the Kernel Options field, type autoupgrade=1. Optionally, you can also include the Y2DEBUG=1 option. The debug setting is not required but can help with investigating any future problems you might encounter. Clients running in Azure cloud must add textmode=1 console=ttyS0 to Kernel Options. Paste the autoinstallation profile or use the file upload field. Click Create to save. When the uploaded profile requires variables to be set, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles, select the profile to edit, and navigate to the Variables tab. Specify the required variables, using this format: <key>=<value> Before you begin, check that all the channels referenced in the autoinstallation profile are available and fully synchronized. You can monitor the mirroring progress in /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log. Procedure: Migrating In the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems and select the client to be upgraded. Navigate to the Provisioning tab, and select the autoinstallation profile you uploaded. Click Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish. The system downloads the required files, change the bootloader entries, reboot, and start the upgrade. Next time the client synchronizes with the Uyuni Server, it receives a re-installation job. The re-installation job fetches the new kernel and initrd packages. It also writes a new /boot/grub/menu.lst (GRUB Legacy) or /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (GRUB 2), containing pointers to the new kernel and initrd packages. When the client next boots, it uses grub to boot the new kernel with its initrd. PXE booting is not used during this process. Approximately three minutes after the job was fetched, the client goes down for reboot. For clients, use the spacewalk/minion_script snippet to register the client again after migration has completed.","title":"Major Version Upgrade","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"client-upgrades-major","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/client-upgrades-major.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For example, you can migrate SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6. You can also upgrade clients such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS to SUSE Liberty Linux. Product migration requires that all repositories which are enabled on the client and which should be migrated must be valid, otherwise the migration will abort. Uyuni supports the following migration paths: Product migration is for upgrading within the same major version. You cannot use product migration to migrate from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15. For more information about major upgrades, see Major Version Upgrade. You can also migrate openSUSE Leap to a later minor version or to the corresponding SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SP level, for example: openSUSE Leap 15.5 to 15.6 openSUSE Leap 15.6 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 You can also migrate SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to the corresponding SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications SP level, for example: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP5 In SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and later, SUSE supports service pack skipping if SUSE Customer Center provides it. For example, you can upgrade from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 to SP2, without installing SP1. For supported SUSE Linux Enterprise Server upgrade paths, see https://documentation.suse.com/en-us/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html#sec-upgrade-paths-supported. All recommended extensions are automatically enabled when you migrate. During migration, Uyuni automatically accepts any required licenses (EULAs) before installation. Before starting the product migration: Ensure there are no pending updates or patches. Check the System Status on the client system’s Details Overview page, and install all offered updates or patches. If your client system is not up to date, product migration may fail. Make sure all the channels of the target product are fully synchronized. To check the synchronization status in the Web UI, navigate to the Admin Setup Wizard Products page. Ensure you have a working system backup available, in case of an emergency. Product migration does not have a rollback feature. When the migration procedure has begun, rolling back is not possible. Procedure: Performing a Single System Migration From the Systems Overview page, select a client. From the system details page of the client, navigate to the Software Product Migration tab. Select the target migration path and click Select Channels. From the Product Migration - Channels page select the correct base channel, including Mandatory Child Channels and any additional Optional Child Channels. OPTIONAL: Check Allow Vendor Change to allow packages that have changed vendors to be installed. If this occurs, a notification is shown with details before the migration is started. To migrate openSUSE Leap to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, you must check the Allow Vendor Change option. Click Schedule Migration when your channels have been configured properly. If you want to migrate a large number of clients to the next SP version, you can use Uyuni API calls. The spacecmd commandline tool provides a system_scheduleproductmigration sub command, which can be used to schedule a migration for a large number of clients to the next minor version. The product mass migration operation is dangerous and the process should be tested thoroughly. At least, do a dry-run first. Be careful not to upgrade systems unintentionally. Procedure: Performing a Product Mass Migration List available migration targets, and take note of the system IDs you want to migrate: spacecmd api -- system.listMigrationTargets -A 1000010001 For each system ID, call listMigrationTarget and check that the desired target product is available. If the system ID has an available target, call system.scheduleProductMigration. If the desired target is not available, skip the system. Adapt this template for your environment: target = '[....]' basechannel = 'channel-label' system_ids = [1, 2, 3] session = auth.login(user, pass) for system in system_ids if system.listMigrationTargets(session, system).ident == target system.scheduleProductMigration(session, system, target, basechannel, [], False, <now>) else print \"Cannot migrate to requested target -- skipping system\" endif endfor For this example, a group will be created temporarily to facilitate the mass migration. Procedure: Creating a Mass Product Migration Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click Create Group. Name the group mpm-target-sles15sp3. Only systems subscribed to the same base channel should be added to the created group. In the example, only systems subscribed to SLE-Product-SLES15-SP2-Pool for x86_64 should be added to the group. For more information about adding clients to groups, see System Groups. Procedure: Adding Systems to the Group Get the targets for all the systems in the group by running: spacecmd -- system_listmigrationtargets group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 The command output a string of \"IDs.\" Only select a target, which is reported for all systems. The string is the identifier for the MIGRATIONTARGET of the other command. The spacecmd sub-commands system_scheduleproductmigration and system_listmigrationtargets are looping over all systems that are part of the group. If there are 100 systems in the group, you will see 100 actions scheduled. All systems in the group must support the same migration target. Procedure: Running the Mass Migration Command The syntax for the system_scheduleproductmigration command is as follows: spacecmd -- system_scheduleproductmigration <SYSTEM> <BASE_CHANNEL_LABEL> \\ <MIGRATION_TARGET> [options] For this example to upgrade all systems in the group mpm-target-sles15sp3 from SLES 12 SP2 to SLES 15 SP, enter on the command line: spacecmd -- system_scheduleproductmigration group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 \\ sle-product-sles15-sp3-pool-x86_64 \"[190,203,195,1242]\" -d To see syntax usage and options for system_scheduleproductmigration, run: spacecmd system_scheduleproductmigration help <SYSTEM> For this example we will use the group we created to select all of the systems from that group: group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 <BASE_CHANNEL_LABEL> This is the label for the target base channel. In this case, the system is being upgraded to SLES 15 SP3, and the label is sle-product-sles15-sp3-pool-x86_64. To see a list of all base channels currently mirrored, run: spacecmd softwarechannel_listbasechannels Keep in mind you cannot upgrade to a channel unless it is an available target for your current base channel. <MIGRATION_TARGET> To identify this value for systems in the group group:mpm-target-sles15sp3, run: spacecmd -- system_listmigrationtargets group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 The MIGRATION_TARGET parameter must be passed in the following format; note necessary shell quotation to prevent sideeffects with brackets: \"[190,203,195,1242]\" Options -s START_TIME -d pass this flag, if you want to do a dry run (it is recommended to run a dry run before the actual migration) -c CHILD_CHANNELS (comma-separated child channels labels with no spaces) In this case we included the -d option, which can be removed after a successful dry run. If successful, the command output for each scheduled system will look like this: Scheduling Product migration for system mpm-sles152-1 Scheduled action ID: 66 You can also track the action, in this case the dry run, in the Web UI for a given system in the group. From the system details page of the client, navigate to Events History. If there are any failures during the dry run, the system should be investigated. If all is well, the -d option can be removed from the command to run the real migration. After the migration is complete, you can reboot the system from the Uyuni Web UI.","title":"Product Migration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"client-upgrades-product-migration","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/client-upgrades-product-migration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the AlmaLinux 8 client. If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the spacecmd package will fail. You might notice some disparity in the number of packages available in the AppStream channel between upstream and the Uyuni channel. You might also see different numbers if you compare the same channel added at a different point in time. This is due to the way that AlmaLinux manages their repositories. AlmaLinux removes older version of packages when a new version is released, while Uyuni keeps all of them, regardless of age. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt To list available logs before tailing, run the following command: mgrctl exec -ti -- ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/ At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your AlmaLinux channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed.

This section is only applicable to non-containerized Uyuni and it will be removed after CentOS 7 will go end-of-life. When you update CentOS clients, the packages do not include metadata about the updates. You can use a third-party errata service to obtain this information. The authors of CEFS provide patches or errata on a best-effort basis, in the hope they are useful but with no guarantees of correctness or currency. This could mean that the patch dates could be incorrect, and in at least one case, the published data was shown to be more than a month old. For more information on these cases, see https://github.com/stevemeier/cefs/issues/28#issuecomment-656579382 and https://github.com/stevemeier/cefs/issues/28#issuecomment-656573607. Any problems or delays with the patch data might result in unreliable patch information being imported to your Uyuni Server. This would cause reports, audits, CVE updates, or other patch-related information to also be incorrect. Please consider alternatives to using this service, such as independently verifying patch data, or choosing a different operating system, depending on your security-related requirements and certifications criteria. Procedure: Installing an Errata Service On the Uyuni Server, from the command prompt, as root, add the sle-module-development-tools module: SUSEConnect --product sle-module-development-tools/15.2/x86_64 Install errata service dependencies: zypper in perl-Text-Unidecode Add or edit this line in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: java.allow_adding_patches_via_api = centos7-x86_64-updates,centos7-x86_64,centos7-x86_64-extras Restart Tomcat: systemctl restart tomcat Create a file for your errata script: touch /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh Edit the new file to include this script, editing the repository details as required.

Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. Debian clients can require multiple GPG keys to be installed. When synchronizing third-party Debian repositories, you will need to import the appropriate GPG key on the server. If the GPG key is missing, synchronization will fail. For Debian repositories, only the metadata is signed. Therefore importing a GPG key for the software channel is not needed. Packages will not be re-signed by Uyuni. To see which GPG keys are already imported to Uyuni Server, run the following command: mgrctl exec -- gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys To import a new GPG key, run the following command: mgradm gpg add <filename>.gpg The root user on Debian is disabled by default for SSH access. To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the sudoers file. Procedure: Granting Root User Access On the client, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file.

When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository.

You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your openEuler channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Operating systems either trust their own GPG keys directly or at least ship them installed with the minimal system. But third party packages signed by a different GPG key need manual handling. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Because Debian based systems sign only metadata, there is no need to specify extra keys for single channels. If a user configures an own GPG key to sign the metadata as described in \"Use Your Own GPG Key\" in Repository Metadata the deployment and trust of that key is executed automatically. Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. By providing some pillar data and providing the GPG key files in the Salt filesystem, they are automatically deployed to the client. These keys are deployed into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ on RPM based operating systems and to /usr/share/keyrings/ on Debian systems: Define the pillar key [literalcustom_gpgkeys for the client you want to deploy the key to and list the names of the key file. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg Additionally in the Salt filesystem create a directory named gpg and store there the GPG key files with the name specified in the custom_gpgkeys pillar data. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg. The last step is to add the URL to the GPG key URL field of the software channel. Navigate to Software Manage Channels and select the channel you want to modify. Add to GPG key URL the value file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key. Procedure: Trusting GPG Keys on Clients Using a Bootstrap Script On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the channel assigned to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. A software channel cannot be assigned to a client when the GPG key is not trusted. openEuler clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.

An instance started from an on-demand image provided by SUSE is automatically registered, and the update infrastructure and SUSE Linux Enterprise modules are activated. To use your on-demand image as a Uyuni client, you need to disable this automation before you begin. Procedure: Preparing On-demand Images Log in to the on-demand instance. At the command prompt, as root, remove the registration data and repositories: registercloudguest --clean Remove the trigger service for automatic registration: systemctl disable guestregister.service in Microsoft Azure, there is an additional service that needs to be disabled: systemctl disable regionsrv-enabler-azure.timer In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping, then fill in the Host, SSH Port, User, and Password fields. Make sure you use stable FQDNs for the Host field, or Uyuni cannot find your host when your Public Cloud gives you a different short-lived FQDNS. Public cloud images usually do not allow SSH login with username and password, but only SSH with a certificate. If you want to use bootstrap from the Web UI, you need to enable SSH login with username and SSH key. You can do this by navigating to Systems Bootstrapping and changing the authentication method. If your cloud provider is Microsoft Azure, you can log in with username and password. To do this, you need to allow the AzureUser to run commands as root without a password. To do this, open the /etc/sudoers.d/waagent file, and add or edit this line: AzureUser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL Allowing the AzureUser to run commands as root without a password carries a security risk. Use this method for testing only. Do not do this for production systems. When the bootstrap process has completed successfully, your client is listed at Systems System List. If you want more control over the process or have to register many clients, create a bootstrap script. For more information, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. For Salt clients and even more control over the process, executing single commands on the command line can be useful. For more information, see Register Clients on the Command Line. When registering clients launched from a public cloud image (for example, AWS AMI), you need to do some additional configuration to prevent them from over-writing each other. For more information about registering clones, see Troubleshooting Registering Cloned Clients. Activation keys are used to ensure that your clients have the correct software entitlements, are connecting to the appropriate channels, and are subscribed to the relevant groups.

Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. Raspberry Pi OS clients can require multiple GPG keys to be installed. When synchronizing third-party Raspberry Pi OS repositories, you will need to import the appropriate GPG key on the server. If the GPG key is missing, synchronization will fail. For Raspberry Pi OS repositories, only the metadata is signed. Therefore importing a GPG key for the software channel is not needed. Packages will not be re-signed by Uyuni. To see which GPG keys are already imported to Uyuni Server, run the following command: mgrctl exec -- gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys To import a new GPG key, run the following command: mgradm gpg add <filename>.gpg The root user on Raspberry Pi OS is disabled by default for SSH access. To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the sudoers file. Procedure: Granting Root User Access On the client, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace <user> with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository.

For information about using Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) instead, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients with RHUI. You are responsible for arranging access to Red Hat base media repositories and RHEL installation media, as well as connecting Uyuni Server to the Red Hat content delivery network. You must obtain support from Red Hat for all your RHEL systems. If you do not do this, you might be violating your terms with Red Hat. Red Hat clients require a Red Hat certificate authority (CA) and entitlement certificate, and an entitlement key. Entitlement certificates are embedded with expiration dates, which match the length of the support subscription. To avoid disruption, you need to repeat this process at the end of every support subscription period. Red Hat supplies a subscription manager tool to manage subscription assignments. It runs locally to track installed products and subscriptions. Clients must be registered with the subscription manager to obtain certificates. Red Hat clients use a URL to replicate repositories. The URL changes depending on where the Red Hat client is registered. Red Hat clients can be registered in three different ways: Red Hat content delivery network (CDN) at redhat.com Red Hat Satellite Server Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) in the cloud This guide covers clients registered to Red Hat CDN. You must have at least one system registered to the CDN, with an authorized subscription for repository content. For information about using Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) instead, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients with RHUI. Satellite certificates for client systems require a Satellite server and subscription. Clients using Satellite certificates are not supported with Uyuni Server. Entitlement certificates are embedded with expiration dates, which match the length of the support subscription. To avoid disruption, you need to repeat this process at the end of every support subscription period. Red Hat supplies the subscription-manager tool to manage subscription assignments. It runs locally on the client system to track installed products and subscriptions. Register to redhat.com with subscription-manager, then follow this procedure to obtain certificates. Procedure: Registering Clients to Subscription Manager On the client system, at the command prompt, register with the subscription manager tool: subscription-manager register Enter your Red Hat Portal username and password when prompted. Run command: subscription-manager activate Copy your entitlement certificate and key from the client system, to a location that the Uyuni Server can access: cp /etc/pki/entitlement/ /<example>/entitlement/ Your entitlement certificate and key both have a file extension of .pem. The key also has key in the filename. Copy the Red Hat CA Certificate file from the client system, to the same web location as the entitlement certificate and key: cp /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem /<example>/entitlement To manage repositories on your Red Hat client, you need to import the CA and entitlement certificates to the Uyuni Server. This requires that you perform the import procedure three times, to create three entries: one each for the entitlement certificate, the entitlement key, and the Red Hat certificate. Procedure: Importing Certificates to the Server On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation GPG and SSL Keys. Click Create Stored Key/Cert and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate: In the Description field, type Entitlement-Cert-date. In the Type field, select SSL.

The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. To mirror the software from the Red Hat CDN, you need to create custom channels and repositories in Uyuni that are linked to the CDN by a URL. You must have entitlements to these products in your Red Hat Portal for this to work correctly. You can use the subscription manager tool to get the URLs of the repositories you want to mirror: subscription-manager repos You can use these repository URLs to create custom repositories. This allows you to mirror only the content you need to manage your clients. You can only create custom versions of Red Hat repositories if you have the correct entitlements in your Red Hat Portal.

On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys. For each the Activation Keys you used for RHEL systems, click on it and: Navigate to the Groups tab, and the Join subtab. Check Select rhel-systems. Click Join Selected Groups. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. For the Red Hat custom channels, if you want to check the Enable GPG Check field, you need to populate the GPG Key URL field. You can use the file URL of the GPG key stored in the directory /etc/pki/rpm-gpg of the Red Hat minion. Example: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release For the complete list of the Red Hat product signing keys, see https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt on the container host: mgrctl exec -ti mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux Clients with CDN","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-rh-cdn","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-rh-cdn.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

If you are running clients in a public cloud, such as Amazon EC2, use this method. It is possible to use RHUI in conjunction with the Red Hat content delivery network (CDN) to manage your Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. For information about using Red Hat CDN, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux Clients with CDN. You are responsible for connecting Uyuni Server to the Red Hat update infrastructure. All clients that get updates using this RHUI certificate need to be correctly licensed, please check with your cloud provider and the Red Hat terms of service for more information. When Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients registered with RHUI are switched off, Red Hat might declare the certificate invalid. In this case, you need to turn the client on again, or get a new RHUI certificate. In the past it was required to import the certificates and entitlement data manual into Uyuni Server. This task has been automated by using the same mechanism as for SUSE PAYG instances. For more information, see PAYG Overview. This guide covers clients registered to Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI). You must have at least one system registered to RHUI, with an authorized subscription for repository content. For information about using Red Hat content delivery network (CDN) instead, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux Clients with CDN. Satellite certificates for client systems require a Satellite server and subscription. Clients using Satellite certificates are not supported with Uyuni Server. The PAYG connection regular checks with the client to get the latest authentication data. It is important that the client stays running and is regular updated. If this does not happen, repository synchronization will fail with authentication errors at some point in time. Update any Red Hat 7 instance before connecting it. A Red Hat 9 instance needs to be configured with the crypto policy LEGACY to be able to connect it. Execute sudo update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY to configure it accordingly. Procedure: Connecting new Red Hat instance In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard PAYG, and click Add PAYG. Start with the page section PAYG connection Description. In the Description field, add the description. Move to the page section Instance SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the instance DNS or IP address to connect from Uyuni. In the SSH Port field, enter the port number or use default value 22. In the User field, enter the username as specified in the cloud. In the Password field, enter the password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the instance key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the key passphrase. Authentication keys must always be in PEM format. If you are not connecting directly to the instance, but via SSH bastion, proceed with Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data. Otherwise, continue with Procedure: Finishing Red Hat connecting. Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data Navigate to the page section Bastion SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the bastion hostname. In the SSH Port field, enter the bastion port number. In the User field, enter the bastion username. In the Password field, enter the bastion password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the bastion key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the bastion key passphrase. Complete the setup with Procedure: Finishing Red Hat connecting. Procedure: Finishing Red Hat connecting To complete adding new Red Hat connection data, click Create. Return to PAYG connection data Details page. The updated connection status is displayed on the top section named Information. Connection status is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go screen, too. If the authentication data for the instance is correct, the column Status shows Credentials successfully updated. If invalid data is entered at any point, the newly created instance is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > PAYG, with column Status displaying an error message. As soon as the authentication data is available on the server, repositories were added for all available repositories on the connected instance. The repositories can be seen in Software > Manage > Repositories A Red Hat connection will create custom repositories which are owned by organization 1 by default. If a different organization should own the autogenerated repositories, configure java.rhui_default_org_id in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. This only defines and updates the repositories. If you want to use a repository for a managed client, you need to specify a Software Channel and connect the repositories to it. Before you register Red Hat clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. In the following section, descriptions often default to the x86_64 architecture. Replace it with other architectures if appropriate. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 1. Red Hat Channels - CLI OS Version Base Channel Client Channel Tools Channel Red Hat 7 rhel7-pool-uyuni - rhel7-uyuni-client Red Hat 8 rhel8-pool-uyuni - rhel8-uyuni-client Red Hat 9 rhel9-pool-uyuni - rhel9-uyuni-client Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the spacewalk-common-channels command to add the appropriate channels. Ensure you specify the correct architecture: spacewalk-common-channels \\ -a <architecture> \\ <base_channel_name> \\ <child_channel_name_1> \\ <child_channel_name_2> \\ ... <child_channel_name_n> If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels: spacewalk-repo-sync -p <base_channel_label>-<architecture> Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing. The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. To mirror the software from RHUI, you need to create custom channels in Uyuni that are linked to autogenerated repositories. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 2. Red Hat Custom Channels OS Version Base Channel Red Hat 7 rhel7-pool-uyuni Red Hat 8 rhel8-pool-uyuni Red Hat 9 rhel9-pool-uyuni Procedure: Creating Custom Channels On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels. Click Create Channel and set the appropriate parameters for the channels. In the Parent Channel field, select the appropriate base channel. Click Create Channel. Repeat for all channels you need to create. There should be one custom channel for each custom repository. You can check that you have created all the appropriate channels and repositories, by navigating to Software Channel List All. For Red Hat 9 and Red Hat 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels. You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. When you have created all the channels, you can associate them with the repositories you created: Procedure: Associating Channels with Repositories On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and click the channel to associate. Navigate to the Repositories tab, and check the repository to associate with this channel. Click Update Repositories to associate the channel and the repository. Repeat for all channels and repositories you need to associate. OPTIONAL: Navigate to the Sync tab to set a recurring schedule for synchronization of this repository. Click Sync Now to begin synchronization immediately. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt To list available logs before tailing, run the following command: mgrctl exec -ti -- ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/ At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key.

Registering Rocky Linux clients to Uyuni is tested with the default SELinux configuration of enforcing with a targeted policy. You do not need to disable SELinux to register Rocky Linux clients to Uyuni. Before you can register Rocky Linux clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. The architectures currently supported are: x86_64 and aarch64, on version 9 additionally ppc64le and s390x. For full list of supported products and architectures, see Supported Clients and Features.

You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. You might notice some disparity in the number of packages available in the AppStream channel between upstream and the Uyuni channel. You might also see different numbers if you compare the same channel added at a different point in time. This is due to the way that Rocky Linux manages their repositories. Rocky Linux removes older version of packages when a new version is released, while Uyuni keeps all of them, regardless of age. If you are using modular channels with Rocky Linux 8, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client. If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the spacecmd package will fail.

Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt To list available logs before tailing, run the following command: mgrctl exec -ti -- ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/ At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. SLE Micro clients require a reboot after registering. Following the bootstrapping process, automatic booting is disabled on SLE Micro clients. This change was implemented due to intermittent automatic reboots, which could occurr before Salt could relay the results of applying the bootstrap Salt state. Although a reboot is automatically scheduled after registration is completed, it is respecting the default reboot manager maintenance window. This window may be several hours after the client is registered. It is advisable to manually reboot the client after the registration script finishes, to speed up the registration and to see the system appear in the system list. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt on the container host: mgrctl exec -ti mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration. When using a bootstrap script with SLE Micro systems, ensure that the certificate section of the script has this content: ORG_CA_CERT=RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT ORG_CA_CERT_IS_RPM_YN=0 Either edit the bootstrap script directly and add the settings, or create the bootstrap script with these parameters: mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-bootstrap --script=bootstrap-sle-micro.sh \\ --ssl-cert=/srv/www/htdocs/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT SLE Micro is a transactional system. Transactional updates in general support several reboot methods. It is recommended to use systemd for rebooting in systems managed by Uyuni. Using other methods can lead to undesired behavior. When bootstrapping a transactional system on Uyuni, systemd will be configured as the reboot method (REBOOT_METHOD), if the system is in its default configuration. Such a configuration allows Uyuni to control the reboot action, and rebooting can be performed immediately or scheduled with Uyuni as wanted. By default, the reboot method during client installation is set to auto. With the auto boot method, rebootmgrd will be used to reboot the system according to the configured policies if the service is running. Policies can be to reboot instantly or during a maintenance window. For more information, see the rebootmgrd(8) man page. Otherwise if rebootmgrd is not running, Uyuni will call systemctl reboot. Using any method different from systemd may cause undesired behavior.","title":"Registering SLE Micro Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-slemicro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-slemicro.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You need all the new channels fully synchronized before bootstrapping any Ubuntu client. Canonical provides Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) packages for Ubuntu Pro users and customers. These packages offer longer maintenance (10 to 12 years) for several operating system components and selected applications. These repositories can also be synchronized within Uyuni if you extract the required GPG keys and your personal Bearer Token from a system registered to Ubuntu Pro. Register an Ubuntu host with Ubuntu Pro. You will find your personal registration token in the Ubuntu Pro Dashbaord. An Ubuntu One acconut is required for this. sudo apt-get install ubuntu-advantage-tools sudo pro attach <perosnal_token> After registration, you will find the Bearer Token in the file /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage: machine esm.ubuntu.com/apps/ubuntu/ login bearer password <token> # ubuntu-pro-client machine esm.ubuntu.com/infra/ubuntu/ login bearer password <token> # ubuntu-pro-client One dedicated bearer token is used per repository. Configure the following repositories within Uyuni: Use the following URLs for creating the repositories: Table 3. Ubuntu ESM repositories URL Description https://bearer:<token>@esm.ubuntu.com/infra/ubuntu/dists/<release>-infra-updates/main/binary-<arch>/ Operating system functional updates https://bearer:<token>@esm.ubuntu.com/infra/ubuntu/dists/<release>-infra-security/main/binary-<arch>/ Operating system security updates https://bearer:<token>@esm.ubuntu.com/apps/ubuntu/dists/<release>-apps-updates/main/binary-<arch>/ Application functional updates https://bearer:<token>@esm.ubuntu.com/apps/ubuntu/dists/<release>-apps-security/main/binary-<arch>/ Application security updates Replace <token> with your personal Bearer Token. Also, arch and release must be replaced with one of the following values: Table 4. Ubuntu ESM architectures and releases Architectures Releases amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x bionic, focal, jammy, noble, trusty, xenial In order for Uyuni to synchronize the repositories, the corresponding GPG keys (ubuntu-advantage-esm-infra-trusty.gpg, ubuntu-advantage-esm-apps.gpg) must be imported. These are located on a system registered with Ubuntu Pro under /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d. Copy these files to the Uyuni system and import them as follows: mgradm gpg add /path/to/gpg.key Create the appropriate child channels below already synchronized Ubuntu parent channels. After that, repositories can be synchronized. The procedure shown here can be used to circumvent the subscription limitations - however, this constitutes a breach of the Terms of Service and may have legal consequences. There must always be sufficient subscriptions for the number of systems used. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt To list available logs before tailing, run the following command: mgrctl exec -ti -- ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/ At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Ubuntu channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. The root user on Ubuntu is disabled by default for SSH access. To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the sudoers file. This issue happens with self-installed versions of Ubuntu. If the default user has been granted administrative privileges during installation time, a password is required to perform privilege escalation using sudo. With cloud instances this does not happen because cloud-init automatically creates a file under /etc/sudoers.d and grants privilege escalation through sudo without the need for a password. Procedure: Granting Root User Access On the client, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace <user> with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. To bootstrap an Ubuntu client via SSH you must add the install-created user to the sudo group. Then run the bootstrap script from the client. Procedure: Adding Install-created User to sudo Group and Bootstrapping via SSH On the client, as root, run from the command line (replace <username> with the name of the install-created user): sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> Bootstrap the client system from its command line (replace <SERVER_FQDN> with the fully qualified domain name of the Uyuni Server): sudo su - curl -Sks https://<SERVER_FQDN>/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-script.sh | /bin/bash Ubuntu can only be bootstrapped using the corresponding Ubuntu bootstrap script run from the client system’s command line after issuing sudo su - as above. It cannot be bootstrapped via the Uyuni Web UI due to the fact that the root user is disabled on Ubuntu by default, and that the Web UI does not permit for privilege escalation of the Ubuntu install-created user. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt on the container host: mgrctl exec -ti mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Ubuntu Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-ubuntu","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-ubuntu.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

As soon as the key is accepted in Salt, the onboarding process in Uyuni starts. The onboarding process will look for existing systems in the Uyuni database by searching for the minion_id and the machine-id. Depending on the outcome, the following scenarios are possible: If nothing is found, the new system gets created. In case an entry with the minion_id or the machine-id is found, that system will be migrated to match the new system.

Which Salt contact method you use depends on the type of client and your network architecture: Default is recommended unless there are specific user needs. By default, the Salt Bundle implementation will be deployed. For more information, see Default Contact Method. SSH Push is useful only if network restrictions make it impossible for clients to establish contact to the server. It is supported with the Salt Bundle only. This contact method has serious limitations. For more information, see SSH Push Contact Method. SSH Push (with tunnel) is the same as SSH Push, but with using a secured communication tunnel. For more information, see SSH Push (With Tunnel) Contact Method. Implementation of Salt communication software options: Salt Bundle (venv-salt-minion) is a single binary package containing Salt Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries. Thus the Salt contact method is independent from software installed on the client. Using the Salt Bundle is the default. It is the only supported implementation for the SSH Push or SSH Push (with tunnel) contact method. For more information, see Salt Bundle. Salt Minion (salt-minion) is Salt software installed on the client system. The SSH Push or SSH Push (with tunnel) contact method is not supported with this Salt Minion. (salt-minion) is still a supported implementation for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 and derivatives (like SLE Micro). It is not the default, and there are a number of reasons venv-salt-minion is preferred for Uyuni clients. The so-called traditional contact protocol is no longer supported with Uyuni 5.0 and later. Before upgrading from Uyuni 4 to 5, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt or replaced with Salt proxies. For more information about migrating traditional Uyuni 4 clients to Salt clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html","title":"Client Contact Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-intro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-intro.html","titles":[]},"96":{"id":96,"text":"The Salt Bundle is a single binary package containing Salt Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries. The Salt Bundle is shipped with Python 3 and all the requirements for Salt to run. Thus Salt Bundle does not use the Python version install on the client as system software. The Salt Bundle can be installed on clients that do not meet the requirements for a given Salt version. It is also possible to use the Salt Bundle on systems that run a Salt Minion connected to a Salt Master other than the Uyuni Salt Master. The registration method with the Salt Bundle is the recommended registration method. This section explains the advantages and limitations of the current implementation. The Salt Bundle is provided as the venv-salt-minion package that consists of Salt, Python 3, and the Python modules Salt depends on. Bootstrapping with Web UI is using Salt Bundle as well, so bootstrapping with Web UI is not Python dependant. Using the Salt Bundle, it is no longer needed that the client provides any Python interpreter or modules. If you bootstrap new clients, registration with the Salt Bundle is the default method. You can switch existing clients to the Salt Bundle method. If you switch, the salt-minion package and its dependencies will stay installed. The Salt Bundle can be used with the Salt Minion managed by the Salt Master other than Uyuni Server at the same time. If the Salt Bundle is installed on a client Uyuni Server will manage the configuration files of the Salt Bundle, the configuration files of salt-minion will not be managed in this case. For more information, see Salt Bundle configuration. To bootstrap a client with the Salt Minion managed by the Salt Master other than Uyuni Server it is recommended to use mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle when generating the bootstrap script, or to set FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION to 1 in the bootstrap script. For bootstrapping with Web UI mgr_force_venv_salt_minion set to true pillar can be specified globally. For more information, see Salt States and Pillars. The Salt state util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion is available to switch from salt-minion to venv-salt-minion. It is recommended to switch to venv-salt-minion in two steps to avoid trouble with shifting processes: Procedure: SwitchingWwith util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion State to venv-salt-minion Apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion with no pillar specified first. This will result in the switch to venv-salt-minion with copying configuration files etc. It will not clean up the original salt-minion configurations and its packages. salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion Apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion with mgr_purge_non_venv_salt set to True to remove salt-minion and with mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files set to True to remove all the files related to salt-minion. This second step ensures the first step was processed, and then removes the old configuration files and the now obsolete salt-minion package. salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' In case of running the second step only and the first step, state apply process could fail as it requires stopping the salt-minion which is used to execute the command on the client side. It is also possible to avoid installing the Salt Bundle and keep using salt-minion instead. In this case, specify one of these options: Execute mgr-bootstrap with --no-bundle option. Set AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION to 1 in the generated bootstrap script. For bootstrap state set the mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillar to True in /srv/pillar/salt_bundle_config.sls. The Salt Bundle is also used when performing SSH Push actions to clients. A shell script deploys the Salt Bundle onto the target system without installing venv-salt-minion before any Salt command is executed. Because the Salt Bundle contains the whole Salt code base, no salt-thin is deployed. SSH Push (including bootstrapping using the Web UI) uses the Python 3 interpreter within the bundle. The target system does not need to have any other Python interpreter installed. The Python 3 deployed with the Bundle is used to handle SSH Push session on the client, so SSH Push (including bootstrapping with Web UI) is not dependant on Python installed on the system. Using salt-thin can be enabled as a fallback method, but it requires Python 3 to be installed on the client. This method is not recommended nor supported and exists for development purposes only. Set web.ssh_use_salt_thin to true in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. The bootstrap repository must be created before bootstrapping the client with Web UI. SSH Push is using the Salt Bundle taken from the bootstrap repository based on the detected target operating system. For more information, see client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository. SSH Push is using /var/tmp to deploy Salt Bundle to and execute Salt commands on the client with the bundled Python. Therefore you must not mount /var/tmp with the noexec option. It is not possible to bootstrap the clients, which have /var/tmp mounted with noexec option, with the Web UI because the bootstrap process is using SSH Push to reach a client. The Salt Bundle includes pip to make it possible to extend the functionality of the bundled Salt Minion with extra Python packages. By default, salt <minion_id> pip.install <package-name> installs the Python package specified by <package_name> into /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local. If needed, the path /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local can be overridden by setting the VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable for the venv-salt-minion.service. It is recommended to use a systemd drop-in configuration file for the service. It could be done with the configuration file /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf: [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip The Python packages installed through pip are not changing on updating the Salt Bundle. To ensure that such packages are available and functional after an update, it is recommended to install them with a Salt state that is applied after Salt Bundle updates.","title":"Salt Bundle","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the Uyuni Server. In other words: SSH Push (with tunnel) also creates a reverse tunnel from the client to the Uyuni Server, not only from the server to the client. The server uses SSH to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with SSH Push. The tunnel is used to provide the access to the server through the encrypted tunnel. The repositories assigned to the SSH Push client (with tunnel) are provided through this tunnel only, thus it is not possible to use package manager tools directly from the client system because the repositories are available only while the tunnel is up. In other words, access is only possible if the session is initiated by the server. All package managing operations on the client can be performed from the server side only. Use mgrctl term before running steps inside the server container. For tunneling connections via SSH, a port number is required for tunneling via HTTPS. The port number used by default is 1233. To overwrite it, inside the container, you can add a custom port numbers greater than 1024 to /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: ssh_push_port_https = high_port After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service. To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart the Uyuni Server as root. Outside of the container, from the container host, enter: mgradm restart For security reasons, you might want to use sudo with SSH, to access the system as an unprivileged user instead of as root. Procedure: Configuring Unprivileged SSH Access On each client system, create an appropriate unprivileged user. On each client system, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace <user> with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. Inside the Uyuni Server container, edit the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file, and add or amend this line to include the unprivileged username: ssh_push_sudo_user = <user> After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service.

Before you begin, you need to ensure that you have specified which ports to use for SSH tunneling. If you have registered clients before changing the port numbers, they need to be registered again with a re-activation key. For more information about bootstrapping, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. For more information about bootstrapping, see client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc#activation-keys-reactivation.

In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network where the Uyuni Server is located. SSH Push opens a tunnel only from Uyuni to the client, but the reverse channel goes directly. Such a scenario might not work everywhere. Therefore also SSH Push (with tunnel) is available as contact method. That also opens a reverse tunnel and thus you can communicate through all firewalls which otherwise might block the connection from client to server. SSH Push is also to use if installing a daemon agent on clients is not possible. The SSH Push method has serious limitations. It does not scale well, and consumes more Server resources and network bandwidth than the plain Salt method (default). The Push SSH method is not at all supported with large setups (1000 clients and more). The server uses the SSH Push to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with SSH Push. This image demonstrates the SSH Push process path. All items left of the Taskomatic block represent processes running on the Uyuni client. To use SSH Push, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the salt-api daemon running on the Uyuni Server. Additionally, the required Python version will be deployed with the Salt Bundle on the client system. Before beginning with the following registering procedure, define an activation key with the SSH Push contact method configured. This method expects that there is a direct connection with HTTPS to the Server. You need to use the Web UI or API to register these clients with the Uyuni Server. See the following procedure or example. Procedure: Registering Clients With SSH Push In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping and complete the appropriate fields. Select an activation key with the SSH Push contact method configured. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Check the Manage system completely via SSH checkbox. Click Bootstrap to begin registration. Confirm that the system has been registered correctly by navigating to Systems Overview. Example: API Access to Push via SSH You can use the API to manage which contact method to use. This example Python code sets the contact method to ssh-push. Valid values are: default (pull) ssh-push ssh-push-tunnel client = xmlrpclib.Server(MLM_HOST + \"/rpc/api\", verbose=0) key = client.auth.login(MLM_LOGIN, MLM_PASSWORD) client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'}) When you are configuring SSH Push, you can modify parameters that are used when a system is registered, including the host, activation key, and password. The password is used only for bootstrapping, it is not saved anywhere. All future SSH sessions are authorized via a key/certificate pair. These parameters are configured in Systems Bootstrapping. You can also configure persistent parameters that are used system-wide, including the sudo user to access the system as an unprivileged user instead of as root. Use mgrctl term before running steps inside the server container. Procedure: Configuring Unprivileged SSH Access Ensure you have the latest spacewalk-taskomatic and spacewalk-certs-tools packages installed on the Uyuni Server. On each client system, create an appropriate unprivileged user. On each client system, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file.

To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart the Uyuni Server as root. Outside of the container, from the container host, enter: mgradm restart The SSH Push feature uses taskomatic to execute scheduled actions using salt-ssh. The taskomatic job periodically checks for scheduled actions and executes them. The SSH Push feature executes a complete salt-ssh call based on the scheduled action. By default, twenty Salt SSH actions can be executed at a time. You can increase the number of actions that can be executed in parallel, by adding these lines to your configuration file, and adjusting the value of parallel_threads upwards. We recommend you keep the number of parallel actions low, to avoid problems: taskomatic.sshminion_action_executor.parallel_threads = <number> org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = <value of parallel_threads + 20> This adjusts the number of actions that can run in parallel on any one client and the total number of worker threads used by taskomatic. If actions needs to be run on multiple clients, actions are always executed sequentially on each client. If the clients are connected through a proxy, you need to adjust the MaxSessions settings on the proxy. In this case, set the number of parallel connections to be three times the total number of clients. There are some features that are not yet supported on SSH Push. These features do not work on Salt SSH clients: OpenSCAP auditing Beacons, resulting in: Installing a package on a system using zypper does not invoke the package refresh. Virtual Host functions (for example, a host to guests) does not work if the virtual host system is Salt SSH-based.

Only trusted software can be installed on clients. In most cases, you do not need to adjust the GPG settings to be able to install software on your clients. RPM packages can be signed directly, while Debian based systems sign only the metadata and use a chain of checksums to secure the packages. Most RPM based systems use signed metadata in addition to signed packages. Operating systems either trust their own GPG keys directly or at least ship them installed with the minimal system. But third party packages signed by a different GPG key need manual handling. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Because Debian based systems sign only metadata, there is no need to specify extra keys for single channels. If a user configures an own GPG key to sign the metadata as described in \"Use Your Own GPG Key\" in Repository Metadata the deployment and trust of that key is executed automatically. Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. By providing some pillar data and providing the GPG key files in the Salt filesystem, they are automatically deployed to the client. These keys are deployed into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ on RPM based operating systems and to /usr/share/keyrings/ on Debian systems: Define the pillar key [literalcustom_gpgkeys for the client you want to deploy the key to and list the names of the key file. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg Additionally in the Salt filesystem create a directory named gpg and store there the GPG key files with the name specified in the custom_gpgkeys pillar data. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg.

Orphaned packages are packages synchronized by Uyuni that are not associated with a software channel. Therefore, orphaned packages are usually not available to Uyuni clients and users cannot install such packages without additional effort. A package can become orphaned as a result of one of the following events: A synchronized repository removes a package. By default, Uyuni unlinks such a package from the channel, but does not remove the package. A repository supersedes a package with a newer version and thus removes the previous version. The reposync process got interrupted (for example, because of an out of space exception) and thus downloaded packages were not associated with a channel. Users manually uploaded packages, but did not associate them with any channel. Orphaned packages cost space in user environment and cannot be easily distributed to clients because they are not associated with a channel. Orphaned package can make sense with specific workflows like bootstrapping or customer-specific procedures. You can view orphaned packages in the Web UI by clicking Software Manage Packages view Packages in no channel. Uyuni periodically runs a taskomatic job that searches for orphaned packages and modifies the package organization ID to 1. This means that you can delete orphaned packages only after the taskomatic job execution. If you encounter an orphaned package that you cannot delete, wait 24 hours and try the deletion again. Delete orphaned packages: with command line tools targeting individual packages.

This feature uses either the IPMI or Redfish protocol and is managed using a Cobbler profile. The selected client must have a power management controller supporting one of these protocols. For Redfish, ensure you can establish a valid SSL connection between the client and the Uyuni Server. You must have trusted the certificate authority used to sign the SSL Server Certificate of the Redfish management controller. The CA certificate must be in .pem format, and stored on the Uyuni Server at /etc/pki/trust/anchors/. When you have saved the certificate, run update-ca-certificate.

To register clients using a bootstrap script, we recommend you create a template bootstrap script to begin, which can then be copied and modified. The bootstrap script you create is executed on the client when it is registered, and ensures all the necessary packages are deployed to the client. Some parameters in the bootstrap script ensure the client system can be assigned to its base channel, using activation key and GPG key. It is important that you check the repository information carefully, to ensure it matches the base channel repository. If the repository information does not match exactly, the bootstrap script cannot download the correct packages. Additional considerations: All clients need a bootstrap repository. It is automatically created and regenerated on the Uyuni Server when products are synchronized. A bootstrap repository includes packages for installing Salt on clients, and for registering clients. For more information about creating a bootstrap repository, see Bootstrap Repository. openSUSE Leap 15 and SLE 15 use Python 3 by default. Bootstrap scripts based on Python 2 must be re-created for openSUSE Leap 15 and SLE 15 systems. If you register openSUSE Leap 15 or SLE 15 systems using Python 2, the bootstrap script fails. GPG Keys and Uyuni Client Tools The GPG key used by Uyuni Client Tools is not trusted by default. When you create your bootstrap script, add a path to the file containing the public key fingerprint with the ORG_GPG_KEY parameter. The mgr-bootstrap command generates custom bootstrap scripts. A bootstrap script is used by Uyuni client systems for simplifying their initial registration and configuration. The arguments --activation-keys and --script, are the only mandatory arguments. On the Uyuni Server, as root at the command line execute it with the mandatory arguments. Replace <ACTIVATION_KEY and <EDITED_NAME> with your values: mgr-bootstrap --activation-keys=<ACTIVATION_KEY> --script=bootstrap-<EDITED_NAME>.sh The mgr-bootstrap command offers several other options, including the ability to set a specific hostname, set specific GPG keys, and set the registration method (salt-minion or salt-bundle). If users wish to create a bootstrap script to register against the Proxy, they can do so using the following command from the Server container: mgr-boostrap --hostname $proxyfqdn For more information, see the mgr-bootstrap man page, or run mgr-bootstrap --help. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create an editable bootstrap script. Procedure: Creating a Bootstrap Script In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Manager Configuration Bootstrap Script. The required fields are pre-populated with values derived from previous installation steps. For details on each setting, see Bootstrap Script. Click Update to create the script. The bootstrap script is generated and stored on the server in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap directory. Alternatively, you can access the bootstrap script over HTTPS. Replace <example.com> with the host name of your Uyuni Server: https://<example.com>/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh Do not disable SSL in your bootstrap script. Ensure that Enable SSL is checked in the Web UI, or that the setting USING_SSL=1 exists in the bootstrap script. If you disable SSL, the registration process requires custom SSL certificates. For more information about custom certificates, see SSL Certificates. You can copy and modify the template bootstrap script you created to customize it. A minimal requirement when modifying a bootstrap script for use with Uyuni is the inclusion of an activation key. Most packages are signed with GPG, so you also need to have trusted GPG keys on your system to install them. In this procedure, you need to know the exact name of your activation keys. Navigate to Home Overview and, in the Tasks box, click Manage Activation Keys. All keys created for channels are listed on this page. You must enter the full name of the key you wish to use in the bootstrap script exactly as presented in the key field. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Procedure: Modifying a Bootstrap Script On your Uyuni Server, as root at the command line change to the bootstrap directory with: cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ Create and rename two copies of the template bootstrap script for use with each of your clients. cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles12.sh cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles15.sh Open bootstrap-sles15.sh for modification. Scroll down until you can see the text shown below. If exit 1 exists in the file, comment it out by typing a hash or pound sign (#) at the beginning of the line. This activates the script. Enter the name of the key for this script in the ACTIVATION_KEYS= field: echo \"Enable this script: comment (with #'s) this block (or, at least just\" echo \"the exit below)\" echo #exit 1 # can be edited, but probably correct (unless created during initial install): # NOTE: ACTIVATION_KEYS *must* be used to bootstrap a client machine. ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-sles15 ORG_GPG_KEY= Instead of editing the script manually, user can pass the following environment variables at runtime: ACTIVATION_KEYS: Activation keys to use for registration ORG_GPG_KEY: Path or identifier of the GPG key REACTIVATION_KEY: Reactivation key for previously registered systems MGR_SERVER_HOSTNAME: Hostname of the Server or Proxy to register the client against Using environment variables allows dynamic input at runtime and makes it easier to reuse the same bootstrap script across different systems or environments. When you have finished, save the file, and repeat this procedure for the second bootstrap script. By default, bootstrap script will try to install venv-salt-minion if it is available in the bootstrap repository and salt-minion if there is no Salt bundle in the bootstrap repository. It is possible to avoid installing Salt bundle and keep using salt-minion if you need it for some reason. For more information, see Salt Bundle. When you have finished creating your script, you can use it to register clients. Procedure: Running the Bootstrap Script On the Uyuni Server, log in as root. At the command prompt, and change to the bootstrap directory: cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ Run this command to execute the bootstrap script on the client; replace EXAMPLE.COM with the host name of your client: cat bootstrap-sles15.sh | ssh root@EXAMPLE.COM /bin/bash Alternatively, on the client, run this command: ACTIVATION_KEYS=\"17-someactivationkey\" \\ MGR_SERVER_HOSTNAME=\"proxy.example.com\" \\ ORG_GPG_KEY=\"mykey\" \\ REACTIVATION_KEY=my-reactivation-key \\ curl -Sks https://server_hostname/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash If you do not need to override any values, you can omit the environment variables entirely: curl -Sks https://server_hostname/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash To avoid problems, make sure the bootstrap script is executed using bash. This script downloads the required dependencies located in the repositories directory you created earlier. When the script has finished running, you can check that the client is registered correctly. Open the Uyuni Web UI and navigate to Systems Overview to ensure the new client is listed. If the client is not listed, in the Uyuni Web UI navigate to Salt Keys and check whether the client key is accepted. When new packages or updates are installed on the client using Uyuni, any end user license agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted. To review a package EULA, open the package detail page in the Web UI.","title":"Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-bootstrap","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

SSH private keys are stored only for the duration of the bootstrapping process. They are deleted from the Uyuni Server as soon as bootstrapping is complete. When new packages or updates are installed on the client using Uyuni, any end user license agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted. To review a package EULA, open the package details page in the Web UI. Having repositories assigned directly to clients not served by Uyuni is not a common use case. It can cause trouble. Therfore bootstrapping via Salt disables all local repositories at the beginning of the bootstrap process. Later, during every use of the channel state, for example when executing a Highstate or a package installation, all locally assigned repositories are disabled again. All software packages which are used on the clients should come from channels served by Uyuni. For more information about creating a custom channel, see Custom Channels at Custom Channels.","title":"Register Clients With the Web UI","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-webui","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-webui.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

When you have access to a software repository, you can install any of the software that the repository provides. You must have at least one repository associated with your software channels in Uyuni to assign clients to the channel and install and update packages on the client. Most default channels in Uyuni are already associated with the correct repositories. If you are creating custom channels, you need to associate a repository that you have access to, or that you have created yourself. For more information about custom repositories and channels, see Custom Channels. You can configure local repositories on clients, to provide packages that are not supplied by Uyuni channels. In most cases, client systems do not require local repositories. Local repositories can lead to problems knowing which packages are available on the client. This can lead to installing unexpected packages. Local repositories are disabled during onboarding. Local repositories will be disabled each time a channel state is executed. For example, when applying the highstate or performing a package action. If local repositories should stay enabled after onboarding, the following pillar must be set for the affected client: Edit the /srv/pillar/top.sls file: base: 'minionid': - localrepos Edit the /srv/pillar/localrepos.sls file: mgr_disable_local_repos: False After a client has completed onboarding, you can add local repositories to these locations: Table 1.

Groups can be used to perform bulk actions on clients such as applying updates, configuration channels, salt states, or formulas. You can organize clients into groups in any way that works for your environment. For example, you could organize clients on which operating system is installed, which physical location they are in, or the type of workload they are handling. Clients can be in any number of groups, so you can define your groups in different ways. When you have clients organized into groups, you can perform updates on all clients in one or more groups, or on intersections between groups. For example, you can define one group for all clients with web server software, and another group for all SLES clients. You can then perform updates on all clients with web server software, or use the intersection between the groups, and update all SLES clients with web server software. You need to create some groups before you can use them to organize your clients. Procedure: Creating a New System Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups. Click Create Group. Give your new group a name and a description. Click Create Group to save your group. Repeat for each group you require. You can add individual clients to your groups, or add multiple clients at the same time. Procedure: Adding A Single Client to a Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and click the name of the client to add. Navigate to the Groups Join tab. Check the group to join and click Join Selected Groups. Procedure: Adding Multiple Clients to a Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click the name of the group to add clients to. Navigate to the Target systems tab. Check the clients to add and click Add Systems. Procedure: Adding Multiple Clients to a Group with SSM In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and check each client to add, this adds the clients to the system set manager. Navigate to Systems System Set Manager, and go to the Groups tab. Locate the group to join and check Add. Click Alter Membership. Click Confirm to join the clients to the selected group. For more information about the system set manager, see System Set Manager. You can see which clients are in a group by navigating to Systems System Groups, clicking the name of the group, and navigating to the Systems tab. When you have your clients arranged into groups, you can use your groups to manage updates. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups. The list shows an icon if there are updates available for any of the clients in the group. The list shows a question mark icon if checking the update status is disabled for any of the clients in the group. Click the icon to see more information about the updates available and to apply them to the clients. You can also work with more than one group at a time. Select the groups you want to work with, and click Work with union to select every client in every selected group. Alternatively, you can work on intersections of groups. Select two or more groups, and click Work with intersection to select only those clients that exist in all the selected groups. For example, you might have one group for all clients with web server software, and another group for all SLES clients. The intersection of these groups would be all SLES clients with web server software.","title":"System Groups","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"system-groups","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/system-groups.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For example, a system lock prevents a client from being updated or restarted. This is useful for clients running production software, or to prevent accidental changes. You can disable the system lock when you are ready to perform actions. When a client is locked, or put into blackout mode, no actions can be scheduled, execution commands are disabled, and a yellow banner is displayed on the System Details page. In this mode, actions can be scheduled for the locked client using the Web UI or the API, but the actions fail. The locking mechanism is not available for Salt SSH clients. Procedure: System Locking a Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the System Details page for the client you want to lock. Navigate to the Formulas tab, check the system lock formula, and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas System Lock tab, check Lock system, and click Save. On this page, you can also enable specific Salt modules while the client is locked. When you have made your changes, you might need to apply the highstate. In this case, a banner in the Web UI notifies you. The client remains locked until you remove the system lock formula. For more information about blackout mode in Salt, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/blackout. Package locking can be used on several clients, but different feature sets are available. You must differentiate between SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE (zypp-based) versus Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Debian clients. Package locks are used to prevent unauthorized installation or upgrades to software packages. When a package has been locked, it shows a padlock icon, indicating that it cannot be installed. Any attempt to install a locked package is reported as an error in the event log. Locked packages cannot be installed, upgraded, or removed, neither through the Uyuni Web UI, nor directly on the client machine using a package manager. Locked packages also indirectly lock any dependent packages. Procedure: Using Package Locks Navigate to the Software Packages Lock tab on the managed system to see a list of all available packages. Select the packages to lock, and click Request Lock. Pick date and time for the lock to activate. By default, the lock is activated as soon as possible. Note that the lock might not activate immediately. To remove a package lock, select the packages to unlock and click Request Unlock. Pick date and time as with activating the lock. Some Red Hat Enterprise Linux- and Debian-like systems have package locking available on clients. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux- and Debian-like systems, package locks are only used to prevent unauthorized upgrades or removals to software packages. When a package has been locked, it shows a padlock icon, indicating that it cannot be changed. Any attempt to change a locked package is reported as an error in the event log. Locked packages cannot be upgraded or removed, neither through the Uyuni Web UI, nor directly on the client machine using a package manager. Locked packages also indirectly lock any dependent packages. Procedure: Using Package Locks On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 systems, install yum-plugin-versionlock, and on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 systems, install python3-dnf-plugin-versionlock as root. On Debian systems, the apt tool has the locking feature included. Navigate to the Software Packages Lock tab on the managed system to see a list of all available packages.

To begin, you need to set up a VHM on your Uyuni Server, and inventory the available VM hosts. Taskomatic can then begin data collection using the VMs API. The Virtual Host Manager (VHM) runs on the Uyuni Server. To run a VHM, your Uyuni Server needs to have port 443 open, to access the VMware API. VMware hosts use access roles and permissions to control access to hosts and guests. Ensure that any VMware objects or resources that you want to be inventoried by the VHM have at least read-only permissions. If you want to exclude any objects or resources, mark them with no-access. When you are adding new hosts to Uyuni, you need to consider if the roles and permissions that have been assigned to users and objects need to be inventoried by Uyuni. For more on users, roles, and permissions, see the VMware vSphere documentation: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html Procedure: Creating a VMware VHM In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Virtual Host Managers. Click Create and select VMware-based. In the Add a VMware-based Virtual Host Manager section, use these parameters: In the Label field, type a custom name for your VHM. In the Hostname field, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or host IP address. In the Port field, type the ESXi API port to use (for example, 443). In the Username field, type the username associated with the VM host. In the Password field, type the password associated with the VM host user. Click Create to save your changes and create the VHM. On the Virtual Host Managers page select the new VHM. On the Properties page, click Refresh Data to inventory the new VHM. To see which objects and resources have been inventoried, navigate to Systems System List Virtual Systems. Connecting to the ESXi server from a browser using HTTPS can sometimes log an invalid certificate error. If this occurs, refreshing the data from the virtual hosts server fails. To correct the problem, extract the certificate from the ESXi server, and copy it to /etc/pki/trust/anchors. Re-trust the certificate by running the update-ca-certificates command on the command line, and restart the spacewalk services. After your VHM has been created and configured, Taskomatic runs data collection automatically. If you want to manually perform data collection, navigate to Systems Virtual Host Managers, select the appropriate VHM, and click Refresh Data. Uyuni ships with a tool called virtual-host-gatherer that can connect to VHMs using their API, and request information about virtual hosts. virtual-host-gatherer maintains the concept of optional modules, where each module enables a specific VHM. This tool is automatically invoked nightly by Taskomatic. Log files for the virtual-host-gatherer tool are located at /var/log/rhn/gatherer.log. If you see SSL errors while configuring your VMware installation, you need to download the CA certificate file from VMware, and trust it on Uyuni. Procedure: Trusting VMware CA Certificates Download the CA Certificate from your VMware installation. You can do this by logging in to your vCenter Web UI, and clicking Download trusted root CA certificates. If the downloaded CA certificates file is in .zip format, extract the archive. The certificate files have a number as an extension. For example, certificate.0. Copy the certificate files to your Uyuni Server, and save them to the /etc/pki/trust/anchors/ directory. Change the filename suffix on the copied certificate to either .crt or .pem.

To begin, you need to set up a virtual host on your Uyuni Server. You can then set up autoinstallation using AutoYaST or Kickstart for additional virtual hosts and for virtual guests. This section also includes information about administering virtual guests after they have been installed. The way that you set up Xen or KVM on a VM host depends on operating system you want to use on its associated guests: For SUSE operating systems, see the SLES Virtualization Guide available from https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/book-virtualization.html. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems, refer to the Red Hat documentation for your version. The Virtualization Host formula will help you with initializing the host. For more information, see Initialize Virtualization Host. Uyuni uses libvirt to install and manage guests. You must have the libvirt-daemon package installed on your host. In most cases, the default settings are sufficient and you do not need to adjust them. However, if you want to access the VNC console on your guests as a non-root user, you need to perform some configuration changes. For more information about how to set up the VNC console, see the documentation for your operating system. You need a bootstrap script on the Uyuni Server. The bootstrap script must include the activation key for your host. We also recommend that you include your GPG key for additional security. For more on creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. When the bootstrap script is ready, use it to register the host with the Uyuni Server. For more information about client registration, see Client Registration. With the Virtualization Host formula, initialize the host: Procedure: Initializing Virtualization Host In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the System Details page for the host, and click the Formulas tab. Select the Virtualization Host formula, and click Save. Click the Virtualization Host subtab. Check the settings, and click Save Formula. Apply the Highstate for the changes to take effect. Restart the salt-minion service to activate the new configuration: systemctl restart salt-minion You can use AutoYaST or Kickstart to automatically install and register Xen and KVM guests. For SUSE Linux Enterprise or openSUSE clients) use AutoYaST and for Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients use Kickstart. You need an activation key for the VM host you want to register the guests to, and for each guest. For more information about creating activation keys, see Activation Keys. If you want to automatically register the guests with Uyuni after installation, you need to create a bootstrap script. For more information about creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. You need to create an autoinstallable distribution on the VM host to be able to autoinstall clients from Uyuni. The distribution can be made available from a mounted local or remote directory, or on a loop-mounted ISO image. The configuration of the autoinstallable distribution differs depending on whether you are using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE operating system on your guests. The packages for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation are fetched from the associated base channel. Packages for installing SUSE systems are fetched from the autoinstallable distribution. Therefore, for SUSE systems, the autoinstallable distribution must be a complete installation source. Table 1. Paths for Autoinstallable Distributions Operating System Type Kernel Location initrd Location Red Hat Enterprise Linux images/pxeboot/vmlinuz images/pxeboot/initrd.img SUSE boot/<arch>/loader/initrd boot/<arch>/loader/linux In all cases, ensure that the base channel matches the autoinstallable distribution. Before you begin, ensure you have a installation media available to your VM Host. It can be on a remote resource, a local directory, or a loop-mounted ISO image. Additionally, ensure that all files and directories are world-readable. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallable Distribution In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions and click Create Distribution. In the Create Autoinstallable Distribution section, use these parameters: In the Distribution Label section, type a unique name for the distribution. Use only letters, numbers, hyphens (-), periods (.), and underscores (_), and ensure the name is longer than four characters. In the Tree Path field, type an absolute path to the installation source. In the Base Channel field, select the channel that matches the installation source. This channel is used as the package source for non-SUSE installations. In the Installer Generation field, select the operating system version that matches the installation source. In the Kernel Options field, type any options to be passed to the kernel when booting for the installation. The install= parameter and the self_update=0 parameter are added by default. In the Post Kernel Options section, type any options to be passed to the kernel when booting the installed system for the first time. Click Create Autoinstallable Distribution to save. When you have created an autoinstallable distribution, you can edit it by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions and selecting the distribution you want to edit. Autoinstallation profiles contain all the installation and configuration data needed to install a system. They can also contain scripts to be executed after the installation is complete. Kickstart profiles can be created using the Uyuni Web UI, by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles, clicking Create New Kickstart File, and following the prompts. You can also create AutoYaST or Kickstart autoinstallation profiles by hand. SUSE provides templates of AutoYaST installation files that you can use as a starting point for your own custom files. You will find them at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. If you are using AutoYaST to install SLES, you also need to include this snippet: <products config:type=\"list\"> <listentry>SLES</listentry> </products> For more on AutoYaST, see client-configuration:autoinst-profiles.adoc#autoyast. For more on Kickstart, see client-configuration:autoinst-profiles.adoc#kickstart, or refer to the Red Hat documentation for your installation. Procedure: Uploading an Autoinstallation Profile In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and click Upload Kickstart/AutoYaST File. In the Create Autoinstallation Profile section, use these parameters: In the Label field, type a unique name for the profile. Use only letters, numbers, hyphens (-), periods (.), and underscores (_), and ensure the name is longer than six characters. In the Autoinstall Tree field, select the autoinstallable distribution you created earlier. In the Virtualization Type field, select the relevant Guest type (for example, KVM Virtualized Guest. Do not choose Xen Virtualized Host here. OPTIONAL: If you want to manually create your autoinstallation profile, you can type it directly into the File Contents field. If you have a file already created, leave the File Contents field blank. In the File to Upload field, click Choose File, and use the system dialog to select the file to upload. If the file is successfully uploaded, the filename is shown in the File to Upload field. The contents of the uploaded file is shown in the File Contents field. If you need to make edits, you can do so directly. Click Create to save your changes and store the profile. When you have created an autoinstallation profile, you can edit it by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and selecting the profile you want to edit. Make the desired changes and save your settings by clicking Create. If you change the Virtualization Type of an existing Kickstart profile, it might also modify the bootloader and partition options, potentially overwriting any custom settings. Carefully review the Partitioning tab to verify these settings before making changes. When you install VM guests automatically, they are not registered to Uyuni. If you want your guests to be automatically registered as soon as they are installed, you can add a section to the autoinstallation profile that invokes a bootstrap script, and registers the guests. This section gives instructions for adding a bootstrap script to an existing AutoYaST profile. For more information about creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script. For instructions on how to do this for Kickstart, refer to the Red Hat documentation for your installation. Procedure: Adding a Bootstrap Script to an AutoYaST Profile Ensure your bootstrap script contains the activation key for the VM guests you want to register with it, and that is located on the host at /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap_vm_guests.sh. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles, and select the AutoYaST profile to associate this script with. In the File Contents field, add this snippet at the end of the file, immediately before the closing </profile> tag. Ensure you replace the example IP address 192.168.1.1 in the snippet with the correct IP address for your Uyuni Server: <scripts> <init-scripts config:type=\"list\"> <script> <interpreter>shell</interpreter> <location> http://192.168.1.1/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_vm_guests.sh </location> </script> </init-scripts> </scripts> Click Update to save your changes. If your AutoYaST profile already contains a <scripts> section, do not add a second one. Place the bootstrap snippet inside the existing <scripts> section. When you have everything set up, you can start to autoinstall your VM guests. Each VM host can only install one guest at a time. If you are scheduling more than one autoinstallation, make sure you time them so that the next installation does not begin before the previous one has completed. If a guest installation starts while another one is still running, the running installation is canceled. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Overview, and select the VM host you want to install guests on. Navigate to the Virtualization tab, and the Provisioning subtab. Select the autoinstallation profile you want to use, and specify a unique name for the guest. Choose a proxy if applicable and enter a schedule. To change the guest’s hardware profile and configuration options, click Advanced Options. Click Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish to complete. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to manage your VM Guests, including actions like shutting down, restarting, and adjusting CPU, and memory allocations. To do this, you need your Xen or KVM VM host registered to the Uyuni Server, and have the libvirtd service running on the host. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List, and click on the VM host for the guests you want to manage. Navigate to the Virtualization tab to see all guests registered to this host, and access the management functions.

In this type of installation, a virtual host is installed on the Uyuni Server to manage any number of virtual guests. If you choose to, you can install several virtual hosts to manage groups of guests. The range of capabilities that virtualized clients have depends on the third-party virtualization provider you choose. Xen and KVM hosts and guests can be managed directly in Uyuni. This enables you to autoinstall hosts and guests using AutoYaST or Kickstart, and manage guests in the Web UI. For VMware, including VMware vSphere, and Nutanix AHV, Uyuni requires you to set up a virtual host manager (VHM) to control the VMs. This gives you control over the hosts and guests, but in a more limited way than available with Xen and KVM; Uyuni cannot create or edit VMs on VMware vSphere or Nutanix AHV. Other third-party virtualization providers are not directly supported by Uyuni. However, if your provider allows you to export a JSON configuration file for the VM, you can upload that configuration file to Uyuni and manage it with a VHM. For more information about using VHMs to manage virtualization, see Virtual Host Managers. Before you begin, ensure that the client you want to use as a virtualization host has the Virtualization Host system type assigned to it. Navigate to Systems Systems List and click the name of the client to use as a virtualization host. If the Virtualization Host system type is not listed, initialize the Virtualization Host formula. For more information, see client-configuration:virt-xenkvm.adoc#virt-xenkvm-host. When a client has the Virtualization Host system type, the Virtualization tab is available in the System Details page for the client. The Virtualization tab allows you to create and manage virtual guests, and manage storage pools and virtual networks. You can add virtual guests to your virtualization hosts within the Uyuni Web UI. Procedure: Creating a Virtual Guest In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List, click the name of the virtualization host, and navigate to the Virtualization tab. In the General section, complete these details: In the Guests subtab, click Create Guest. In the Name field, type the name of the guest. In the Hypervisor field, select the hypervisor to use. In the Virtual Machine Type field, select either fully virtualized or para-virtualized. In the Maximum Memory field, type the upper size limit for the guest disk, in MiB. In the Virtual CPU count, type the number of vCPUs for the guest. In the Architecture field, select the emulated CPU architecture to use on the guest. By default, the architecture selected matches the virtual host. In the Auto-installation Profile field, select the auto-installation tool to use to install the guest. Leave this field blank if you do not want to use auto-installation. In the Disks section, complete the details of the virtual disk to use with the client. In the Source template image URL field, ensure you type the path to an operating system image. If you do not do this, your guest is created with an empty disk. In the Networks section, complete the details of the virtual network interface to use with the client. Leave the MAC address field blank to generate a MAC address. In the Graphics section, complete the details of the graphics driver to use with the client. Schedule a time for the guest to be created, and click Create to create the guest. The new virtual guest starts as soon as it has successfully been created. You can add virtual guests on a pacemaker cluster within the Uyuni Web UI, too. Procedure: Creating a Cluster Managed Virtual Guest Follow the Creating a Virtual Guest procedure on one of the nodes of the cluster with the following additions: Ensure the Define as a cluster resource field is checked. In the Path to the cluster shared folder for VM definitions field, type the path to a folder shared by all cluster nodes where the guest configuration will be stored.

Preface","hash":"_preface","id":1}]},"159":{"id":159,"text":"Uyuni is all about managing client systems. So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients. This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see Supported Clients and Features. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see Registration Methods. Procedure: Configure a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on Your Client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.MLM.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.MLM.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare Software Channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Automated update of clients is benefitial when: update of a large number of clients is wanted the workflow should not be re-done every execution a dedicated maintenance window exists. Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent and supportable state. Before you start, you should have a number of clients onboarded. It may make sense to have them sorted into groups you want to update together. In this workflow we use a system group named infra-services. To update a client two steps are required. A third step is optional but highly recommended to finalize the update process. Procedure 1: Creating a Recurring Action to Update Salt Itself As an example, we create the action to update Salt itself as a recurring action for all systems in the organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like update-salt. Select a schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:00 am . Assign the update-salt state by selecting the checkbox. Click Save Changes to save the action. You can edit the execution order of the states if needed. Click Confirm to confirm the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 2: Creating a Recurring Action to Apply All Available Updates to the Systems As an example we create the action to apply all updates as a recurring action for a system group called infra-services. In the Uyuni Web UI go to Systems System Groups and click on infra-services. Now go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like full-system-update. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:30 am . Keep enough time between this action and the update-salt action. The update-salt actions must be finished on all systems before this action should be executed. Assign the states util.syncall, certs, channels and uptodate by selecting the checkboxes. To perform a reboot afterwards you can also add reboot or rebootifneeded. Save the action by clicking Save Changes. You can edit the execution order of the states. The order should be util.syncall, certs, channels, uptodate and finally reboot or rebootifneeded if chosen. Click Confirm to store the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 4: Creating a Recurring Action to Run a Highstate After the Update As an example, we create the action to apply the highstate for the same group which was fully updated before. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click infra-services. Go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Highstate and enter a Schedule Name like highstate. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 10:30 am . Again, keep enough time between this action and the full-system-update action. Click Create Schedule to save the action. The uptodate state applies critical patches to the update components. On SUSE-based systems, the state executes the command: zypper --non-interactive patch --updatestack-only And then, the state also updates Salt. On all the other systems, not based on SUSE, the state only updates Salt. The state runs the package manager, such as dnf, yum, apt, or zypper based on what is available on the client operating system to update the rest of the packages. The state lists all of the upgradable packages, based on the synchronized package repositories in Uyuni. The state upgrades the packages to their latest available version by using the client’s package manager. The executed command depends on the operating system of the client: For Debian-based clients, such as Debian or Ubuntu, the action executes apt dist-upgrade -q -y $PACKAGES. For RPM-based clients that are not SUSE, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Liberty Linux, the action executes yum --quiet -y update $PACKAGES or dnf --quiet -y upgrade $PACKAGES (depending on the package manager the client is using). For non-transactional SUSE clients, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, the action executes zypper --non-interactive --auto-agree-with-licenses update $PACKAGES. For transactional SUSE clients, the action executes the same in a transactional shell. Uyuni provides the reboot and rebootifneeded actions. Use one of the actions if you want your client to reboot after the package upgrade. rebootifneeded Reboot detection is specific to the client operating system. For Debian or Ubuntu, see https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#signaling-that-a-reboot-is-required. For non-transactional SUSE clients, Uyuni reboots the client when zypper -x list-patches indicates that the patches require a reboot. For transactional SUSE clients, Uyuni reboots the client if there is a pending transaction. For the Red Hat-based clients, Uyuni reboots the client if dnf -q needs-restarting -r indicates that a reboot is required. For more information, see the reboot_info.py module: https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/blob/master/susemanager-utils/susemanager-sls/src/modules/reboot_info.py For more information about recurring actions, see Recurring Actions.

CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server deployed, and accessible using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. Procedure: Create a new CLM Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects section, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. Leave the Filters section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example. You can add filters later on if you need to. In the Environment Lifecycle section, create three environments: production, testing, and development. Click Add Environment and complete the name and label for each. For the production environment, leave the Insert before field blank. For the testing environment, in the Insert before field, select production. For the development environment, in the Insert before field, select testing. Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign Clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel <CLM_Project_Name>-production-<Channel_Name>. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel <CLM_Project_Name>-testing-<Channel_Name>. Click Next to assign the client. Procedure: Promote Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section.

In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade <listentry> <ask_on_error config:type=\"boolean\">true</ask_on_error> #if $channel_prefix != \"\" <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #else <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #end if <name>$channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool</name> <product>sle-manager-tools</product> </listentry> Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration. Procedure: Migrating Clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console.","title":"In-place Upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The goal of this connection is to extract authentication data so the Uyuni Server can connect to a cloud RMT host. Then the Uyuni Server has access to products on the RMT host that are not already available with the SCC organization credentials. Before using PAYG feature make sure that: The PAYG instance is launched from the correct SUSE product image (for example, SLES, SLES for SAP, or SLE HPC) to allow access to the desired repositories Uyuni Server has connectivity to the PAYG instance (ideally in the same region) either directly or via a bastion A basic SCC account is required. Enter your valid SCC credentials in Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials. This account is required for accessing the Uyuni client tools for boostrapping regardless of PAYG instances. If you bootstrap the PAYG instance to SUSE Manager, SUSE Manager will disable its PAYG repositories then add repositories from where it mirrored the data from the RMT server. The final result will be PAYG instances acquiring the same repositories from the RMT servers but through the SUSE Manager server itself. Of course repositories can still be setup primarily from SCC. Procedure: Connecting new PAYG instance In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard PAYG, and click Add PAYG. Start with the page section PAYG connection Description. In the Description field, add the description. Move to the page section Instance SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the instance DNS or IP address to connect from Uyuni. In the SSH Port field, enter the port number or use default value 22. In the User field, enter the username as specified in the cloud. In the Password field, enter the password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the instance key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the key passphrase. Authentication keys must always be in PEM format.

Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data Navigate to the page section Bastion SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the bastion hostname. In the SSH Port field, enter the bastion port number. In the User field, enter the bastion username. In the Password field, enter the bastion password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the bastion key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the bastion key passphrase. Complete the setup process with with Procedure: Finishing PAYG connecting. Procedure: Finishing PAYG connecting To complete adding new PAYG connection data, click Create. Return to PAYG connection data Details page. The updated connection status is displayed on the top section named Information. Connection status is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go screen too. If the authentication data for the instance are correct, the column Status shows \"Credentials successfully updated.\" If the invalid data are entered at any point, the newly created instance is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > PAYG, with column Status displaying error message. As soon as the authentication data is available on the server, the list of available products is updated. Available products are all versions of the same product family and architecture as the one installed in the PAYG instance. For example, if the instance has the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 product installed, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5 are automatically shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > Products. Once the products are shown as available, the user can add a product to Uyuni by selecting the checkbox next to the product name and clicking Add product. After the success message you can verify the newly added channels in the Web UI, by navigating to Software > Channel List > All. To monitor the syncing progress of each channel, check the log files in the /var/log/rhn/reposync directory on the Uyuni Server. If a product is provided by both the PAYG instance and one of the SCC subscriptions, it will appear only once in the products list. When the channels belonging to that product are synced, the data might still come from the SCC subscription, and not from the Pay-As-You-Go instance. The following procedure describes how to delete SSH connection data of the instance. Procedure: Deleting connection data to instance Open Admin > Setup Wizard > PAYG. Find the instance on the list of existing instances. Click on the instance details. Select Delete and confirm your selection. You are returned to the list of instances. The one that was just deleted is no longer shown. Uyuni server uses credentails collected from the instance to connect to the RMT server and to download the packages using reposync. These credentials are refreshed every 10 minutes by taskomatic using the defined SSH connection data. Connection to RMT server always uses the last known authentication credentials collected from the PAYG instance. The status of the PAYG instance credentials collect is shown in the column Status or on the instance details page. When the instance is not reachable, the credential update process will fail. When the instance is unreachable, the credential update process will fail and the credentials will become invalid after the second failed refresh. Synchronization of channels will fail when the credentials are invalid. To avoid this keep the connected instances running. PAYG instance remains connected to Uyuni server unless SSH connection data is explicitly deleted. To delete the SSH connection data to the instance, use Procedure: Deleting connection data to instance. PAYG instance may not be accessible from the Uyuni server at all times. If the instance exists, but is stopped, the last known credentials will be used to try to connect to the instance. How long the credentials remain valid depends on the cloud provider. If the instance no longer exists, but is still registered with SUMA, its credentials are no longer valid and the authentication will fail. The error message is shown in the column Status. The error message only indicates that the instance is not available. Further diagnostics about the status of the instance needs to be done on the cloud provider. Any of the following actions or changes in the PAYG instance will lead to credentials failing: * removing zypper credentials files * removing the imported certificates * removing cloud-specific entries from /etc/hosts You can register a PAYG instance from where you harvest the credentials as a Salt client. The instance needs to have a valid cloud connection registered, otherwise it will not have access to channels. If the user removes the cloud packages, the credentials harvesting may stop working. First set up the PAYG instance to collect authentication data, so it can synchronize the channels. The rest of the process is the same as for any non-public-cloud client and consists of synchronizing channels, automatic bootstrap script creation, activation key creation and starting the registration. For more about registering clients, see Client Registration. Checking the credentials If the script fails to collect the credentials, it should provide a proper error message in the logs and in the Web UI. If the credentials are not working, reposync should show the proper error. Using registercloudguest Refreshing or changing the registercloudguest connection to the public cloud update infrastructure should not interfere with the credentials usage. Running `registercloudguest --clean will cause problems if no new cloud connection is registered with the cloud guest command.","title":"Connect PAYG instance","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"connect-payg","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/connect-payg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For more information about swap space, see Swap space. 8 to 12 GB The images by default have a 40 GB / partition. The cloud image of SL Micro 6.1 has just a 5 GB / partition. Both work flawlessly with Uyuni. As long as external storage is mounted to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes, Uyuni does not need or use storage on the / partition, but leaves that to the management of the container host itself. Uyuni performance depends on hardware resources, network bandwidth, latency between clients and server, etc. Based on the experience and different deployments that are in use, the advice for optimal performance of Uyuni Server with an adequate number of proxies is to not exceed 10,000 clients per single server. It is highly recommended to move to the Hub setup and involve consultancy when you have more than 10,000 clients. Even with fine-tuning and an adequate number of proxies, such a large number of clients can lead to performance issues. For more information about managing a large number of clients, see Multiple Servers with Hub to Manage Large Scale Deployments. One of SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 is the operating system of the container host. Minimum requirements are suitable for a quick test installation, such as a Proxy with one client. If you want to use a production environment start with recommended values. Table 2. Proxy Hardware Requirements Hardware Details Recommendation CPU x86-64, ARM Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores Recommended The same as minimum values RAM Minimum 2 GB Recommended 8 GB Disk Space / (root directory) Minimum 40 GB /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Minimum 100 GB Swap space Systems can benefit from additional swap space. SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For more information about swap space, see Swap space. 4 to 8 GB By default the Uyuni Proxy container caches packages in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory. If there is not enough space available, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages. As a result of this behavior: The larger /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory is on the proxy, the less traffic will be between the proxy and the Uyuni Server. By making the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory on the proxy the same size as /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/ on the Uyuni Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization. The /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory can be small on the Uyuni Server compared to the proxy. For a guide to size estimation, see the Server Requirements section. In general, SUSE recommends to adjust the value for the cache directory to about 80 % of available free space. The cache_dir value is set when generating proxy configuration on the server. You cannot set the option directly in squid.conf. Workloads differ from system to system. Systems with heavy or unpredictable workloads can benefit from additional swap space, regardless of total RAM. It is recommended to place swap on the fastest available storage (for example, SSD). SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For size recommendations, see the tables above. The following shell command snippet creates a 8GiB swap file. A swap file on BtrFS filesystem prevent creating of a snapshot of that volume. /var in the following example is already excluded from the snapper snapshots, so it is safe to use /var/swap. ## setup swapfile at /var/swap # run following as a root user # allocate 8GiB for swap file fallocate -l 8G /var/swap # ensure CoW is disabled for the swap file chattr +C /var/swap # allow only root access chmod 600 /var/swap # make swap file based on allocated file mkswap /var/swap # activate swap use for the running system swapon /var/swap # activate swap during the next boots echo \"/var/swap swap swap defaults 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab PostgreSQL is the only supported database. Using a remote PostgreSQL database or remote file systems (such as NFS) with the PostgreSQL database is not supported. In other words, PostgreSQL should be on the fastest available storage device for Uyuni. Because of potential performance issues, running a PostgreSQL database remotely from Uyuni is discouraged. While such an environment is possible and even stable in many cases, there is always a risk of data loss if something goes wrong. Persistent volumes are created by default when deploying the container. However, it is recommended that the volumes are stored on one or more separate storage devices. Such a setup helps avoid data loss in production environments. This can be done after container deployment. Storage devices best should be set up after first deploying the container. For more details, see Persistent Container Volumes. We recommend you use XFS as the filesystem type for all volumes. The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with Uyuni. See the tables in this section for guides to estimate the size required. Do not use NFS for Cobbler or PostgreSQL storage, neither NFS on SELinux environments. These scenarios are not supported. On the Uyuni Server, use this command to find all available storage devices: hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" Use the lsblk command to see the name and size of each device. Use the mgr-storage-server command with the device names to set up the external disks as the locations for the storage and, optionally on a disk of its own, for the database: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] For example: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 The external storage volumes are set up as XFS partitions mounted at /manager_storage and /pgsql_storage. This command will create the persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes. It is possible to use the same storage device for both channel data and the database. This is not recommended, as growing channel repositories might fill up the storage, which poses a risk to database integrity. Using separate storage devices may also increase performance. If you want to use a single storage device, run mgr-storage-server with a single device name parameter. If you are installing a proxy, the mgr-storage-proxy command takes only one device name parameter and will set up the external storage location as the Squid cache. For all kind of virtual machines (VM), LVM is generally not needed and not recommended. The disk setup is virtual and separate disks for volumes are possible and recommended. For other deployments, separate disks for volumes are also recommended. On the container host of the Uyuni Server, the mgr-storage-server command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. Optionally, if a second device name is specified, mgr-storage-server moves the content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql database directory to a second separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql. Similarly, on the container host of the Uyuni Proxy, the mgr-storage-proxy command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes.","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

IP forwarding will be enabled by containerized installation. This means Uyuni Server and Proxies will behave as a router. This behavior is done by podman directly. Podman containers do not run if IP forwarding is disabled. Consider achieving network isolation of the Uyuni environment according to your policies. For more information, see https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020166. The Uyuni server must resolve its FQDN correctly. If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause serious problems in a number of different components. For more information about configuring the hostname and DNS, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-network.html#sec-network-yast-change-host. To ensure that the Uyuni domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server. You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured. For more information about setting up a DNS server, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-dns.html. When the Uyuni is installed using mgradm install podman or mgrpxy install podman, it sets up Podman which enables IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding. This is needed for communication from the outside of the container. However, if your system previously had /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/accept_ra set to 1, it will stop using router advertisements. As a result, the routes are no longer obtained via router advertisements and the default IPv6 route is missing. To recover correct functioning of the IPv6 routing, follow the procedure: Procedure: Reenabling router advertisements Create a file in /etc/sysctl.d, for example 99-ipv6-ras.conf. Add the following parameter and value to the file: net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_ra = 2 Reboot. Some environments enforce internet access through a HTTP or HTTPS proxy. This could be a Squid server or similar. To allow the Uyuni Server internet access in such configuration, you need to configure the following. Procedure: Configuring HTTP or HTTPS OSI level 7 proxy For operating system internet access, modify /etc/sysconfig/proxy according to your needs: PROXY_ENABLED=\"no\" HTTP_PROXY=\"\" HTTPS_PROXY=\"\" NO_PROXY=\"localhost, 127.0.0.1\" For Podman container internet access, modify /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service.d/custom.conf according to your needs. For example, set: [Service] Environment=TZ=Europe/Berlin Environment=\"PODMAN_EXTRA_ARGS=\" Environment=\"https_proxy=user:password@http://192.168.10.1:3128\" For Java application internet access, modify /etc/rhn/rhn.conf according to your needs. On the container host, execute mgrctl term to open a command line inside the server container: Modify /etc/rhn/rhn.conf according to your needs. For example, set: # Use proxy FQDN, or FQDN:port server.satellite.http_proxy = server.satellite.http_proxy_username = server.satellite.http_proxy_password = # no_proxy is a comma seperated list server.satellite.no_proxy = On the container host, restart the server to enforce the new configuration: systemctl restart uyuni-server.service If you are on an internal network and do not have access to SUSE Customer Center, you can use an Air-gapped Deployment. In a production environment, the Uyuni Server and clients should always use a firewall. For a comprehensive list of the required ports, see Required Network Ports. This section contains a comprehensive list of ports that are used for various communications within Uyuni. You will not need to open all of these ports. Some ports only need to be opened if you are using the service that requires them. External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the Uyuni Server to protect the server from unauthorized access. Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the Uyuni Server. Table 1. External Port Requirements for Uyuni Server Port number Protocol Used By Notes 67 TCP/UDP DHCP Required only if clients are requesting IP addresses from the server. 69 TCP/UDP TFTP Required if server is used as a PXE server for automated client installation. 80 TCP HTTP Required temporarily for some bootstrap repositories and automated installations. 443 TCP HTTPS Serves the Web UI, client, and server and proxy (tftpsync) requests. 4505 TCP salt Required to accept communication requests from clients.

Port 32768 and higher are used as ephemeral ports. These are most often used to receive TCP connections. When a TCP connection request is received, the sender will choose one of these ephemeral port numbers to match the destination port. You can use this command to find out which ports are ephemeral ports: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the Uyuni Proxy to protect the proxy from unauthorized access. Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the Uyuni proxy. Table 4.

There are some URLs that Uyuni must be able to access to register clients and perform updates. In most cases, allowing access to these URLs is sufficient: scc.suse.com updates.suse.com installer-updates.suse.com registry.suse.com registry-storage.suse.com You can find additional details on whitelisting the specified URLs and their associated IP addresses in this article: Accessing SUSE Customer Center and SUSE registry behind a firewall and/or through a proxy. If you are using non-SUSE clients you might also need to allow access to other servers that provide specific packages for those operating systems. For example, if you have Ubuntu clients, you will need to be able to access the Ubuntu server.

We have tested these instructions on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but they should work on other providers as well, with some variation. Before you begin, here are some considerations: The Uyuni setup procedure performs a forward-confirmed reverse DNS lookup. This must succeed in order for the setup procedure to complete and for Uyuni to operate as expected. It is important to perform hostname and IP configuration before you set up Uyuni. Uyuni Server and Proxy instances need to run in a network configuration that provides you control over DNS entries, but cannot be accessed from the internet at large. Within this network configuration DNS resolution must be provided: hostname -f must return the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). DNS resolution is also important for connecting clients. DNS is dependent on the cloud framework you choose. Refer to the cloud provider documentation for detailed instructions. We recommend that you locate software repositories, the server database, and the proxy squid cache on an external virtual disk. This prevents data loss if the instance is unexpectedly terminated. This section includes instructions for setting up an external virtual disk. When you use Uyuni on a public cloud, you must use a restricted network. We recommend using a VPC private subnet with an appropriate firewall setting. Only machines in your specified IP ranges must be able to access the instance. Running Uyuni on the public cloud means implementing robust security measures. It is essential to limit, filter, monitor, and audit access to the instance. SUSE strongly advises against a globally accessible Uyuni instance that lacks adequate perimeter security. To access the Uyuni Web UI, allow HTTPS when configuring the network access controls. This allows you to access the Uyuni Web UI. In EC2 and Azure, create a new security group, and add inbound and outbound rules for HTTPS. In GCE, check the Allow HTTPS traffic box under the Firewall section. We recommend that the repositories and the database for Uyuni are stored on separate storage devices from the root volume. This will help to avoid data loss and possibly increase performance. The Uyuni container utilizes default storage locations. These locations should be configured prior to deployment for custom storage. For more information see Persistent container volumes Do not use logical volume management (LVM) for public cloud installations. The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with Uyuni. When you attach the virtual disks, they will appear in your instance as Unix device nodes. The names of the device nodes will vary depending on your provider, and the instance type selected. Ensure the root volume of the Uyuni Server is 100 GB or larger. Add an additional storage disk of 500 GB or more, and choose SSD storage if you can. The cloud images for Uyuni Server use a script to assign this separate volume when your instance is launched. When you launch your instance, you can log in to the Uyuni Server and use this command to find all available storage devices: hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" If you are not sure which device to choose, use the lsblk command to see the name and size of each device. Choose the name that matches with the size of the virtual disk you are looking for. You can set up the external disk with the mgr-storage-server command. This creates an XFS partition mounted at /manager_storage and uses it as the location for the database and repositories: /usr/bin/mgr-storage-server <devicename>","title":"Public Cloud Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"pubcloud-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/pubcloud-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

Procedure: Troubleshooting Synchronization Problems Log the HTTP output into /var/log/zypper.log: ZYPP_MEDIA_CURL_DEBUG=2 spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label> Export the setting: export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG Start the synchronization: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label> --type yum You can increase the debug level, by adding the [option]``-vvv`` option to the command. When the complete completes, or fails, disable debug mode: unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG You can add custom HTTP headers to the requests made by spacewalk-repo-sync at the time of synchronization. The custom HTTP headers are defined in the /etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf configuration file. The headers can be defined by repository name or channel label. You can also define global headers by putting them in the main section. For example: [testchannel] X-MY-HEADER-1=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-2=VALUE [mychannel] X-MY-HEADER-3=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-4=VALUE [main] X-MYGLOBAL-HEADER=VALUE This can be particularly useful when dealing with Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repositories in the public cloud.","title":"Synchronization CLI Tools","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"cli-sync","url":"/uyuni/reference/cli-sync.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Preface","hash":"_preface","id":1}]},"190":{"id":190,"text":"To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configures DHCP for PXE booting. Without the formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. For more information how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server, see DHCPd Formula. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using the newest Uyuni Server. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Procedure Create the following three system groups. For guidelines on how to create the groups, see System Groups. TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 The first group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. The second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. The third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. This converts the branch group to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name and Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot Group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy, fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. For explanation of possible configurations, see Terminal Names. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server, where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is built and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Procedure: Deploying with containerized workflow Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Procedure: Deploying with non-ontainerized workflow Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example, when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with which parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The hardware type group (i.e. HWTYPE group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the Saltboot formula. This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. Procedure: Dual group image deployment Build new image. Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Controlling image versions","hash":"_controlling_image_versions","id":2}]},"196":{"id":196,"text":"Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see Image Building and Management. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The Saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the Saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the Saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the Saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The format of the parameters must be <NAME>-<VERSION> and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar in the database. Performance tuning is possible with the -B <VALUE> option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see [retail.deployterminals.auto.once]. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, which is preserved in etc-salt volume. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept At the command prompt of the Uyuni container host, as root, enter the server container: mgrctl term Inside the container, execute the following steps: In directory /etc/salt/master.d/, create file autosign_grains.conf and specify autosign_grains_dir: echo \"autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains\" \\ > /etc/salt/master.d/autosign_grains.conf Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot (replace <AUTOSIGN_KEY> with the key: mkdir /etc/salt/autosign_grains echo \"<AUTOSIGN_KEY>\" > /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key For multiple keys, put each one on a new line. For more information about configuring the server to automatically accept grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/autoaccept_grains.html. Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY> # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY> # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the <packages type=\"image\"> element, add: <archive name=\"autosign.tgz\" bootinclude=\"true\"/> Save the file and rebuild the image.

You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create <usb image name> <size in MB> Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if=<usb image name> of=<path to usb device> When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. Build the image. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt <terminal_salt_name> state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Terminals can be either x86-64 or arm64 architecture. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see Image Building and Management. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Manual synchronization of images is needed only when using non-containerized Uyuni for Retail 4.3 branch server. Image synchronization downloads system and boot images from the Uyuni Server to the Uyuni for Retail branch server. This may involve updating default boot image for not yet registered terminals. Default boot image can be set in the Image Synchronize formula. If default boot image is not set, boot image with highest version is used as default boot image. This behaviour can be disabled by unchecking Use Latest Boot Image checkbox in the Image Synchronize formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_salt_id> state.apply image-sync When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. Create the top.sls file with content: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Create the saltboot_proto.sls file with content: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp saltboot_proto.sls server:/srv/pillar/ Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. Create the top.sls file with content: base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Create the $branch_prefix.sls file with content: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp $branch_prefix.sls server:/srv/pillar/","title":"Deployment basics","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server. The following formulas can be used for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3 with Uyuni 5.0: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula In addition, Bind and DHCPd formulas can be used, but not on the branch server because SLE Micro does not have Bind and DHCPd in the repositories. Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services.

You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see Image Building and Management. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. For more information about system groups, see System Groups. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible Integration. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"<FQDN of branch server proxy>/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_minion_id> state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly. For more information about Image Synchronization Formula, see Image Synchronization Formula.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment with non-containerized 4.3 branch server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup-43","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup-43.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server group, you will need to have images prepared already. If you are configuring more than one branch server, the same images are reused across different branch server groups. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. For information about Uyuni image building, see Image Building and Management. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. POS image templates and resulting images do not set a system user password. You will not be able to login as a system user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template without customization. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user password. You can use Salt to set up a system user password after the terminal has been deployed. After POS image is successfully built and inspected by Uyuni, you can validate that POS boot image was correctly registered by following procedure. Procedure Validate POS boot image On Uyuni command line execute following command: mgrctl exec cobbler distro list Your POS image should be listed with organization number before image name For every branch server choose branch id. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. For more information about system groups, see System Groups. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. In case you plan to use the branch server container host as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. In case you plan to use the branch server container host with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible Integration. Before configuring Saltboot group, make sure you already have at least one POS image available. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured using so called Saltboot Group. Saltboot groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name created in previous step, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula previously used in Uyuni for Retail setups. To connect Saltboot Group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Listing 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"<FQDN of branch server proxy>/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"grub/shim.efi\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } else { filename \"pxelinux.0\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Uyuni for Retail branch proxy uses different filename then previous non-containerized branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires instructions how to partitioning terminal harddisk and what image to deploy. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types and partitioning, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Uyuni for Retail 2025.07 no longer need manual image synchronization, all images are available to all clients automatically. This may not be always desired, for example to allow images gradual deployments across all branches. For a way how to limit image deployment, see Best practices.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Mass configuration tool was not yet adapted for containerized saltboot workflow. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula.

Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image using API call using spacecmd command In the console run following the command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_redeployment\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to repartition disk using API call using spacecmd command In the console run the following command, replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_repartition\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Check Saltboot tuning options In the console run the following command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot' system.getPillar Make sure to use tuning-saltboot as pillar category in the API call. Pillars specified outside of Uyuni database cannot be reset automatically. Without manual intervention, the terminal will download a new image on each reboot. Procedure: Force a Saltboot to redeploy image using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_redeploy.sls with content: saltboot: force_redeploy: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_redeploy Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After the terminal finishes booting, remove modifications made in /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls file. If your terminal encounters a problem with the file system or the partition table, you might need to remove the partition table and reformat the terminal. Procedure: Force Saltboot to repartition disk using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_repartition.sls with content: saltboot: force_repartition: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_repartition Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.

Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, HWType, and MAC. Naming scheme and its configuration can be selected in the Saltboot Group formula for containerized branch servers or in the Branch Network formula for others. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy and Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID For example: B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID For example: B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID For example: B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. Terminal names are derived from the network interface hardware address (MAC) and use this format: BranchID.MAC-UniqueID For example: B0002.52:54:00:62:18:6f-cb83 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The MAC is colon delimited hardware address of the network interface card used for booting of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the non-containerized branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet <terminal_MAC_address> OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: <IP_Address> hwAddress: <MAC_Address> hwtype: <HWTYPE_Group_name_without_HWTYPE:_prefix> Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name.

For proxy installation procedures, see Containerized Uyuni Proxy Setup. Then continue with the following sections. Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. The products you need for this procedure are: Table 1. openSUSE Channels - CLI OS Version openSUSE Leap 15.4 Base Channel opensuse_leap15_4 Client Channel opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-updates Non-OSS Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss Non-OSS Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates Backports Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates SLE Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the spacewalk-common-channels command to add the appropriate channels: spacewalk-common-channels \\ <base_channel_name> \\ <child_channel_name_1> \\ <child_channel_name_2> \\ ... <child_channel_name_n> Synchronize the channels: mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Procedure: Trusting GPG Keys on Clients On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key If you are bootstrapping clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) For more information about creating activation keys, see Activation Keys. You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration. A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see Containerized Uyuni Proxy Setup. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types. Configure the proxy to become a branch server. On the Uyuni for Retail Server, for example, run: retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id> --dedicated-nic eth1 \\ --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \\ --netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \\ --server-domain branch.example.org \\ --branch-prefix uyuni For additional options, use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.","title":"Retail Uyuni Branch Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-uyuni-branchserver","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-uyuni-branchserver.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For example, conflicting packages with higher version numbers could be included into the bootstrap repository. Such packages (for example, python3-zmq or zeromq) may corrupt the creation of the bootstrap repository or cause issues during bootstrap of the client. When the custom channel (for example, an EPEL channel) is added below the parent vendor channel, issues with conflicting packages cannot be solved directly. The way how to solve this is to separate the custom channel from the vendor channel. The custom channel needs to be created in a separate tree. In case that the custom channel needs to be delivered as a child, such environemnt can be created using Content Lifecycle Management (CLM). Sources in a CLM project can be added there from different trees. Using such an approach, the custom channel stays below the parent within the built environment. However, the vendor channel tree stays without the custom channel and the bootstrap repository. Then registering clients works correctly. When the custom channel with the conflicting packages (salt, zeromq, and so on) is created as a child channel, following steps can help to avoid the issue: Procedure: Avoiding Conflicting Packages in Custom Channels Remove the custom channel as a child channel from parent channel. For more information, see administration:custom-channels.adoc#_manage_custom_channels. Create the custom channel in a separate tree. For more information, see administration:custom-channels.adoc#_creating_custom_channels_and_repositories. To get the custom channel as a child channel within Content Lifecycle Management (CLM): In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle, and click Create Project. Enter Name and Label. Attach Source to the project. Use the needed vendor channels and the custom channel. (sharing example using CentOS8) Add environment into the Project. For example, use CentOS8. To build the environment click the Build button. This creates an environment with vendor and custom channels that can be associated with an activation key and used to bootstrap the client. Important note: In the CLM project, it is recommend to add a filter, which excludes the problematic or conflicting packages. Otherwise the conflicting packages with higher version numbers would be installed during the update of the client. For more information about filtering, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version. To get the latest patches into the CLM environment (with vendor and custom channel), click the Build button in the project. This is needed to re-built the environment.

To resolve this, you can add a small amount of storage temporarily to the filesystem using the btrfs device add command. This will allow you to delete files to gain space for further filesystem maintenance. When done with the maintenance, you can remove the temporary storage with btrfs device delete.

If it is set to DROP then you might find that synchronizing with the SUSE Customer Center times out. This occurs because the synchronization process needs to access third-party repositories that provide packages for non-SUSE clients, and not just the SUSE Customer Center. When the Uyuni Server attempts to reach these repositories to check that they are valid, the firewall drops the requests, and the synchronization continues to wait for the response until it times out. If this occurs, the synchronization takes a long time before it fails, and your non-SUSE products are not shown in the product list. You can fix this problem in several different ways. The simplest method is to configure your firewall to allow access to the URLs required by non-SUSE repositories. This allows the synchronization process to reach the URLs and complete successfully. If allowing external traffic is not possible, configure your firewall to REJECT requests from Uyuni instead of DROP. This rejects requests to third-party URLs, so that the synchronization fails early rather than times out, and the products are not shown in the list.

To accomplish this, Cobbler uses a list of proxies specified in /etc/cobbler/settings. Due to its design, cobbler sync is not able to sync only the changed or recently added files. Instead, executing cobbler sync triggers a full sync of the /srv/tftpboot directory to all specified proxies configured in /etc/cobbler/settings. It is also influenced by the latency of the WAN connection between the involved systems. The process of syncing may take a considerable amount of time to finish according to the logs in /var/log/cobbler/. For example, it started at: Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running python triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* and ended at: Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/post/* Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | shell triggers finished successfully The transfer amount was roughly 1.8 GB. The transfer took almost 30 minutes. By comparison, copying a single big file of the same size as /srv/tftboot completes within several minutes. Switching to an rsync-based approach to copy files between Uyuni Server and Proxy may help to reduce the transfer and wait times. A script to accomplish this task is available for download at https://suse.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/1i000000gLOd/a/1i000000ll5B/B2AmvIJN2_JsAyjTQzCVP_x5ioVgd0bYN9X9NpMugS8. The script does not accept command line options. Before running the script, you need to manually edit it and set correctly MLMHOSTNAME, MLMIP and MLMPROXY1 variables for it to work correctly. There is no support available for individual adjustments of the script. The script and the comments inside aim to provide an overview of the process and steps to be taken into consideration. If further help is required, contact SUSE Consulting. The proposed approach using the script is beneficial in the following environment: Uyuni Proxy systems are connected via a WAN connection; /srv/tftboot contains a high number of files for distributions and client PXE boot files, in total several thousand files; Any proxy in /etc/cobbler/settings has been disabled, otherwise Uyuni will continue to sync content to the proxies. #proxies: # - \"MLMproxy.MLMproxy.test\" # - \"MLMproxy2.MLMproxy.test\" Procedure: Analyzing New Sync Speed Take a dump of the TCP traffic between Uyuni and the involved systems. On Uyuni Server: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host <ip-address-of-susemanagerproxy> and not ssh On Uyuni Proxy: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host <ip-address-of-susemanager> and not ssh This will only capture a package size of 200 which is sufficient to run an analysis. Adjust ethX to the respective network interface Uyuni uses to communicate with the proxy. At last, ssh communication will not be captured to reduce the number of packages even further. Start a cobbler sync. To force a sync, delete the Cobbler json cache file first and then issue cobbler sync: rm /var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json cobbler sync When {command]cobbler sync is finished, stop the TCPdumps. Open the TCPdumps using Wireshark, go to Statistics > Conversations and wait for the dump to be analyzed. Switch to the TCP tab. The number shown on this tab gives the total number of conversations captured between Uyuni Server and Uyuni Proxy. Look for the column Duration. Start by sorting in ascending order to find out the minimal amount of time it took to transfer a file. Continue by sorting in descending order to find out the maximum values for the big files, for example kernel and initrd transfers. Ignore ports 4505 and 4506 as these are used for Salt communication. Analysis of the TCPdumps showed the transfer of small files with a size of approx. 1800 bytes from Uyuni Server to Proxy took around 0.3 seconds. While there were not many big files, the high number of smaller files resulted high number of established connections as new TCP connection is created for every single transferred file. Therefore, knowing the minimal amount of transfer time and a number of connections needed (approx. 5000 in the example), gives an approximate estimated time for the overall transfer time: 5000 * 0.3 / 60 = 25 minutes.","title":"Troubleshooting high sync times between Uyuni Server and Proxy over WAN connections","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan","url":"/uyuni/administration/troubleshooting/tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan.html","titles":[]},"236":{"id":236,"text":"If you change the hostname of the Uyuni Server locally, your Uyuni installation ceases to work properly. This is because the changes have not been made in the database, which prevents the changes from propagating out your clients and any proxies.

This script updates the settings in the PostgreSQL database and the internal structures of Uyuni. The spacewalk-hostname-rename script is part of the spacewalk-utils package. The only mandatory parameter for the script is the newly configured IP address of the Uyuni Server. Procedure: Renaming Uyuni Server Change the network settings of the server on the system level locally and remotely at the DNS server. You also need to provide configuration settings for reverse name resolution. Changing network settings is done in the same way as with renaming any other system.

When the Salt client is restarted, or in case the grains are refreshed, the client calculates its FQDN grains, and it is unresponsive until the grains are proceeded.

GPG Key Removal from spacewalk-repo-sync When a GPG key for repository has been manually imported using spacewalk-repo-sync, and this key is no longer needed (for example if the the key was compromised, or was used for testing purposes only), it can be removed from the zypper RPM database used by spacewalk-repo-sync with the following command: rpm --dbpath=/var/lib/spacewalk/reposync/root/var/lib/rpm/ -e gpg-pubkey-* where gpg-pubkey-* is the name of the GPG key to be removed. Renewing GPG Key If you want to renew a GPG key, first remove the old key, and then generate and import a new one.

You can resolve this error by running the synchronization from the command prompt with the -Y option: spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channelname> -Y This option verifies the repository data before the synchronization, rather than relying on locally cached checksums. Connection Timeout If the download times out with the following error: 28, 'Operation too slow.

However, you cannot install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel.

In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Because Debian based systems sign only metadata, there is no need to specify extra keys for single channels. If a user configures an own GPG key to sign the metadata as described in \"Use Your Own GPG Key\" in Repository Metadata the deployment and trust of that key is executed automatically. Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. By providing some pillar data and providing the GPG key files in the Salt filesystem, they are automatically deployed to the client.

Procedure: Installing SL Micro 6.1 Insert the DVD or USB flash drive (USB disk or key) containing the installation image for SLE Micro 6.1. Boot or reboot your system. Use the arrow keys to select Installation. Adjust Keyboard and language. Click the checkbox to accept the license agreement. Click Next to continue. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. The Uyuni 2025.07 containers are installed as extensions. Depending on the specific extension needed from the list below, additional SUSE Customer Center registration codes will be required for each. Uyuni 2025.07 Server Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy Uyuni 2025.07 Retail Branch Server The SL Micro 6.1 entitlement is included within the Uyuni entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code. Enter your SUSE Customer Center email address. Enter your registration code for SL Micro 6.1. Click Next to continue. To install a proxy, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy extension; to install a server, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Server extension Checkbox. Click Next to continue. Enter your Uyuni 2025.07 extension registration code. Click Next to continue. On the NTP Configuration page click Next. On the Authentication for the System page enter a password for the root user. Click Next. On the Installation Settings page click Install. This concludes installation of SL Micro 6.1 and Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension. If you added Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension during SL Micro 6.1 installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SL Micro 6.1 installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SL Micro 6.1 installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.07 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the Command Line List available extensions with the following command: transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install: If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> Reboot. Procedure: Updating the System Log in as root. Run transactional-update: transactional-update Reboot. SL Micro is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates. However, this behavior is not desirable for the Uyuni environment. To prevent automatic updates on your server, Uyuni disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process. If you prefer the SL Micro default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command: systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer","title":"","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"snippet-prepare-micro-host","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/snippet-prepare-micro-host.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They are designed to configure storage for Uyuni Server and Proxy. The scripts take disk devices as arguments. mgr-storage-proxy requires a single argument for the storage disk device. mgr-storage-server requires a storage disk device and can optionally accept a second argument for a dedicated database disk device. While both normal and database storage can reside on the same disk, it is advisable to place the database on a dedicated, high-performance disk to ensure better performance and easier management. Both mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy perform standard storage setup operations: Validate the provided storage devices. Ensure that devices are empty and suitable for use. Create XFS filesystems on the specified devices. Mount the devices temporarily for data migration. Move the relevant storage directories to the new devices. Create entries in /etc/fstab so that the storage mounts automatically on boot. Remount the devices at their final locations. Table 1. Additional tool-specific behavior mgr-storage-server Optionally supports a separate device for database storage. Stops SUSE Manager services during migration, restarts them afterward. Moves Podman volumes directory /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes to the prepared storage, and optionally /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql to the prepared database storage. mgr-storage-proxy Focuses only on proxy storage (no database storage support). Stops and restarts the proxy service during migration. Moves podman volumes directory /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes to the prepared storage. Both tools automate standard Linux storage operations. There is no hidden or custom logic beyond what a Linux administrator would do manually. They do not create or manage LVM volumes. They do not configure RAID or complex storage topologies. They do not prevent you from managing storage using normal Linux tools after setup. They do not provide dynamic resizing or expansion capabilities — these must be handled using standard Linux storage tools. Once storage has been configured, you can safely manage it using standard Linux commands. Listing 1. Example 1: Extending storage if using LVM lvextend -L +10G /dev/your_vg/your_lv xfs_growfs /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Example 2: Migrating to a larger disk Add and format the new disk. Mount it temporarily. Use rsync to copy data. Update /etc/fstab. Remount at the correct location. Always take a backup before making changes to your storage setup. Use these tools only during initial storage setup or when migrating to new storage where the tool is expected to handle data migration and update /etc/fstab. Do not rerun these scripts for resizing or expanding storage. Use standard Linux tools (e.g., lvextend, xfs_growfs) for such operations. mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy help automate the initial persistent storage setup for Uyuni components using standard Linux storage practices. They do not limit or interfere with standard storage management afterward. After setup, continue managing your storage using familiar Linux tools. A full database volume can cause significant issues with system operation. As disk usage notifications have not yet been adapted for containerized environments, users are encouraged to monitor the disk space used by Podman volumes themselves, either through tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, or any other preferred method.

From there, one can run the CLI tools as usual. The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help <topic>): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"451":{"id":451,"text":"When XMLRPC API is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1.

In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server.

However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey).

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/MLM. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"456":{"id":456,"text":"Hub online synchronization reuses the existing repository synchronization and synchronizes channels in the peripheral servers from the repositories on the hub server. When the connection between hub and peripheral server is established, the hub server becomes the main source of data for the peripheral server. In case of vendor channels, hub server is effectively replacing SUSE Customer Center. In case of custom channels, when they are synchronized, the peripheral server will fetch the packages from the hub and not from the original location of the custom channel defined on the hub. The main characteristics of this feature are: There can only be one hub server per connection, with one or more peripheral servers. Each peripheral server can only have one hub server. Content can be synchronized on regular basis, or on demand. Hub online synchronization is configured from menu Admin Hub Configuration. Configuration process uses token which uniquely identifies peripheral server’s connection to the hub. There are two ways to register a peripheral server to the hub server: by using a combination of token creation on the peripheral, and subsequent registration on the hub server. This method uses Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server and Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token. by direct registration from the hub, without any user interactions with the peripheral server. This method is described in Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server. In any case, if the peripheral host should be managed by the hub, you must first bootstrap the host as a minion to the hub before proceeding with the registration of the peripheral server. If the bootstrapping happens later, two systems are shown in the systems list. Before being registered to the hub server, a token needs to be generated on the peripheral server and passed to the administrator of the hub server. Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server On the peripheral server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Access Tokens. Click button Add token and select option Issue new token. In the field Server FQDN on the form that opens type the FQDN of the hub server that will be using this token. Click Issue. A new form with the successfully generated token appears and button Copy. The only time token is displayed is at the time of its creation. Save it in a safe place until it is later needed. Once generated, the token appears on the screen Access Tokens. The generated token needs to be transferred to the hub server before it can be used. Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token On the hub server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Existing token. In the field Token paste the token that was created on the peripheral server.

Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate to paste a certificate. Click button Register. A newly registered peripheral server will appear on screen Peripherals Configuration. It is possible to initiate the registration of a peripheral server from hub server, without any interaction with the peripheral server. Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server On the hub server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Administrator User/Password. In the fields Username and Password enter the credentials for the peripheral server. The credentials must be those of SUSE Manager Administrator of the peripheral server. In the field Root CA certificate specify the certificate using one of the options: Use option Not needed if both hub and peripheral servers have the same certificate authority. Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate in cases when PEM certificate is used. Click button Register. The newly registered peripheral server will be shown in the Systems System List with the value Foreign in the column System Type. To access its details, click on the peripheral server’s name and select tab Details Peripheral Server. Peripheral server uses hub to access the vendor channels and does not connect to the SUSE Customer Center directly. Therefore, if you open configured peripheral server’s page Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials, Admin Setup Wizard Products or Admin Setup Wizard PAYG Connections, you will see a notification that this is peripheral server and its connections are managed via hub. All existing tokens are shown in Admin Hub Configuration Access Tokens. A token can viewed as Consumed and Issued, both from the perspective of the peripheral and the hub server. From the perspective of the peripheral server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the peripheral server and received by the hub server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the hub server to be used by the peripheral server. From the perspective of the hub server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the hub server and received by the peripheral server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the peripheral server to be used by the hub server. A token can be invalidated, or deleted. Be careful when using option Invalidate as it no longer grants access to the other server. This operation ensures that no communication will happen until a new token is generated if the existing one is compromised, or until the current token is reactivated. Invalidated token can be made valid again at any time. It is possible to delete a token. Deleting is only possible when the server associated with the token is not registered as hub or peripheral. This operation cannot be undone. Every peripheral server stores the information about its hub server. A peripheral server can only have one hub server configured. Procedure: Accessing hub server details On the peripheral server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Hub Details. On the screen Hub Details find the information about the hub server. Field Hub server FQDN shows the hub server’s FQDN. Field Registration date shows the time when the peripheral server was registered to the hub server. Field Last modified shows the time of the last saved configuration change. Field Root Certificate Authority shows certificate details. To download, edit or delete the root certificate, clicking Download, Edit or Delete respectively. Deleting the certificate will break the connection between servers. Field GPG Public Key shows whether the GPG key has been configured for the hub server. For more information about GPG keys between hub and peripheral servers, see GPG key usage with hub online synchronization. Field Mirror credentials is the username the peripheral server uses when connecting to the hub server to synchronize vendor channels. This username is generated automatically on the hub server, and then transmitted to the peripheral server during the registration phase. When the metadata on the hub server are signed with a GPG key, the public key is automatically transmitted from hub to peripheral server. By default, Uyuni is not signing metadata. Therefore, when the peripheral server is downloading data from the hub server there is no way of checking if the downloaded metadata have a valid signature, unless the customer has created their own GPG key. To enable checking of the data integrity, the GPG key needs to be created on the hub. When the peripheral server is configured to communicate with the hub, the public GPG key will then automatically be transferred to it. When the GPG key is created on the hub, field GPG Public Key will be set to show that this server is using the GPG key. For more information about setting up own GPG key, see Repository Metadata.

The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. For more information about certificates, see Hub Deployment with XMLRPC. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Navigate to Help Report Database Schema to find the schema documentation. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

For more information on monitoring, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.","title":"Monitoring Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"monitoring","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/monitoring.html","titles":[]},"460":{"id":460,"text":"This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments. Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt Mine to check client availability. The Salt Mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. Since the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt Mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered clients will have the Salt Mine disabled by default. If the Salt Mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt Mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information, see Install Uyuni Proxy. Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use Uyuni for Retail to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Multi-Linux Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case.

More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation Depends on other settings, use /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/susemanager-connection-check to obtain a recommendation. Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Setting this value to very high values could cause opposite effect as the workers will compete to each other for the CPU resources and the performance could be dropped significantly. Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master could be a sign of too low or too high value of this parameter. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-32, depending on the number of the CPU cores available for the server, it is recommended to keep the value slightly less than the number of CPU cores. Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 16 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. It makes sense to monitor the salt-master stats event by enabling master_stats and adjusting master_stats_event_iter to fine tune the value of this parameter. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description Determines whether the master will fire authentication events. Authentication events are fired when a minion performs an authentication check with the master. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of salt/auth events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example auth_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#auth-events Description Determines whether the master will fire minion data cache events (minion/refresh/*). Minion data cache events are fired when a minion requests a minion data cache refresh. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of minion/refresh/* events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example minion_data_cache_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#minion-data-cache-events Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Description Determines whether the salt-broker service should wait for backend sockets to be connected before opening the sockets for listening for connections from salt-minions. When enabled, it helps to prevent collecting ZeroMQ messages with the internal buffers of the sockets and pushing them to the salt-master once connection is restored. Tune when Unstable connectivity between the Uyuni Proxy and the Uyuni Server. Value default False Value recommendation True Location /etc/salt/broker Example wait_for_backend: True More information Proxies Connectivity Description The tcp keepalive interval to set on TCP ports. This setting can be used to tune Salt connectivity issues in messy network environments with misbehaving firewalls. Tune when Unstable connectivity between managed clients and the Uyuni Proxy or the Uyuni Server. Value default True Value recommendation True Location /etc/venv-salt-minon/minion.d/tuning.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning.conf, depending on the minion type. Example tcp_keepalive: True After changing Check Minions Connectivity for more details to fine tune extra keepalive parameters. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/minion.html#tcp-keepalive, Minions Connectivity Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

PINT is available at pint.suse.com and provided as an API and command-line tool with the python3-susepubliccloudinfo package from the Public Cloud Module repository. To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command supportconfig. The command-line tool is provided by the package supportutils which is installed by default. Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate supportconfig plug-ins. When supportconfig is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. supportconfig plug-ins are stored in directory /usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/. The following procedure shows how to create a supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly. Procedure: Creating a supportconfig Archive Run supportconfig as root. Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list: Listing 1. Options: -E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E) Company name (-O) Your name (-N) Your phone number (-P) -i KEYWORDS, -F Limits the features to check.

Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP4/html/SLES-SAP-installation/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see General Requirements. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox.

You need to do some configuration to set up the Uyuni Web UI. In your browser, navigate to the URL of the server, and configure your administration access to the Web UI. Now you can use the Web UI to prepare software channels and activation keys for your clients. On the Uyuni Server, add the appropriate SAP channels: From the Web UI, add SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP. Synchronize the Uyuni Server with the SUSE Customer Center. You can do this using the Web UI. Add the new channel to your activation key. To check if a channel has finished synchronizing navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and select the Products tab. This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. Software channels can be very large. The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours. When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it. This gives you a backup of the original synchronization data.","title":"Prepare Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"prepare-server","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/qs-sap/prepare-server.html","titles":[]},"472":{"id":472,"text":"Salt commands have three main components: target, function, and arguments.

There are no common recommendations for all the possible use cases as the environments could be very different expecially if public clouds instances are involved. In case clients are losing the connection to the Uyuni Server (or Uyuni Proxy if involved), they are unreachable from the Uyuni Server Web UI or with command line tools. To understand such a connection issue check if the client is not reachable from the Uyuni Server with salt MINION_ID test.ping, while venv-salt-call test.ping (or salt-call test.ping if non-bundle Salt is used on the client) is working fine on the client side. If this is the case, it is recommended to set tcp_keepalive parameters. The parameters with the values from the example below can be used as a starting point to look for settings, which could prevent cases of connection loss without restoring for some environments. It is recommended to put the parameters in the separate drop-in configuration file like /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf, depending on the minion type used on the client side. Listing 1. Example: Keepalive Parameters Example Values ###### Keepalive settings ###### ############################################ # ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by # the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through # a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is # the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion # without informing either party that their connection has been taken away. # Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening. # Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False) # or leave to the OS defaults (-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled. tcp_keepalive: True # How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300 # to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (-1) is typically 7200 seconds # on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time. tcp_keepalive_idle: 10 # How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default -1 # to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes. tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3 # How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default -1 to # use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see # /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl. tcp_keepalive_intvl: 10 salt-broker service is used on Uyuni Proxies to forward Salt traffic between the Uyuni Server and salt-minion service used on the client side. It is possible that salt-broker and all the clients behind it could be affected with the same issue as the clients directly connected to the Uyuni Server. The issue could be fixed with the same parameters as recommended for the minions, but specified in /etc/salt/broker on each Uyuni Proxy. Uyuni Proxy connectivity can also suffer when the connectivity to the Uyuni Server is lost for a quite long interval. In such a case Proxy connected clients started to retry the authentication to the salt-master service on the Uyuni Server. This situation could be potentially dangerous because it could lead to collecting large amount of ZeroMQ messages with authentication attemps in the interal buffer of ZeroMQ sockets used inside the salt-broker service. Then, on restoring the connection to the salt-master all of the pending messages will be pushed to it. It could lead to the issues on Uyuni Server side with salt-master service, because it could be impossible to serve all the cached requests in appropriate time or even to the complete denial of the service. To avoid such situation a set of tuning parameters is available. As the most important one, wait_for_backend should be set to True. This prevents opening the sockets for the clients behind the proxy while the connectivity to the salt-master service is not established. In this case the messages from the clients are not collected in the internal buffers. drop_after_retries is setting the number of retries before closing the sockets to drop the cached messages. The other parameters could help to fine tune the behavior for the environment. Setting timeouts, intervals and drop_after_retries to lower values are making salt-broker service more aggressive on detecting the connection loss to the salt-master, so that it puts the clients behind the proxy to the conditions closer as they are connected directly to the Uyuni Server. Increasing the values could provide some benefits in case if the network channel between the Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni Server is not stable enough, the message buffering can provide some flexibility while re-establishing the connection.

Custom states are stored as Salt state files on the Uyuni Server with a .sls extension. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create and edit custom Salt state files. You must create a state channel first, with an initial state named init.sls. The init.sls file is used to reference all other state files within the channel. The custom states that you create using the Web UI are stored on the Uyuni Server in the the /srv/susemanager/salt/<organization>/ directory. After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state. If you want to reference file templates in this configuration channel, ensure your file starts by specifying the source of the managed file, using this syntax: file.managed: - source: salt://<org_name>/<channel_name>/etc/<ID>/<filename> Example custom state files are given later in this section. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. Procedure: Adding Additional Files to a Custom State Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. . Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit <filename>.sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2.

Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all user public files must be saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey-<key_id> deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls.

If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames.

The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN.

In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution.

You can write your own custom formulas, and make them available to client systems in the Uyuni Web UI. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directory also contains an optional metadata.yml file with additional information about the formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt/<custom-formula-name>/ Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/ All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a <field name>: null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/MLM_minion.py The process is executed like this: The MLM_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (MLM_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In addition to its role as a Prometheus exporter, Saline also provides the saline-formula, which simplifies configuration of Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, enhancing monitoring and visualization capabilities. To deploy Saline on the Uyuni Server use mgradm upgrade podman with --saline-replicas 1. Saline can be deployed during the installation of the Uyuni Server using mgradm install podman with --saline-replicas 1. The only possible values for --saline-replicas are 1 or 0. After finishing the deployment Uyuni-saline.service should be configured on the Uyuni Server host system. It is recommended to add master_stats: True and adjust the value of master_stats_event_iter: 60 if needed. Then restart salt-master to get the detailed statistics of internal Salt calls. This can be help with tuning large scale deployment installations. To configure Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, see Saline Formula. To remove Saline from the Uyuni Server use mgradm upgrade podman with --saline-replicas 0. The dashboard represents Salt events with the different views presented on the panels. The panel represents all the Salt events grouped by categories. Salt events represents the total number of all categories of the events. The panel provides the minions activity status for the specified interval of times. It shows the amount of minions which were active in last minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour or considered offline on this moment of time or even ever seen (could be targeted or either responded or not) or active. The panel provides the detailed representation of Salt Events with the event spread by direction The events which are send to the minions are presented on the positive side of the axis, while the events received from the minions are presented on the negative side. The panel represents states apply process events grouped by the status: succeeded, failed, causing errors or applied in the test mode. The panel represents the number of internal calls grouped by function, which are exposed with Salt stats. The panel represents the average duration of internal calls grouped by function, which are exposed with Salt stats. The dashboard represents Salt state apply process, it can be used for detailed monitoring of the internals of state apply process initiated for a number of targets. The panel represents an instant view of the state functions calls represented in the table view. The panel provides the table of state functions calls with the detailed profiling data that can be used for state optimization.","title":"Monitoring Salt Events","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-monitoring","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-monitoring.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.

SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: <USER> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://MLM-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the MLM-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost MLM-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to MLM-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:MLM-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to MLM-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file=<temporary_bootstrap_roster> minion state.apply certs,<bootstrap_state>` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time. The SSH key is used on salt-ssh managed systems. Additionally, it is used on Uyuni Proxies for the user mgrsshtunnel. Normal systems managed with the Salt default method are not affected and do not have this key configured. Procedure: Rotating SSH keys On the Uyuni Server, as user root, change to user salt: su -s /bin/bash - salt Create a new SSH key: ssh-keygen -N \"\" -t rsa -q -f /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id Copy the public key into the Salt filesystem to make it usable in a Salt state: cp /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id.pub /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ Change back to user root again: exit Rollout the new key to all systems that need it. Applying the util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key state will limit the changes to salt-ssh managed systems and proxies: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key Move the old key away and make the new key the standard key. Rename mgr_ssh_id key to disabled_mgr_ssh_id and new_mgr_ssh_id key to mgr_ssh_id in the SSH keystore of the user salt as well as in the Salt filesystem for the public keys: su -s /bin/bash - salt cd .ssh mv mgr_ssh_id disabled_mgr_ssh_id mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id mgr_ssh_id mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub cd /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub OPTIONAL: When containerized proxies exist, re-create the configuration to get the new SSH key into the proxy configuration. Restart the containers with the new configuration. It is also possible to change the existing configuration on the podman host (ssh.yaml). Change the value of server_ssh_key_pub with the content of the current mgr_ssh_id.pub. To remove the disabled keys from the authorized_keys` files of the [literal]salt-ssh`` managed systems and the proxies, apply the state a second time: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see Custom System Information. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. If you change pillar data on the server (Salt master) the actual pillar data on the client (minion) is updated only after calling saltutil.refresh_pillar for the client. Otherwise it could happen that pillar.items and pillar.get calls would produce different results with different values of pillars that were not refreshed. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are sometimes referred to as Salt clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step. For more information on states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html. For more Salt terminology, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/glossary.html.","title":"Terminology","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-terminology","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-terminology.html","titles":[]},"502":{"id":502,"text":"Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A Salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (java.salt_presence_ping_timeout/java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here. Uyuni defines a timeout for SSH connections in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: # salt_ssh_connect_timeout = 180","title":"Salt timeouts","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-timeouts","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-timeouts.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Multi-Linux Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp://<server-address>/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It assumes that the proxy host system has already been bootstrapped, is subscribed to the base operating system channel (such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 or SL Micro 6.1) and to the Proxy Extension channel. For information about client onboarding, see Client Registration. Before starting the conversion, ensure the following requirements are fulfilled. Only the following operating systems are currently supported for proxy conversion: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 SL Micro 6.1 Already onboarded in Uyuni Reachable via the network Subscribed to the appropriate proxy extension channel: Uyuni Proxy Extension 5.1 (matching architecture) Before proceeding with the proxy conversion, make sure the following preparations are completed to avoid interruptions during the conversion process. Valid SSL certificates are required to secure communication between the proxy and other components. You need: The public certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the certificate on the Uyuni server A certificate for the proxy. The corresponding private key for the proxy certificate. If your CA uses an intermediate certificate chain, you must include all intermediate certificates as well. If you are not using third party certificates, you can generate them using the rhn-ssl-tool inside the Uyuni container.

This guide presumes you have already successfully deployed a Uyuni 2025.07 Server. SL Micro is only supported as regular minion (default contact method) for the time being. We are working on managing it as Salt SSH client (salt-ssh contact method), too. To successfully deploy, you will perform the following actions: Procedure: Deploying Proxy Review hardware requirements. Synchronize the SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 parent channel and the proxy extension child channel on the server. Install SL Micro or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on a bare-metal machine. During the installation, register SL Micro or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server along with the Uyuni Proxy extension. Create a Salt activation key. Bootstrap the proxy as a client with the default connection method. Generate a proxy configuration. Transfer the proxy configuration from server to proxy. Use the proxy configuration to register the client as a proxy with Uyuni. Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host The supported operating system for the container host are SL Micro 6.1 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Container host A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. For more information about hardware requirements for deploying Uyuni Proxy, see installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#proxy-hardware-requirements. This section presumes that you have already entered your organization credentials under the Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials in the server’s Web UI. Products are listed on the Admin Setup Wizard Products page. This channel must be fully synchronized on the server, with the child channel Proxy as an extension option selected. Procedure: Synchronizing the Parent Channel and Proxy Extension In the Uyuni Web UI select Admin Products. From the products page enter SL Micro or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server in the filter field. Next use the drop-down to select the required architecture. For this example x86-64. In the Product Description field select the SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 checkbox then use the drop-down to select the Uyuni Proxy Extension 5.1 x86_64 extension. Click the Add products button. Wait for the synchronization to complete. In the following subsections, you either prepare the proxy host with SLE Micro or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Procedure: Downloading the Installation Media Locate the SL Micro 6.1 installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/, and download the appropriate media file. Prepare a DVD or USB flash drive with the downloaded .iso image for installation. For more information about preparing your machines (virtual or physical), see the SL Micro Deployment Guide. Procedure: Installing SL Micro 6.1 Insert the DVD or USB flash drive (USB disk or key) containing the installation image for SLE Micro 6.1. Boot or reboot your system. Use the arrow keys to select Installation. Adjust Keyboard and language. Click the checkbox to accept the license agreement. Click Next to continue. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. The Uyuni 2025.07 containers are installed as extensions. Depending on the specific extension needed from the list below, additional SUSE Customer Center registration codes will be required for each. Uyuni 2025.07 Server Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy Uyuni 2025.07 Retail Branch Server The SL Micro 6.1 entitlement is included within the Uyuni entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code. Enter your SUSE Customer Center email address. Enter your registration code for SL Micro 6.1. Click Next to continue. To install a proxy, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy extension; to install a server, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Server extension Checkbox. Click Next to continue. Enter your Uyuni 2025.07 extension registration code. Click Next to continue. On the NTP Configuration page click Next. On the Authentication for the System page enter a password for the root user. Click Next. On the Installation Settings page click Install. This concludes installation of SL Micro 6.1 and Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension. If you added Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension during SL Micro 6.1 installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SL Micro 6.1 installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SL Micro 6.1 installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.07 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the Command Line List available extensions with the following command: transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install: If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> Reboot. Procedure: Updating the System Log in as root. Run transactional-update: transactional-update Reboot. SL Micro is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates. However, this behavior is not desirable for the Uyuni environment. To prevent automatic updates on your server, Uyuni disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process. If you prefer the SL Micro default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command: systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer To continue with deployment, see Configure Custom Persistent Storage. Alternatively, you can deploy Uyuni on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. The following procedure describes the main steps of the installation process. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Extensions on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 Locate and download SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 .iso at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/. Make sure that you have regsistration codes both for the host operating system (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7) and extensions Start the installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. On the Language, keyboard and product selection select the product to install. On the License agreement read the agreement and check I Agree to the License Terms. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. Enter your SUSE Customer Center email address. Enter your registration code for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Click Next to continue. Please note that for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7, you are required to have a valid SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscription and corresponding registration code, which you must provide on this screen. You will be required to enter the Uyuni Extension registration code below. In the screen Extensions and Modules Selection check the following: Select the Uyuni Server Extension to install the Server, or the Uyuni Proxy Extension to install the Proxy. Basesystem Module Containers Module Click Next to continue. Enter your Uyuni 2025.07 extension registration code. Click Next to continue. Complete the installation. When the installation completes, log in to the newly installed server as root. Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install): zypper up Reboot. Log in as root and install podman plus mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service To continue with deployment, see Configure Custom Persistent Storage. Configuring persistent storage is optional, but it is the only way to avoid serious trouble with container full disk conditions. If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-proxy tool. For more information, see mgr-storage-proxy --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and Squid cache volumes. Use the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-proxy <storage-disk-device> For example: mgr-storage-proxy /dev/nvme1n1 This command will create the persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes Troubleshooting Container with Full Disk Event Procedure: Creating an Activation Key Navigate to Systems Activation Keys , and click Create key. Create an activation key for the proxy host with SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 as the parent channel. This key should include all recommended channels and the proxy as an extension child channel. Proceed to boostrapping the proxy host as a default client. Procedure: Bootstrapping the Proxy Host Select Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the fields for your proxy host. Select the activation key created in the previous step from the drop-down. Click Bootstrap. Wait for the bootstrap process to complete successfully. Check the Salt menu and confirm the Salt key is listed and accepted. Reboot the proxy host if the operating system is SL Micro. Select the host from the System list and trigger a second reboot in case of SL Micro after all events are finished to conclude the onboarding. Procedure: Updating the Proxy Host Select the host from the Systems list and apply all patches to update it. Reboot the proxy host if the operating system is SL Micro. The configuration archive of the Uyuni Proxy is generated by the Uyuni Server. Each additional Proxy requires its own configuration archive. For Podman deployment, the container host for the Uyuni Proxy must be registered as a client to the Uyuni Server prior to generating this proxy configuration. If a proxy FQDN is used to generate a proxy container configuration that is not a registered client (as in the Kubernetes use case), a new system entry will appear in system list. This new entry will be shown under previously entered Proxy FQDN value and will be of Foreign system type. Procedure: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration Using Web UI In the Web UI, navigate to Systems Proxy Configuration and fill the required data: In the Proxy FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy. In the Parent FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the Uyuni Server or another Uyuni Proxy. In the Proxy SSH port field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on Uyuni Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022. In the Max Squid cache size [MB] field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Recommended is to use at most 80% of available storage for the containers. 2 GB represents the default proxy squid cache size. This will need to be adjusted for your environment. In the SSL certificate selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for Uyuni Proxy or an existing one should be used. You can consider generated certificates as Uyuni builtin (self signed) certificates. Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate. The CA certificates generated by the server are stored in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/_data/ssl-build directory. For more information about existing or custom certificates and the concept of corporate and intermediate certificates, see Import SSL Certificates. Click Generate to register a new proxy FQDN in the Uyuni Server and generate a configuration archive (config.tar.gz) containing details for the container host. After a few moments you are presented with file to download. Save this file locally. You can generate a Proxy configuration using spacecmd. Procedure: Generating Proxy Configuration with spacecmd and Self-Signed Certificate SSH into your container host. Execute the following command replacing the Server and Proxy FQDN: mgrctl exec -ti 'spacecmd proxy_container_config_generate_cert -- dev-pxy.example.com dev-srv.example.com 2048 email@example.com -o /tmp/config.tar.gz' Copy the generated configuration from the server container: mgrctl cp server:/tmp/config.tar.gz . You can generate a Proxy configuration using spacecmd for a custom certificates rather than the default self-signed certificates. Procedure: Generating Proxy Configuration with spacecmd and Custom Certificate SSH into your Server container host. Execute the following command replacing the Server and Proxy FQDN: for f in ca.crt proxy.crt proxy.key; do mgrctl cp $f server:/tmp/$f done mgrctl exec -ti 'spacecmd proxy_container_config -- -p 8022 pxy.example.com srv.example.com 2048 email@example.com /tmp/ca.crt /tmp/proxy.crt /tmp/proxy.key -o /tmp/config.tar.gz' Copy the generated configuration from the server container: mgrctl cp server:/tmp/config.tar.gz . The Web UI generates a configuration archive. This archive needs to be made available on the proxy container host. Procedure: Copying the Proxy Configuration If not already done, copy the configuration archive (config.tar.gz) generated in the previous step from the server container to the server host: mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz . If not already done, copy the files from the server host to the proxy host: scp config.tar.gz <proxy-FQDN>:/root On the proxy host, install the Proxy with: mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz Container can now be started with the mgrpxy command: Procedure: Starting and Checking Proxy Status Start the proxy by calling: mgrpxy start Check container status by calling: mgrpxy status Five Uyuni Proxy containers should be present and should be part of the proxy-pod container pod: proxy-salt-broker proxy-httpd proxy-tftpd proxy-squid proxy-ssh By default, the Uyuni Proxy suite is configured to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services. However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with -tag and -image. For example: mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds is the image to use and 0.1.0 is the version tag, before restarting it. To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters: mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.","title":"Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy Deployment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"proxy-deployment-mlm","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/proxy-deployment-mlm.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The mgrpxy and helm packages are available in the Uyuni Proxy product repositories. To install it, run: transactional-update pkg install helm mgrpxy Reboot Procedure: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration Using Web UI In the Web UI, navigate to Systems Proxy Configuration and fill the required data: In the Proxy FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy. In the Parent FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the Uyuni Server or another Uyuni Proxy. In the Proxy SSH port field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on Uyuni Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022. In the Max Squid cache size [MB] field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Recommended is to use at most 80% of available storage for the containers. 2 GB represents the default proxy squid cache size. This will need to be adjusted for your environment. In the SSL certificate selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for Uyuni Proxy or an existing one should be used. You can consider generated certificates as Uyuni builtin (self signed) certificates. Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate. The CA certificates generated by the server are stored in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/_data/ssl-build directory. For more information about existing or custom certificates and the concept of corporate and intermediate certificates, see Import SSL Certificates. Click Generate to register a new proxy FQDN in the Uyuni Server and generate a configuration archive (config.tar.gz) containing details for the container host. After a few moments you are presented with file to download. Save this file locally. You can generate a Proxy configuration using spacecmd.

This type of deployment is commonly used in high-security environments such as military installations, financial systems, critical infrastructure, and anywhere sensitive data is handled and must be protected from external threats. Uyuni supports two deployment variants. The recommended installation method is using the provided Uyuni Virtual Machine Image option, since all the needed tools and container images are pre-loaded and will work out of the box. For more information about installing Uyuni Server Virtual Machine, see Deploy Server as a Virtual Machine. To upgrade Uyuni Server, users should upgrade all packages in the system and follow the procedures defined in Server Upgrade. Uyuni also provides all the needed container images in RPM’s that can be installed on the system. User should make the needed RPM available on the internal network. That can be done by using a second Uyuni Server or an RMT server. Procedure: Install Uyuni on SL Micro in Air-gapped Install SL Micro Update the system Install tools packages and image packages (replace $ARCH$ with the correct architecture) transactional-update pkg install mgradm* mgrctl* multi-linux-manager-5.1-$ARCH$-server-* Reboot. Deploy Uyuni with mgradm. For more detailed information about installing Uyuni Server on SL Micro, see Deploy Server as a Virtual Machine. To upgrade Uyuni Server, users should upgrade all packages in the system and follow the procedures defined in Server Upgrade. The PTF images are not available as packages. This means that they should be pulled using podman on a machine with internet access, then saved in an archive, transferred to the air-gapped machine and loaded there. Procedure: Pulling the image on a machine with internet access Install podman. Authenticate against the SUSE Registry using the SCC credentials: set +o history echo SCC_MIRRORING_PASSWORD | podman login -u \"SCC_MIRRORING_USER\" --password-stdin registry.suse.com set -o history Create a /tmp/ptf-images temporary file with the URL of the PTF images, one per line. In most of the cases only the server image is needed and it can be created with a command like the following, after replacing the SCC_USERID and PTFID values. SCC_USERID=aXXXX PTFID=12345 echo \"registry.suse.com/a/$SCC_USERID/$PTFID/suse/multi-linux-manager/5.1/x86_64/server:latest-ptf-$PTFID\" >>/tmp/ptf-images Pull each of the container images of the PTF and save them in a tar archive. for image in `cat /tmp/ptf-images`; do podman pull $image done podman save -o /tmp/ptf-images.tar `cat /tmp/ptf-images` Transfer the /tmp/ptf-images.tar images archive on the server to patch. Procedure: Loading the images on the server to patch Ensure the ptf-images.tar file is available on the server. Load the images from the archive: podman load -i ptf-images.tar Install the PTF using mgradm support ptf podman as would be done on a connected machine.

This table shows the software and hardware requirements for deploying Uyuni Server on your bare metal machine. For the purposes of this guide your machine should have 16 GB of RAM, and at least 200 GB of disk space. For background information about disk space, see Hardware Requirements. Table 1. Software and Hardware Requirements Software and Hardware Recommended Operating System SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 Architecture x86-64, ARM, s390x, ppc64le Processor (CPU) Minimum of four (4) 64-bit CPU cores RAM 16 GB Disk Space 200 GB Channel Requirements 50 GB per SUSE or openSUSE product 360 GB per Red Hat product Swap space: 8 to 12 GB Supported operating system for the Server Container Host The supported operating system for the container host is SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Container host A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully. An FQDN typically follows the format <host>.<domain>.com. For instance: mlm.example.com mlm.container.lab For more information, see the section on network requirements in Network Requirements. Uyuni 2025.07 defines the required persistent storage volumes by default. These are created during installation by the mgradm tool if they do not already exist. These volumes are created in /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/, where Podman stores its volumes by default. Recommendations You can leverage the simplicity of storage by mounting an external storage device to this directory. Because it will store the PostgreSQL database, binary packages for repositories, caches, operating system images, autoinstallation distributions, and configuration files, we have three recommendations: Fast Storage This mount point should ideally be NVMe or SSD-class devices. Slower storage will adversely affect Uyuni performance. Large Capacity Recommended minimum size for this is at least 300 GB, and larger if there will be multiple Linux distributions or architectures to manage. Recommended Filesystem XFS (though any supported filesystem for SL Micro 6.1 could work). Optional You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on the expected volume path inside it such as /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk. This adds to the complexity of a Uyuni deployment, and may affect the resilience the default storage recommendation provides. For a list of all persistent volumes in the container, see Persistent Container Volumes. You can deploy Uyuni on SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. SL Micro is a transactional system, while SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is a full server operating system. Depending on your decision, either continue with Prepare SL Micro 6.1 Host or with Prepare SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 Host and skip the not selected section. Procedure: Downloading the Installation Media Locate the SL Micro 6.1 installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/, and download the appropriate media file. Prepare a DVD or USB flash drive with the downloaded .iso image for installation. For more information about preparing your machines (virtual or physical), see the SL Micro Deployment Guide. Procedure: Installing SL Micro 6.1 Insert the DVD or USB flash drive (USB disk or key) containing the installation image for SLE Micro 6.1. Boot or reboot your system. Use the arrow keys to select Installation. Adjust Keyboard and language. Click the checkbox to accept the license agreement. Click Next to continue. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. The Uyuni 2025.07 containers are installed as extensions. Depending on the specific extension needed from the list below, additional SUSE Customer Center registration codes will be required for each. Uyuni 2025.07 Server Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy Uyuni 2025.07 Retail Branch Server The SL Micro 6.1 entitlement is included within the Uyuni entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code. Enter your SUSE Customer Center email address. Enter your registration code for SL Micro 6.1. Click Next to continue. To install a proxy, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy extension; to install a server, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Server extension Checkbox. Click Next to continue. Enter your Uyuni 2025.07 extension registration code. Click Next to continue. On the NTP Configuration page click Next. On the Authentication for the System page enter a password for the root user. Click Next. On the Installation Settings page click Install. This concludes installation of SL Micro 6.1 and Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension. If you added Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension during SL Micro 6.1 installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SL Micro 6.1 installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SL Micro 6.1 installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.07 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the Command Line List available extensions with the following command: transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install: If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> Reboot. Procedure: Updating the System Log in as root. Run transactional-update: transactional-update Reboot. SL Micro is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates. However, this behavior is not desirable for the Uyuni environment. To prevent automatic updates on your server, Uyuni disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process. If you prefer the SL Micro default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command: systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer To continue with deployment, see Configure Custom Persistent Storage. Alternatively, you can deploy Uyuni on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. The following procedure describes the main steps of the installation process. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Extensions on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 Locate and download SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 .iso at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/. Make sure that you have regsistration codes both for the host operating system (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7) and extensions Start the installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. On the Language, keyboard and product selection select the product to install. On the License agreement read the agreement and check I Agree to the License Terms. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. Enter your SUSE Customer Center email address. Enter your registration code for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Click Next to continue. Please note that for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7, you are required to have a valid SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscription and corresponding registration code, which you must provide on this screen. You will be required to enter the Uyuni Extension registration code below. In the screen Extensions and Modules Selection check the following: Select the Uyuni Server Extension to install the Server, or the Uyuni Proxy Extension to install the Proxy. Basesystem Module Containers Module Click Next to continue. Enter your Uyuni 2025.07 extension registration code. Click Next to continue. Complete the installation. When the installation completes, log in to the newly installed server as root. Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install): zypper up Reboot. Log in as root and install podman plus mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service To continue with deployment, see Configure Custom Persistent Storage. Configuring persistent storage is optional, but it is the only way to avoid serious trouble with container full disk conditions. It is highly recommended to configure custom persistent storage with the mgr-storage-server tool. For more information, see mgr-storage-server --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes. Use the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] For example: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 This command will create the persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes Troubleshooting Container with Full Disk Event If you want to use third-party SSL certificates instead of the self-signed certificates, import them in the run of the following deployment procedure. For more information about the requirements of third-party SSL certificates, see Import SSL Certificates. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. For example: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. Procedure: Deploying Uyuni 2025.07 Using mgradm Log in as root. Execute one of the following commands, depending on the SSL certificate variant (self-signed or third-party). Replace <FQDN> with your fully qualified domain name of the Uyuni Server: Using self-signed certificates provided by Uyuni: mgradm install podman <FQDN> With importing SSL certificates using third-party SSL certificate flags (the example can adjusted if not all these certificates are needed): mgradm install podman <FQDN> \\ --ssl-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-server-cert <string> \\ --ssl-server-key <string> \\ --ssl-db-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-db-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-db-cert <string> \\ --ssl-db-key <string> For more information, see mgradm install podman --help. If the executed command fails ensure that you have registered Uyuni 2025.07. If you skipped registration during installation and now need to register from the command line, follow the steps below to log in to the registry: podman login -u <EMAIL> -p <REGISTRATION-CODE> registry.suse.com Use the Uyuni 2025.07 registration key when prompted. Enter CA key (certificate authority) and administrator account password when prompted. The administrator account password must be at least 5 characters and less than 48 characters in length. Press Enter. Enter the email address of the administration account. Press Enter. Wait for deployment to complete. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN. Enter your username (default is admin) and the password you set during the deployment process. In this guide you deployed Uyuni 2025.07 Server as a container. Proceed to the next section to add your organization credentials for syncing with SUSE Customer Center. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN. Enter your username (default is admin) and the password you set during the deployment process. In the Uyuni Web UI, select Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Point your browser to the SUSE Customer Center. Select your organization from the left navigation. Select the users tab from the top of the page then Organization Credentials. Make a note of your Mirroring credentials. Back in the Uyuni Web UI enter your Username and Password, and confirm with Save. When the credentials are confirmed with a green check-mark icon, proceed with Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center. Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. If you recently registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will begin populating the table. This operation could take up to a few minutes. You can monitor the progress of the operation in section on the right Refresh the product catalog from SUSE Customer Center. The table of products lists architecture, channels, and status information. For more information, see Wizard. Use the Filter by product description and Filter by architecture to filter the list of displayed products. The channels listed on the Products page provide repositories for clients. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products at the top of the page to start product synchronization. After adding the channel, Uyuni will schedule the channel to be synchronized. This can take a long time as Uyuni will copy channel software sources from the SUSE repositories located at SUSE Customer Center to the local /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/ directory of your server. When the channel is fully synchronized, a bootstrap repository for it will be automatically generated. This step is crucial for successfully bootstrapping clients, ensuring that the channel synchronization and distribution are operational on the client side. This completes the installation and configuration of Uyuni, along with preparing the channels necessary for bootstrapping clients. When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can proceed with registering the Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy or additional clients. For more instructions, see Client Registration.

Procedure: Creating the VMware Virtual Machine Download Uyuni Server .vmdk file then transfer a copy to your VMware storage. Make a copy of uploaded .vmdk file using VMware web interface. This will convert provided .vmdk file to the format suitable for vSphere hypervisor. Create and name a new virtual machine based on the Guest OS Family Linux and Guest OS Version SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (64-bit). + Add an additional Hard Disk 2 of 500 GB (or more). Configure RAM and number of CPUs with minimum values. *) Set the network adapter as required. Power on the VM, and follow firstboot dialogs (keyboard layout, license agreement, time zone, password for root). When installation completes log in as root. Proceed to the next section. *) For minimum values, see installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#proxy-hardware-requirements. Before starting obtain your Uyuni Registration Code from SUSE Customer Center - https://scc.suse.com. The SL Micro 6.1 entitlement is included within the Uyuni entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. For example: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. Procedure: Registering SL Micro and Uyuni 2025.07 Boot the virtual machine. Log in as root. Register SL Micro with SCC. transactional-update register -r <REGCODE> -e <your_email> Reboot. Register Uyuni 2025.07 with SUSE Customer Center. transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <REGCODE> Reboot Update the system: transactional-update If updates were applied reboot. This step is optional. However, if custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-server tool. For more information, see mgr-storage-server --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes. Use the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] For example: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 This command will create the persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes Troubleshooting Container with Full Disk Event Execute one of the following commands, depending on the SSL certificate variant (self-signed or third-party). Replace <FQDN> with your fully qualified domain name of the Uyuni Server: Using self-signed certificates provided by Uyuni: mgradm install podman <FQDN> With importing SSL certificates using third-party SSL certificate flags (the example can adjusted if not all these certificates are needed): mgradm install podman <FQDN> \\ --ssl-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-server-cert <string> \\ --ssl-server-key <string> \\ --ssl-db-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-db-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-db-cert <string> \\ --ssl-db-key <string> For more information, see mgradm install podman --help.","title":"Uyuni 2025.07 Server Deployment as a Virtual Machine - VMware","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"server-deployment-vmdk-mlm","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-vmdk-mlm.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In the context of this migration, the legacy Uyuni Server (RPM installation) is sometimes also called old server. Neither in-place migration is not possible nor allows the migration procedure currently any hostname renaming functionality. Thus the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the new server will remain identical to that on the legacy server. After migration, it is necessary to update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. For more information, see Finalize migration. Self trusted GPG keys are not migrated. GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated. Thus synchronizing channels with spacewalk-repo-sync can fail. The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the legacy Uyuni installation to the container host after the actual server migration. Procedure: Manual Migration of the GPG Keys to New Server Copy the keys from the legacy Uyuni server to the container host of the new server. Later, add each key to the migrated server with the command mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE>. The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the legacy server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration the processes on the legacy server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping the services on the legacy server. For example: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare Procedure: Initial Preparation on the Legacy Server Stop the Uyuni services: spacewalk-service stop Stop the PostgreSQL service: systemctl stop postgresql Procedure: Preparing the SSH connection Ensure that for root an SSH key exists on the new 2025.07 server. If a key does not exist, create it with the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server host for a connection to the legacy server that does not prompt for a password. eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add To establish a connection without prompting for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server. If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add followed by the path to the private key. You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. Copy the public SSH key to the legacy Uyuni Server (<oldserver.fqdn>) with ssh-copy-id. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: ssh-copy-id <oldserver.fqdn> The SSH key will be copied into the legacy server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. For more information, see the ssh-copy-id manpage. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the legacy Uyuni Server to check that no password is needed. Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint. In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Then try again. The fingerprint will be stored in the local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. When planning your migration from a legacy Uyuni to a containerized Uyuni, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the legacy setup. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. For example: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. Configuring persistent storage is optional, but it is the only way to avoid serious trouble with container full disk conditions. It is highly recommended to configure custom persistent storage with the mgr-storage-server tool. For more information, see mgr-storage-server --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes. Use the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] Devices must not have any filesystem. The command aborts if a filesystem exists on the storage device. For example: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 This command will create the persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes Troubleshooting Container with Full Disk Event Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> Migrate trusted SSL CA certificates. Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on a legacy Uyuni in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the legacy installation after migration: Procedure: Migrating the Certificates Copy the file from the legacy server to the new server. For example, as /local/ca.file. Copy the file into the container with the command: mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server. To redirect them to the new 2025.07 server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as the legacy server. If something goes wrong with the migration it is possible to restart the old system. As root, restart PostgreSQL and the spacewalk services with the following commands: service postgresql start spacewalk-service start Before executing the migration with mgradm migrate command, it is essential to predefine Persistent Volumes, especially considering that the migration job initiates the container from scratch. For more information, see the installation section on preparing these volumes in Persistent Container Volumes. Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server, replacing <oldserver.fqdn> with the appropriate FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> or mgradm migrate kubernetes <oldserver.fqdn> After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server. To redirect them to the new server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as the legacy server.","title":"Legacy Uyuni Server Migration to Container","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"migrate-uyuni-to-a-container","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/migrate-uyuni-to-a-container.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Procedure Generate Uyuni Proxy configuration archive file Transfer configuration archive to the container host prepared in installation step and extract it Start the proxy sevices with mgrpxy The configuration archive of the Uyuni Proxy is generated by the Uyuni Server. Each additional Proxy requires its own configuration archive. For Podman deployment, the container host for the Uyuni Proxy must be registered as a client to the Uyuni Server prior to generating this proxy configuration. If a proxy FQDN is used to generate a proxy container configuration that is not a registered client (as in the Kubernetes use case), a new system entry will appear in system list. This new entry will be shown under previously entered Proxy FQDN value and will be of Foreign system type. Procedure: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration Using Web UI In the Web UI, navigate to Systems Proxy Configuration and fill the required data: In the Proxy FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy. In the Parent FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the Uyuni Server or another Uyuni Proxy. In the Proxy SSH port field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on Uyuni Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022. In the Max Squid cache size [MB] field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Recommended is to use at most 80% of available storage for the containers. 2 GB represents the default proxy squid cache size. This will need to be adjusted for your environment. In the SSL certificate selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for Uyuni Proxy or an existing one should be used. You can consider generated certificates as Uyuni builtin (self signed) certificates. Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate. The CA certificates generated by the server are stored in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/_data/ssl-build directory.

Before starting the conversion, ensure the following requirements are fulfilled. Already onboarded in Uyuni Reachable via the network Before proceeding with the proxy conversion, make sure the following preparations are completed to avoid interruptions during the conversion process. Valid SSL certificates are required to secure communication between the proxy and other components. You need: The public certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the certificate on the Uyuni server A certificate for the proxy. The corresponding private key for the proxy certificate. If your CA uses an intermediate certificate chain, you must include all intermediate certificates as well.

Bootstrap the Proxy as a Salt minion. Generate a Proxy configuration. Transfer the Proxy configuration from Server to Proxy Use the Proxy configuration to register the Salt minion as a Proxy with Uyuni. Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host The supported operating system for the container host is openSUSE Leap Micro 6.1. Container host A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. This table shows the hardware requirements for deploying Uyuni Proxy. Table 1. Proxy Hardware Requirements Hardware Details Recommendation CPU x86-64, ARM Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores RAM Minimum 2 GB Recommended 8 GB Disk Space / (root directory) Minimum 40 GB /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Minimum 100 GB, Storage requirements should be calculated for the number of ISO distribution images, containers, and bootstrap repositories you will use. For general requirements, see General requirements. An openSUSE Leap Micro 6.1 server should be installed from installation media. This procedure is described below. For CPU, RAM, and storage requirements, see Hardware requirements. To guarantee that clients can resolve the FQDN domain name, both the containerized server and the host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups.

For managing the containerized proxy, use the mgrpxy tool. This section will help you migrate from the legacy systemd proxy using the mgrpxy tool. An in-place migration from previous releases of Uyuni to 2025.07 will remain unsupported due to the HostOS change from openSUSE Leap to openSUSE Leap Micro. The traditional contact protocol is no longer supported in Uyuni 2025.07 and later. Before migrating from previous Uyuni releases to 2025.07, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt. Procedure: Generate the Proxy Configuration Log in to the Uyuni Server Web UI. Select Systems Proxy Configuration from the left navigation. Enter your Proxy FQDN. Use the same FQDN as the original proxy host. Enter your Server FQDN. Enter the Proxy port number. We recommend using the default port of 8022.

This type of deployment is commonly used in high-security environments such as military installations, financial systems, critical infrastructure, and anywhere sensitive data is handled and must be protected from external threats. You can easily deploy container images using Podman, Docker, or Skopeo on a machine with internet access. Procedure Pull the desired image, then save the image as a tar archive. For example: Listing 1. Podman podman pull registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest podman save --output server.tar registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest Listing 2. Docker docker pull registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest docker save --output server.tar registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest Listing 3.

The process encompasses the installation of Podman, Uyuni container utilities, deployment, and then initiating interaction with the container through mgrctl. This section assumes you have already configured an openSUSE Leap Micro 6.1 host server, whether it is running on a physical machine or within a virtual environment. https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap-micro/ For general requirements, see General requirements. An openSUSE Leap Micro 6.1 server should be installed from installation media. https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap-micro/ This procedure is described below. For CPU, RAM, and storage requirements, see Hardware requirements. To guarantee that clients can resolve the FQDN domain name, both the containerized server and the host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on openSUSE Leap Micro 6.1 On your local host open a terminal window or start up a virtual machine running openSUSE Leap Micro 6.1. Log in. Enter the transactional-update shell: transactional-update shell Add the following repository to your openSUSE Leap Micro 6.1 server: zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-$(arch)-Media1/ uyuni-server-stable Refresh the repository list and accept the key: zypper ref Install the container tools: zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion uyuni-storage-setup-server Exit the transactional shell: transactional update # exit Reboot the host. For more information on the Uyuni Container Utilities, see Uyuni Container Utilities. This step is optional. However, if custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-server tool. For more information, see mgr-storage-server --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes. Use the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] For example: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 This command will create the persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes. Uyuni is deployed as a container using the mgradm tool. There are two methods of deploying a Uyuni server as a container. In this section we will focus on basic container deployment. For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy, see Custom YAML Configuration and Deployment with mgradm. For additional information, you can explore further by running mgradm --help from the command line. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. For example: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman From the terminal run the following command as the sudo user or as root. sudo mgradm install podman You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step. INF Setting up uyuni network 9:58AM INF Enabling system service 9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error=\"open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied\" Wait for deployment to complete. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN. Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes. If you are just testing out Uyuni you do not need to specify these volumes. mgradm will setup the correct volumes by default. Specifying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments. By default podman stores its volumes in /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/. You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk. This is especially important for the database and package mirrors.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring-your-own-subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server or proxy. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in Public Cloud Requirements. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Server. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete the setup in the Uyuni Web UI. You must use the BYOS method. Start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launch a Uyuni Proxy instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Proxy BYOS images by searching for suse manager proxy. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in Public Cloud Requirements. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Proxy. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using SUSE setup tools. When you have completed Uyuni Proxy setup, you need to activate the public cloud module.","title":"Initial Setup","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"setup","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/byos/setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Once the existing subscription term ends, you can purchase Uyuni PAYG via the cloud provider marketplace and manage your instances with a Uyuni deployment that is billed via the cloud. Yes, the listing works independently from your existing BYOS Uyuni subscriptions. Please remember that support processes may be different for deployments using your existing BYOS subscription and those billed via the cloud and note that there is currently no process for migrating deployments between BYOS and PAYG versions. When purchasing Uyuni via the AWS & Azure Marketplaces, the billing is as follows: Billing is monthly and handled via cloud marketplace. Managed instances are recorded hourly. The peak usage total is recorded for the month. There is a monthly usage charge for each instance in the count. SLES for SAP Applications PAYG/on-demand instances, when purchased via the cloud marketplace, include Lifecycle Management(LCM) entitlements for Uyuni. The Uyuni PAYG billing engine recognizes the embedded LCM entitlements and does not include them in the count. This means there are no additional charges to manage these with the Uyuni PAYG listing. However, if Uyuni Monitoring is required for these instances, additional charges will apply for this feature. If using the Uyuni PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace, billing will commence from the time of deployment and when applicable client instances are on-boarded to Uyuni. There is the Uyuni BYOS listing in the cloud marketplace that can be used, a trial subscription key can be obtained via the SUSE Website. This deployment cannot be directly converted to allow billing via cloud marketplaces. To benefit from monthly billing via the cloud marketplace, Uyuni needs to be redeployed using the version from the PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace. Billing is based on the number of managed instances. Below are 3 examples of how the node count is calculated, check the table below for the detail. Static usage Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management, for 1 month with no additional managed clients added in the month. Bursting Model Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management for 3 weeks in the month, bursting to 30 managed instances for 1 week. Transient model A temporary deployment of Uyuni with 20 managed instances, for 2 weeks (336 hours) The total is calculated by counting number of active nodes (checked hourly). There is a monthly charge for each managed node under management in the billing cycle. Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated. Table 1. Usage calculations for different scenarios Managed Instances Peak Usage Billed for Static Usage 10 10 10 Bursting Model 10 - 3 Weeks, 30 - 1 Week 30 30 Transient Cluster 20 - 2 Weeks 20 20 It is dependent on the deployment and the cloud provider, as every Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has its own commercial terms and offers. It may be possible to secure special commercial terms such as an annual subscription. For example, AWS can offer Uyuni PAYG via a Private Offer. Please contact SUSE for more information. There are such programs at the cloud providers: Azure MACC Program AWS Enterprise Discount Program Google CUD Yes, it can. Please contact your cloud provider sales team for more details. Once Uyuni PAYG has been deployed from the marketplace listing and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase to manage additional instances. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of instances Uyuni is managing. Just on-board additional instances to Uyuni as needed, this will be reflected in your cloud marketplace bill. By default, the Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is ongoing for as long as Uyuni is deployed and instances are registered. Currently, there is no volume discount available. If you no longer require support, there are 2 options: Unregister all systems from the Uyuni Server Terminate the Uyuni instance.","title":"Billing - General","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-billing-general","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-billing-general.html","titles":[{"text":"I have an existing Uyuni BYOS subscription; can I use this on the cloud?","hash":"_i_have_an_existing_uyuni_byos_subscription_can_i_use_this_on_the_cloud","id":1},{"text":"I have an existing deployment covered by a BYOS Uyuni subscription; can I use this new listing in the cloud for a separate deployment of Uyuni PAYG?","hash":"_i_have_an_existing_deployment_covered_by_a_byos_uyuni_subscription_can_i_use_this_new_listing_in_the_cloud_for_a_separate_deployment_of_uyuni_payg","id":2},{"text":"Tell me more about how the billing for Uyuni PAYG works via the cloud?","hash":"_tell_me_more_about_how_the_billing_for_uyuni_payg_works_via_the_cloud","id":3},{"text":"I have existing SLES for SAP instances procured via the cloud provider marketplace, is there a cost to manage these instance with Uyuni PAYG?","hash":"_i_have_existing_sles_for_sap_instances_procured_via_the_cloud_provider_marketplace_is_there_a_cost_to_manage_these_instance_with_uyuni_payg","id":4},{"text":"Is there a way to try Uyuni PAYG before purchasing?","hash":"_is_there_a_way_to_try_uyuni_payg_before_purchasing","id":5},{"text":"How does SUSE calculate the amount of managed instances to bill for?","hash":"_how_does_suse_calculate_the_amount_of_managed_instances_to_bill_for","id":6},{"text":"Are special commercial terms available?","hash":"_are_special_commercial_terms_available","id":7},{"text":"Can my spending on Uyuni PAYG count towards my committed spend with the cloud provider?","hash":"_can_my_spending_on_uyuni_payg_count_towards_my_committed_spend_with_the_cloud_provider","id":8},{"text":"How do I purchase Uyuni / LCM subscriptions for additional managed instances?","hash":"_how_do_i_purchase_uyuni_lcm_subscriptions_for_additional_managed_instances","id":9},{"text":"Is this an annual commitment, will it auto-renew?","hash":"_is_this_an_annual_commitment_will_it_auto_renew","id":10},{"text":"Is there a volume discount / tiered pricing built into the Cloud Listing?","hash":"_is_there_a_volume_discount_tiered_pricing_built_into_the_cloud_listing","id":11},{"text":"I no longer require support; how can I end the Uyuni PAYG subscription?","hash":"_i_no_longer_require_support_how_can_i_end_the_uyuni_payg_subscription","id":12}]},"555":{"id":555,"text":"Currently, it is not possible to migrate an existing instance to the PAYG version. Customers can simply deploy a new Uyuni PAYG instance from the cloud marketplace and re-onboard all instances using the standard process. Client configuration overview It is simple to open a support case with SUSE for Uyuni PAYG. Create a ‘supportconfig’ via Uyuni PAYG instance CLI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) at the following link: https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport Providing marketplace billing is active, a support case will be opened. The Uyuni PAYG product available in the cloud marketplace is the same product, with similar functionality that you would run on-premises or with a manual installation. The only exceptions being the ability to bill via the cloud marketplace and connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure for Uyuni product updates. It is also worth checking the list of supported client operating systems to ensure your needs are met. It is recommended that the Uyuni instance always remains active. Uyuni PAYG, when deployed via the cloud marketplace will automatically connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure, no separate Uyuni subscription key is required. Updates to the Uyuni instance can be applied from those channels using standard SUSE tooling (i.e. zypper). Yes, Uyuni Hub is recommended for customers with more than 10,000 managed clients. If the Uyuni Hub instance has no connected clients, there will be no charge for the Uyuni Hub software components. Billing will occur from the downstream Uyuni PAYG Server instance, where managed instances are connected. To manage BYOS instances, SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Yes, it is possible to manage instances, in the cloud, on premises or both. To enable management of SUSE workloads in an on-premises data center, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider's network. With a hybrid landscape, egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider. To reduce these costs, SUSE recommend the use of the containerized proxy. Please note: Whilst the SUSE Manger Proxy usage is included as part of the Uyuni PAYG subscription, an LCM+ subscription will be billed if the proxy is also a managed workload, so in other words it counted as a managed client. No, to benefit from cloud marketplace billing, the Uyuni PAYG instance must reside on the cloud. Any Uyuni instances on premises will require their own subscriptions.

To ensure seamless operation, proper AWS permissions for the IAM (Identity and Access Management) role are essential. This role must be attached to the instance, otherwise disconnection errors will be thrown after one hour. You can pre-create the role on your AWS account and then select it from the existing IAM role drop-down during the instance configuration process. If you create the role during the creation of an instance, the role will not be attached automatically. The role should be added post setup. A role can be assigned to a running instance through the following steps: Actions Security Modify IAM-role. It needs to have the following policy attached in order to be used: { \"AttachedPolicies\": [ { \"PolicyName\": \"AWSMarketplaceMeteringFullAccess\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSMarketplaceMeteringFullAccess\" } ] } To allow the EC2 service to assume such role: \"AssumeRolePolicyDocument\": { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": \"ec2.amazonaws.com\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] } IAM role can be attached to an EC2 instance by means of an instance profile, which acts as a container for the role itself. For detailed information on IAM roles, see: docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM Procedure: Configuring your Uyuni instance Select the AMI image and provide a meaningful name for your server. Review the details and pricing information provided. You have the option to configure additional instance details in subsequent steps, such as storage, tags, security groups, and the required IAM role. The image automatically suggests a default CPU configuration. Choose an existing key pair or create a new one to grant access to the instance. Your organization should provide the necessary security groups and network configuration.

Username – the administrator account for the Uyuni VM. SSH Key Source and Key – needed to access the machine. We do not allow the use of a password here. This is to reduce the risk of brute force attacks. Managed Application Details Application Name – the name of the Managed Application. Managed Resource Group (MRG) – where the Uyuni VM and its resources will be deployed into. Instance Size The default for the instance size is D8as v5, which is a good baseline for a production server. It provides enough resources for more data disks and IOPS throughput for disk and network. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dasv5-dadsv5-series If you only need a test instance, you can go smaller and choose an instance size with 4 vCPUs and 16GB memory or use a B-Series (Burstable) instance with a similar configuration. Diagnostic Storage Account If you normally create a VM in the Azure portal, boot diagnostics are enabled by default using a managed storage account. You can choose an existing storage account or create a new one (default). OS Disk Size This is the root disk of the Uyuni installation, which holds: The OS and the Uyuni application. /var/cache – where you need to provide storage space for each product you want to manage. The proposed default of 100GB should be accepted. Database Disk Size This holds the Database for Uyuni and needs a minimum of 50GB. The proposed value of 80GB is a good default suggestion. Spacewalk Disk Size This holds the package repositories and should have at least 100GB. Additional requirements include: 50GB for every SUSE product. >360GB for every RedHat or other Linux product. The proposed default of 500GB is a safe default to start with. Repository synchronization will fail if this directory runs out of disk space. Public IP Address for the VM By default, a Public IP Address is created to access the Uyuni VM and Application. If you use it, please ensure this is secure and access is limited. Running Uyuni on the public cloud means implementing robust security measures. It is essential to limit, filter, monitor, and audit access to the instance. SUSE strongly advises against a globally accessible Uyuni instance that lacks adequate perimeter security. You should carefully consider this, as the Uyuni Server will have access to all managed nodes. If someone gains access to Uyuni, it would mean access to all managed nodes as well. Threat actors actively scan for accessible machines with open management ports (e.g., SSH or RDP), especially on cloud providers. A Network Security Group (NSG) is created by default if you choose to create a Public IP. It only allows inbound SSH access via port 22 as a minimal protection for the public IP. It is recommended to additionally restrict access to a defined list of networks and allow Azure’s virtual network to drop requests originating from other networks. Furthermore, you can add Just-in-Time access and/or use the Azure Bastion Service, Firewall, VPN, or private network methods to secure public access. You can choose not to create a Public IP address (which is more secure), but you will need to use other methods to access the created Uyuni VM and its Web UI for further configuration. Additionally, you must take care of the DNS and ensure a correct FQDN. DNS Prefix for the Public IP Address The Uyuni server must resolve its FQDN correctly. If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause issues in several Uyuni components. To ensure that the Uyuni domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server. You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured. If you use the Public IP address, a DNS name is automatically created from Azure. You only need to ensure that a unique name is used. The default suggestion creates one by including a random number to make the domain name unique. If you do not use the Public IP, you need to make sure that your setup can resolve the FQDN correctly as mentioned above. Virtual Network / Subnet You will see a default proposal for a virtual network where Uyuni will reside. By clicking edit, you can adjust it to your needs. Remember that a Managed Application will be deployed from SUSE to your Azure tenant. Therefore, this network is the network in the Managed Resource Group (MRG) and cannot overlap with existing networks. At a later stage, you need to peer this network to the network with the nodes you want to manage. Alternatively, you can create the managed nodes within this network. With all fields filled out, press Next or Create. The Azure portal will perform a final check and provide a summary screen of this deployment. If everything is correct, press Create to deploy the Managed Application for Uyuni. After the VM is deployed, you can access it via SSH. Usage and Costs Keep in mind that since this is a PAYG image, you will be billed according to your actual usage, including the number of systems you manage and monitor with this instance. It’s essential to regularly track and review your usage to prevent unexpected costs and ensure alignment with your needs.","title":"Initial Preparation and Configuration of the Microsoft Azure Managed Application","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"payg-azure-configure-the-image","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/payg/azure/payg-azure-configure-the-image.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

BYOS (Bring-your-own-subscription) Images Registering BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription. Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the registration process with Uyuni to ensure a smooth and error-free connection. If you have SCC credentials ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images. Do not register PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center. Only BYOS instances should be registered against the SUSE Customer Center. Registering PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved. PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update server when added to your cloud service provider Uyuni instance. For more information on using SUSE PAYG products such as SUSE Linux Enterprise in the public cloud see: SUSE Linux Enterprise Public Cloud Guide It is important to recognize that there is a difference between Pay-as-you-go connections and bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is also known as client registration. Once you have started up your Uyuni PAYG instance and refreshed products you can add Pay-as-you-go connections via the Admin Setup Wizard Pay-as-you-go +Add Pay-as-you-go button. This action links your Uyuni PAYG instance with additional PAYG products on Microsoft Azure. Bootstrapping or client registration is the process of onboarding clients in Uyuni. The registration process installs the appropriate client tools and provides full management functionality. To manage your clients, start by establishing connections and then proceed to bootstrap your clients. These two actions are the steps required for initiating and completing the client onboarding process. Procedure: Connecting SUSE Linux Enterprise PAYG Instances to Uyuni PAYG Return to the Uyuni Server Web UI. Navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Pay-as-you-go and click the +Add Pay-as-you-go button. Add a description. Complete the instance SSH connection data: Host: CSP URL of the machine SSH Port: 22 User: root Password: <password> SSH Private Key Click Create and wait for the sync to finish. Proceed to Admin Setup Wizard Products to access your PAYG SUSE Linux Enterprise products. Now that you have established connections to the Uyuni PAYG instance you can register them as clients. To learn how to register various clients see: Client Registration Methods Inbound and outbound connections to Microsoft Azure are released after 4 minutes of being idle. This affects minion connectivity, especially when your Uyuni server is in Microsoft Azure and you have some on-premises minions. If a connection is idle for more than 4 minutes, connectivity is lost. To resolve this issue on your minions: Procedure: Create a new configuration file at i.a. /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/keepalive.conf and enable keepalive: tcp_keepalive: True tcp_keepalive_intvl: 5 tcp_keepalive_idle: 10 tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3 Restart the venv-salt-minion service.","title":"PAYG Client connections and Client Registration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"payg-azure-connections-and-bootstrapping","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/payg/azure/payg-azure-connections-and-bootstrapping.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Firstly, log in to your Azure account, via https://portal.azure.com This makes sure that the Azure system is able to identify in which country your account get billed. It is important, as billing for Uyuni PAYG is handled via the Azure Marketplace. As there are restrictions on which countries this listing can be billed, the account you will transact to should be the one you are logged into. There are currently two offers for Uyuni PAYG on Microsoft Azure: Uyuni 2025.07 with 24x7 Support (EMEA Orders only) Uyuni 2025.07 with 24x7 Support Pick the listing that reflects in which country your Azure account gets billed. It depends on the sold to address of the account, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/change-azure-account-profile.

Architecture Diagram of a managed application This resource group ( in the diagram ResGroup A ) holds the managed application instance, which could be translated as the metadata or definition of the offering. It can only contain a single resource. A customer has full access to the resource group and uses it to manage the life cycle of the managed application. This resource group ( in the diagram MRG ) holds all the resources that are required by the managed application. For example, an application’s virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks. A managed application is similar to a solution template in Azure Marketplace, with a few key differences: The resources are deployed into a managed resource group that is normally managed by the application’s publisher. It is present in the customer’s subscription, but an identity in the publisher’s tenant can be given access to the managed resource group. The publisher’s management access and the customers deny assignment are optional. There are different permission scenarios available. SUSE is using here the Customer managed to give our customers of SUSE Manager full control. Customer managed Customer Customer has full access to the solution (in the managed resource group) The customer manages the solution Publisher The publisher has no access to manage the solution. The publisher develops the application and publishes on Azure Marketplace but does not manage the application. The publisher licenses the application for billing through Azure Marketplace. When setting up a Uyuni PAYG instance on Microsoft Azure, it’s essential to consider system requirements for optimal performance and functionality. The default requirements outlined below have been tailored for smooth deployment and operation. By default, certain disks are automatically generated when establishing a Uyuni PAYG instance on Microsoft Azure. To complete the setup of these disks, use the mgr-storage-server tool. Table 1.

To get the details, click on the name of the virtual machine. Here you can see the (public) IP address which you need to connect to the running instance. SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system . sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Remember, the Uyuni PAYG setup requires, that a new Virtual Network and a new subnet is configured, which was performed in the previous step. Because Uyuni PAYG is deployed as a 'Managed Application' it is not possible to deploy into an existing network. Before moving on to the next step, ensure the network is correctly configured: When you setup new clients which should be managed, take care that you put them into the private subnet which is configured with Uyuni PAYG or peer your networks. If you want to manage systems in an already existing network, you must configure peering. For more information, see Azure documentation. Procedure: Network Configuration Ensure the network configuration aligns such that hostname -f yields the identical name as the reverse DNS lookup of the private IP address. For instance, when executing nslookup 10.0.0.X. Insert the private IP with its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into /etc/hosts. For example: 10.0.0.4 instancename.location.internal.cloudapp.azure.com Edit /etc/sysconfig/network/config and append internal.cloudapp.azure.com to NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST. Execute netconfig update. Subsequently, hostname -f should return the same FQDN as obtained from nslookup 10.0.0.X. When adding new virtual machines (VMs), such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, it’s crucial to ensure that they are configured within the same subnet as the Uyuni instance, or that you have setup network peering. This step is essential for successful network setup and integration. Additionally, be mindful of the geographical restrictions associated with your plans. Make sure to utilize the appropriate Azure accounts which correspond to the specific geographic zones of your project. Procedure: Configuring Storage SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system: sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Configure storage using the appropriate tool: For a standard setup, use mgr-storage-server. For a proxy configuration, use mgr-storage-proxy. For more details, run: mgr-storage-server --help mgr-storage-proxy --help These tools simplify the creation of container storage and database volumes. Identify the block devices: ls /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/ This command lists the disks created during deployment. Typically: lun3 is the storage disk. lun4 is the database disk. Configure storage using the identified devices: mgr-storage-server /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun3 /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun4 This command creates persistent storage volumes at: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes For more details, see Persistent Container Volumes.

At the same time, RPM based support was removed, and only the containerized version running with podman or k3s is supported. This section describes migrating from Proxy 4.3 using the mgrpxy tool. An in-place migration from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.07 is unsupported. The host operating system has changed from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 to SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. The traditional contact protocol is no longer supported in Uyuni 5.0 and later. Before migrating from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.07, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt. For more information about migrating to Salt clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html Because in-place migration is not supported, the users must deploy a new Uyuni proxy with a new FQDN. For more information about installing Uyuni Proxy, see Install Uyuni Proxy. Before migrating the clients, ensure that the new proxy is already deployed and fully functional.

After a few minutes, the clients will start to show up the new connection path. When all clients have the connection path under the new proxy, the old 4.3 proxy system is not needed anymore and can be removed. Containerized proxies do not use tftpsync mechanism to transfer tftproot files. Instead these files are transparently downloaded and cached on demand. To prevent false positive errors during cobbler sync run, migrated 4.3 proxies need to be removed from tftpsync mechanism. If you previously configured a 4.3 proxy to receive TFTP files, one of the following configuration option is required: In the server container, run configure-tftpsync.sh with the list of remaining 4.3 proxies as arguments. If no 4.3 proxies remain, run configure-tftpsync.sh with no arguments. In the server container, manually remove the relevant proxy from the proxies setting in the /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml file.

An in-place migration from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.07 is not supported, regardless of whether the chosen host operating system is SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Before migrating from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.07, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt. For more information about migrating traditional Uyuni 4.3 clients to Salt clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html. Traditional contact protocol is no longer supported in Uyuni 5.0 and later. This guide only covers the migration from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.07. Migrating an existing Uyuni 2025.07 instance to the same version while switching the host operating system from SL Micro 6.1 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7, or vice versa, is not handled by the mgradm migrate command. The current migration procedure does not include functionality for renaming hostnames. As a result, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the new server will remain the same as that of the old server. The IP address must remain unchanged to ensure that the clients can contact the server. After the migration, it will be necessary to manually update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. Self trusted GPG keys are not migrated. GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated. Thus synchronizing channels with spacewalk-repo-sync can fail. The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the 4.3 installation to the container host after the actual server migration. Procedure: Manual Migration of the 4.3 GPG Keys to New Server Copy the keys from the 4.3 server to the container host of the new server. Later, add each key to the migrated server with the command mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE>. Do not pre-install Uyuni on the prepared SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 system. The migration process is designed to perform the server installation automatically. Running mgradm install and then mgradm migrate is not supported and will lead to an unsupported system state. In the following steps, we are only preparing the host system, not installing the actual Uyuni 2025.07 Server. Procedure: Downloading the Installation Media Locate the SL Micro 6.1 installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/, and download the appropriate media file. Prepare a DVD or USB flash drive with the downloaded .iso image for installation. For more information about preparing your machines (virtual or physical), see the SL Micro Deployment Guide. Procedure: Installing SL Micro 6.1 Insert the DVD or USB flash drive (USB disk or key) containing the installation image for SLE Micro 6.1. Boot or reboot your system. Use the arrow keys to select Installation. Adjust Keyboard and language. Click the checkbox to accept the license agreement. Click Next to continue. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. The Uyuni 2025.07 containers are installed as extensions. Depending on the specific extension needed from the list below, additional SUSE Customer Center registration codes will be required for each. Uyuni 2025.07 Server Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy Uyuni 2025.07 Retail Branch Server The SL Micro 6.1 entitlement is included within the Uyuni entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code. Enter your SUSE Customer Center email address. Enter your registration code for SL Micro 6.1. Click Next to continue. To install a proxy, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Proxy extension; to install a server, select the Uyuni 2025.07 Server extension Checkbox. Click Next to continue. Enter your Uyuni 2025.07 extension registration code. Click Next to continue. On the NTP Configuration page click Next. On the Authentication for the System page enter a password for the root user. Click Next. On the Installation Settings page click Install. This concludes installation of SL Micro 6.1 and Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension. If you added Uyuni 2025.07 as an extension during SL Micro 6.1 installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SL Micro 6.1 installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SL Micro 6.1 installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.07 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the Command Line List available extensions with the following command: transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install: If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.07 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> Reboot. Procedure: Updating the System Log in as root. Run transactional-update: transactional-update Reboot. SL Micro is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates. However, this behavior is not desirable for the Uyuni environment. To prevent automatic updates on your server, Uyuni disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process. If you prefer the SL Micro default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command: systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer Alternatively, you can deploy Uyuni on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. The following procedure describes the main steps of the installation process. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Extensions on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 Locate and download SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 .iso at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/. Make sure that you have regsistration codes both for the host operating system (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7) and extensions Start the installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. On the Language, keyboard and product selection select the product to install. On the License agreement read the agreement and check I Agree to the License Terms. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. Enter your SUSE Customer Center email address. Enter your registration code for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Click Next to continue. Please note that for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7, you are required to have a valid SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscription and corresponding registration code, which you must provide on this screen. You will be required to enter the Uyuni Extension registration code below. In the screen Extensions and Modules Selection check the following: Select the Uyuni Server Extension to install the Server, or the Uyuni Proxy Extension to install the Proxy. Basesystem Module Containers Module Click Next to continue. Enter your Uyuni 2025.07 extension registration code. Click Next to continue. Complete the installation. When the installation completes, log in to the newly installed server as root. Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install): zypper up Reboot. Log in as root and install podman plus mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service This step ensures that the new Uyuni 2025.07 Server can connect to the existing 4.3 Server over SSH without requiring a password. It involves generating and configuring SSH keys, setting up an SSH agent, and copying the public key to the old server. This setup is required for the migration process to run without manual intervention. Procedure: Preparing the SSH Connection Ensure that for root an SSH key exists on the new 2025.07 server. If a key does not exist, create it with: ssh-keygen -t rsa The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server for a connection to the 4.3 server that does not prompt for a password. eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add To establish a connection that does not prompt for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server. If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add followed by the path to the private key. You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. Copy the public SSH key to the Uyuni 4.3 Server (<oldserver.fqdn>) with ssh-copy-id. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the 4.3 server: ssh-copy-id <old server.fqdn> The SSH key will be copied into the old server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. For more information, see the ssh-copy-id manpage. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the old Uyuni Server to check that no password is needed. Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint. In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Then try again. The fingerprint will be stored in the local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. When planning your migration from Uyuni 4.3 to Uyuni 2025.07, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the old setup. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. For example: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. Procedure: Performing the Migration This step is optional. If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-server tool. For more information about mgr-storage-server, see installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#install-hardware-requirements-storage. Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the 4.3 server: Make sure to upgrade your 4.3 server and apply all available updates before starting the migration process. Additionally, remove any unnecessary channels to help reduce the overall migration time. The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the old server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration the processes on the old server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping the services on the old server. For example on Uyuni server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare Procedure: Final Migration Stop the Uyuni services on 4.3 Server: spacewalk-service stop Stop the PostgreSQL service on 4.3 Server: systemctl stop postgresql Perform the migration on Uyuni server mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> Migrate trusted SSL CA certificates. Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on Uyuni 4.3 in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the 4.3 installation after the migration. Procedure: Migrating the Certificates Copy the file from the 4.3 server to the new server. For example, as /local/ca.file. Copy the file into the container with: mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the old 4.3 server. To redirect them to the 2025.07 server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as 4.3 server. Adjusting the IP address can be avoided if the latest version of the minion is installed on the clients, as the newer version can automatically re-connect with the server using only the FQDN. Uyuni 2025.07 introduces a rebranded set of client tools for all supported operating systems. This transition is seamless, and users performing a new product synchronization should only notice the updated channel names. Channels named SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ, used by clients previously registered with Uyuni 4.3 or 5.0, are no longer available in version 5.1 and will no longer receive updates in 5.1. Although the legacy channels remain assigned to existing clients after migration, the corresponding repositories have been removed. To ensure continued updates, users must: Mirror the new SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels for the relevant products and assign them to the appropriate clients. Unassign the outdated SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels. This also means that any CLM projects based on the old client tools must be adjusted accordingly.","title":"Uyuni Server Migration to a Containerized Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"server-mlm-43-51","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/migrations/server/server-mlm-43-51.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
