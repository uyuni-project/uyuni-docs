"The rate at which {productname} can onboard clients is limited and depends "
"on hardware resources.  Onboarding clients at a faster rate than "
"{productname} is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed "
"keys.  This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources.  "
"We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically.  A "
"safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds.  You can "

"All communication to and from Salt clients is encrypted.  During client "

"In older versions, {productname} used a tool called Salt mine to check "

"server every hour, which created significant load.  With the introduction of "
"a more efficient mechanism in {productname}{nbsp}3.2, the Salt mine is no "
"longer required.  Instead, the {productname} Server uses Taskomatic to ping "
"only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, "
"with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour "
"period by default.  You can adjust this by changing the "
"[systemitem]``web.system_checkin_threshold`` parameter in "
"[path]``rhn.conf``.  The value is expressed in days, and the default value "
