"fields.  Formulas allow for reliable reproduction of a specific "

"Formulas work best for large, non-trivial, configurations.  For smaller "
"tasks, use a state rather than a formula.  Formulas and states both act as a "
"kind of configuration documentation.  When you have written and stored the "
"configuration, they provide a snapshot of your infrastructure."
