msgid ""
"In older versions, {productname} used a tool called Salt mine to check "
"client availability.  The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the "
"server every hour, which created significant load.  With the introduction of "
"a more efficient mechanism in {productname}{nbsp}3.2, the Salt mine is no "
"longer required.  Instead, the {productname} Server uses Taskomatic to ping "
"only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, "
"with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour "
"period by default.  You can adjust this by changing the "
"[systemitem]``web.system_checkin_threshold`` parameter in "
"[path]``rhn.conf``.  The value is expressed in days, and the default value "
"is [literal]``1``."
