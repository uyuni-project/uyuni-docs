"Being able to store one file and share identical configurations is useful, "
"but in some cases you might need many variations of the same configuration "
"file, or configuration files that differ only in system-specific details, "
"such as host name and MAC address.  In this case, you can use macros, or "
"variables, within the configuration files.  This allows you to upload and "
"distribute a single file, with hundreds or even thousands of variations.  In "
"addition to variables for custom system information, the following standard "
"macros are supported:"
