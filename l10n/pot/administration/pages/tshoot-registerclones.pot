#. Troubleshooting format:
#
#. One sentence each:
#. Cause: What created the problem?
#. Consequence: What does the user see when this happens?
#. Fix: What can the user do to fix this problem?
#. Result: What happens after the user has completed the fix?
#
#. If more detailed instructions are required, put them in a "Resolving" procedure:
