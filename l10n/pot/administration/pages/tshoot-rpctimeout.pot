"RPC connections can sometimes time out due to slow networks or a network "
"link going down.  This results in package downloads or batch jobs hanging or "
"taking longer than expected.  You can adjust the maximum time that an RPC "
"connection can take by editing the configuration file.  While this will not "
"resolve networking problems, it will cause a process to fail rather than "
"hang."
