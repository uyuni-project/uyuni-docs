"Registering clients (either traditional or Salt) via {susemgrproxy} with a "
"bootstrap script is done almost the same way as registering clients directly "
"with the {productname} Server.  The difference is that you create the "
"bootstrap script on the {susemgrproxy} with a command line tool.  The "
"bootstrap script then deploys all necessary information to the clients.  The "
"bootstrap script requires some parameters (such as activation keys or GPG "
"keys) that depend on your specific setup."
