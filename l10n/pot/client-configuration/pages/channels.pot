"Channels are a method of grouping software packages.  Software packages are "
"provided by repositories, and repositories are associated with channels.  "
"Subscribing a client to a software channel allows the client to install and "
"update any of the software associated with it."

"In {productname}, channels are divided into base channels and child "
"channels.  Organizing channels in this way ensures that only compatible "
"packages are installed on each system.  A client must be subscribed to only "
"one base channel, assigned during registration based on the client operating "
"system and architecture.  For paid channels provided by a vendor, you must "
"have an associated subscription."

"A base channel consists of packages built for a specific operating system "
"type, version, and architecture.  For example, the {sles}{nbsp}15 {x86_64} "
"base channel contains only software compatible with that operating system "
"and architecture."

"A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides only packages "
"that are compatible with the base channel.  A system can be subscribed to "
"multiple child channels of its base channel.  When a system has been "
"assigned to a base channel, it is only possible for that system to install "
"the related child channels.  For example, if a system has been assigned to "
"the {sles}{nbsp}15 `x86_64` base channel, they will only be able to install "
"or update packages made available through the compatible base channel, or "
"any of its associated child channels."
