#. This is general autoyast info, not specific to SUMA. LKB 2019-07-29
#
#. When a machine is to receive a network-based {ay} installation, the following events must occur in this order:
#
#. . After being connected to the network and turned on, the machine's PXE logic broadcasts its MAC address and requests to be discovered.
#. . If no static IP address is used, the DHCP server recognizes the discovery request and offers network information needed for the new machine to boot. This includes an IP address, the default gateway to be used, the netmask of the network, the IP address of the TFTP or HTTP server holding the bootloader program, and the full path and file name to that program (relative to the server's root).
#. . The machine applies the networking information and initiates a session with the server to request the bootloader program.
#. . The bootloader searches for its configuration file on the server from which it was loaded. This file dictates which Kernel and Kernel options, such as the initial RAM disk (initrd) image, should be executed on the booting machine. Assuming the bootloader program is SYSLINUX, this file is located in the [path]``pxelinux.cfg`` directory on the server and named the hexadecimal equivalent of the new machine's IP address. For example, a bootloader configuration file for {sles} should contain:
#. +
#
#. ----
#. port 0
#. prompt 0
#. timeout 1
#. default autoyast
#. label autoyast
#.   kernel vmlinuz
#.   append autoyast=http://`my_susemanager_server`/`path`\
#.     install=http://`my_susemanager_server`/`repo_tree`
#. ----
#. . The machine accepts and uncompresses the initrd and kernel, boots the kernel, fetches the instsys from the install server and initiates the {ay} installation with the options supplied in the bootloader configuration file, including the server containing the {ay} configuration file.
#. . The new machine is installed based on the parameters established within the {ay} configuration file.
