"Registering clients with a bootstrap script gives you control over "

"at once.  This method works for both Salt and traditional clients."

"To register clients using a bootstrap script, we recommend you create a "
"template bootstrap script to begin, which can then be copied and modified.  "
"The bootstrap script you create is executed on the client when it is "
"registered, and ensures all the necessary packages are deployed to the "
"client.  There are some parameters contained in the bootstrap script, which "
"ensure the client system can be assigned to its base channel, including "
"activation keys and GPG keys."
