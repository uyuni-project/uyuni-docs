"System locks are used to prevent actions from occurring on a client.  For "
"example, a system lock will prevent a client from being updated or "
"restarted.  This is useful for clients running production software, or to "
"prevent accidental changes.  You can disable the system lock when you are "
"ready to perform actions."
