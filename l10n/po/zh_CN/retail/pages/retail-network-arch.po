"Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service "
"terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office.  We recommend "
"you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its "
"terminals.  Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an "
"image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages).  "
"The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS "
"services."
