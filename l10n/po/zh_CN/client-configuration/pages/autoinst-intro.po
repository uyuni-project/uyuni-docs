"For most clients, you can use an autoinstallation file.  The "
"autoinstallation file contains information about the distribution to install "
"on the clients.  There are two main types of autoinstallation file.  For "
"{sle} clients, use {ay}.  For {rhel} clients, use {kickstart}.  When you "
"have created an autoinstallation file, you can upload and manage it in the "
"{productname} {webui}.  The {webui} also provides tools to help you edit and "
"maintain your autoinstallation files.  For more information about "
"autoinstallation files, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-setup.adoc[]."

"When you have created your autoinstallation files, you can create a profile "
"to manage them.  This makes it easier to store and manage multiple "
"autoinstallation files for different types of clients.  For more information "

"When you are ready to perform the autoinstallation, you need to make the "
"{productname} Server aware of the client.  This is called provisioning.  You "
"can provision a client by enabling bare metal provisioning.  Using this "
"method, when a client connects to an IP address within a given range, the "
"autoinstallation begins.  You can also use Cobbler and PXE booting to "
"provision clients within your network.  Alternatively, you can provision "
"clients using the {productname}Â API.  For more information about client "
"provisioning, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-provisioning.adoc[]."
