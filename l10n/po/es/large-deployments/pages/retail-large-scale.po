"{smr} {productnumber} is an open source infrastructure management solution, "
"optimized and tailored specifically for the retail industry.  It uses the "
"same technology as {susemgr}, but is customized to address the needs of "
"retail organizations."

"{smr} is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-"
"of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, "
"or collect loyalty points.  In addition to retail installations, it can also "
"be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an "
"educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals."

"{smr} is intended for use in installations that include servers, "
"workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices.  It allows "
"administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their "
"servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service "
"machines."

"Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as "
"point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and "
"reverse-vending systems.  Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, "
"who set basic information about the device in the firmware.  {smr} accesses "
"this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in "
"use."

"In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system "
"(OS) image to ensure they work correctly.  For example, an information kiosk "
"has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have "
"a very basic display.  While both of these terminals require similar "
"processing and network functionality, they will require different OS "
"images.  The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work "
"correctly."
