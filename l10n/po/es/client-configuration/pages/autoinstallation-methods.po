"We recommend that you use PXE boot for installing clients.  PXE booting "
"requires a DHCP server that points to your {productname} Server.  The "
"{productname} Server then acts as a TFTP server.  The TFTP environment is "
"generated with Cobbler.  Cobbler can also generate a bootable ISO image.  "
"The ISO image can be used to install machines when PXE boot is not an "
"option.  For more information about Cobbler, see xref:client-configuration:"
"cobbler.adoc[]."
