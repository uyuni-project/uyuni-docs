"{productname} Proxy is a {productname} component that caches software "
"packages on an internal server.  The proxy also caches patch updates from "
"{suse} or custom RPMs generated by third-party organizations.  A proxy "
"allows you to use bandwidth more effectively because client systems connect "
"to the proxy for updates, and the {productname} server is no longer required "
"to handle all client requests.  A {susemgrproxy} can serve both Traditional "
"and Salt clients.  The proxy also supports transparent custom package "
"deployment."
