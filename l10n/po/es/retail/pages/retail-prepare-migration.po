"{slepos} cannot be upgraded directly to {smr}, so the migration process "

"In some cases, this will require a lengthy downtime to perform the "

"servers and run them in parallel to the existing ones while you perform the "

"It is possible to run a SLEPOS Admin server and a {susemgr} server in "

"the {susemgr} server, while those that have not yet been migrated can "
"continue to run on the SLEPOS Admin server.  This includes all operations, "
"such as adding new terminals, or building and deploying new images."

"However, if you run network services (especially DHCP) on the branch "
"servers, you will not be able to run both old and new branch servers in "
"parallel on the same branch, because they can conflict with each other.  "
"This can result in multiple terminals having the same IP address, or "
"terminals randomly assigned to different branch servers.  If you need to "
"migrate in this environment, and you want to configure a new branch server "
"while the branch is still running on old infrastructure, make sure that the "
"new branch server is not connected to the network with the terminals."
