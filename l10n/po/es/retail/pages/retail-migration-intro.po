#. == What is {smr}?
#
#. {smr} is an open source infrastructure management solution, optimized and tailored specifically for the retail industry.
#. It uses the same technology as {susemgr}, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations.
#
#. {smr} is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points.
#. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals.
#
#. {smr} is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices.
#. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines.
