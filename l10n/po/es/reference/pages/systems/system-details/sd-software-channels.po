"When a product moves out of the beta program to a released version, the "
"repositories are updated with the new packages.  However, the repository "
"names do not change.  When a beta program is released, you will need to "
"refresh the software channels to get the updated packages.  You can do this "
"manually by running [command]``mgr-sync refresh`` and "
"[command]``spacewalk-repo-sync``.  Alternatively, these will be run "
"automatically by Taskomatic during the next regular refresh."
