"spacecmd is the traditional tool for spacewalk.  It functions out of the box "
"with SUSE Manager but you should know that latest features (for example, "
"Salt) are often excluded from traditional spacecmd command-line tool.  To "
"gain access to the latest feature additions call [command]``api "
"api.getApiCallList`` from within spacecmd to list all currently available "
"API commands formatted in json.  You can then call these commands directly."
