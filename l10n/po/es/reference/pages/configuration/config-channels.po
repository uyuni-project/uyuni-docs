"{productname} manages both central and local configuration channels and "
"files.  Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration "
"files to multiple systems, and is available for both traditional and salt "
"clients.  For traditional clients, use local configuration management.  For "
"salt clients, use state channels.  For traditional clients, local "
"configuration management is also available.  Local configuration management "
"allows you to specify overrides, and select configuration files that are not "
"changed when the system is subscribed to a central channel."
