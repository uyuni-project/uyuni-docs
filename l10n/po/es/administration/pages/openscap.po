"The Security Certification and Authorization Package (SCAP) is a "

"SCAP was created to provide a standardized approach to maintaining system "

"{productname} uses OpenSCAP to implement the SCAP specifications.  OpenSCAP "
"is an auditing tool that utilizes the Extensible Configuration Checklist "
"Description Format (XCCDF).  XCCDF is a standard way of expressing checklist "
"content and defines security checklists.  It also combines with other "
"specifications such as Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common "
"Configuration Enumeration (CCE), and Open Vulnerability and Assessment "
"Language (OVAL), to create a SCAP-expressed checklist that can be processed "
"by SCAP-validated products."
