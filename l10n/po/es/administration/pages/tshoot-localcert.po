"Some older bootstrap scripts create a link to the local certificate in the "
"wrong place.  This results in zypper returning an ``Unrecognized error`` "
"about the local issuer certificate.  You can ensure that the link to the "
"local issuer certificate has been created correctly by checking the "
"[path]``/etc/ssl/certs/`` directory.  If you come across this problem, you "
"should consider updating your bootstrap scripts to ensure that zypper "
"operates as expected."
