"If the subscription matcher is not automatically matching a particular "

"However, the matcher will not always respect a pin.  It depends on the "

"applied to the client.  Additionally, pins will be ignored if they result in "
"a match that violates the terms and conditions of the subscription, or if "
"the matcher detects a more accurate match if the pin is ignored."
