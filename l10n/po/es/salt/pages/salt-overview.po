"to refer to Salt machines that are connected to and controlled by the Salt "
"master on the {productname} Server.  This is to clearly differentiate them "
"from traditional clients.  In other documentation, and in some internal "
"references, Salt clients are sometimes referred to as Salt `minions` "
"instead.  This is a difference in terminology only."
