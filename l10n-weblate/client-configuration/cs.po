#. This is general kickstart info, not specific to SUMA. LKB 2019-07-29
#. [[s4-system-ks-intro-explain]]
#. == Kickstart Explained
#. When a machine is to receive a network-based {kickstart}, the following events must occur in this order:
#. . After being connected to the network and turned on, the machine's PXE logic broadcasts its MAC address and requests to be discovered.
#. . If no static IP address is used, the DHCP server recognizes the discovery request and offers network information needed for the new machine to boot. This information includes an IP address, the default gateway to be used, the netmask of the network, the IP address of the TFTP or HTTP server holding the bootloader program, and the full path and file name of that program (relative to the server's root).
#. . The machine applies the networking information and initiates a session with the server to request the bootloader program.
#. . The bootloader searches for its configuration file on the server from which it was loaded. This file dictates which kernel and kernel options, such as the initial RAM disk (initrd) image, should be executed on the booting machine. Assuming the bootloader program is SYSLINUX, this file is located in the [path]``pxelinux.cfg`` directory on the server and named the hexadecimal equivalent of the new machine's IP address. For example, a bootloader configuration file for Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 2.1 should contain:
#. +
#. ----
#. port 0
#. prompt 0
#. timeout 1
#. default My_Label
#. label My_Label
#.       kernel vmlinuz
#.       append ks=http://`my_susemanager_server`/`path`#.           initrd=initrd.img network apic
#. ----
#. . The machine accepts and uncompresses the init image and kernel, boots the kernel, and initiates a Kickstart installation with the options supplied in the bootloader configuration file, including the server containing the Kickstart configuration file.
#. . This {kickstart} configuration file in turn directs the machine to the location of the installation files.
#. . The new machine is built based on the parameters established within the Kickstart configuration file.

#. Moved to System Locking chapter --LKB 2020-07-17
#. // Why do we talk about Package Locks here? ke, 2019-12-18
#. // see https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs/issues/41
#. == Package Locks
#. [NOTE]
#. ====
#. Package locks can only be used on traditional clients that use the Zypper package manager.
#. The feature is not currently supported on {rhel} or Salt clients.
#. ====
#. Package locks are used to prevent unauthorized installation or upgrades to software packages on traditional clients.
#. When a package has been locked, it shows a padlock icon, indicating that it can not be installed.
#. Any attempt to install a locked package is reported as an error in the event log.
#. Locked packages can not be installed, upgraded, or removed, either through the {productname} {webui}, or directly on the client machine using a package manager.
#. Locked packages also indirectly lock any dependent packages.
#. .Procedure: Using Package Locks
#. . On the client machine, install the [package]``zypp-plugin-spacewalk`` package as [systemitem]``root``:
#. +
#. ----
#. zypper in zypp-plugin-spacewalk
#. ----
#. . Navigate to the menu:Software[Packages > Lock] tab on the managed system to see a list of all available packages.
#. . Select the packages to lock, and click btn:[Request Lock].
#. You can also choose to enter a date and time for the lock to activate.
#. Leave the date and time blank if you want the lock to activate as soon as possible.
#. Note that the lock might not activate immediately.
#. . To remove a package lock, select the packages to unlock and click btn:[Request Unlock].
#. Leave the date and time blank if you want the lock to deactivate as soon as possible.
#. Note that the lock might not deactivate immediately.

Create an Uyuni server, sync Leap 15.1 (spacewalk-common-channels), create a Leap 15.1, onboard it, sync Leap 15.2 (spacewalk-common-channels), and then try to adjust the channels and trying to upgrade. I recommend you use VMs and take snapshots of the VMs so you can repeat steps as needed.

#. +
#. [NOTE]
#. ====
#. Do not use ``HTTPS``.
#. Use `HTTP` instead to avoid errors.
#. ====
#. +
#. . After adding the repository containing the necessary Salt packages execute:
#. +
#. ----
#. zypper in salt-minion
#. ----
#. . Modify the client configuration file to point to the fully qualified domain name ([replaceable]``FQDN``) of the {productname} server (master):
#. +
#. ----
#. vi /etc/salt/minion
#. ----
#. +
#. Find and change the line:

#. ----
#. master: salt
#. ----
#. +
#. to:
#. +
#. ----
#. master: FQDN.server.example.com
#. ----
#. . Restart the Salt client with:
#. +
#. ----
#. systemctl restart salt-minion
#. ----
#. Your newly registered client should now show up within the {webui} under menu:Salt[Keys].
#. Accept the [guimenu]``pending`` key to begin management.

#. LKB 2020-06-03
#. CCFR for reference:
#. * Cause: To register older clients ({centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, or {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients), the server needs to support older types of SSL encryption, to successfully register them.
#. * Consequence: When trying to register on the CLI, registration fails with this error:
#. +
#. ----
#. Repository '<Repository_Name>' is invalid.
#. [|] Valid metadata not found at specified URLs
#. Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.

#. This must be done manually on the server, and with a Salt state on the Proxy, if applicable.
