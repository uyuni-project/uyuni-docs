#. Cause: User firewall is set to block outgoing traffic by dropping the packet request. During sync with SCC, SUMA waits for an answer on each URL until it times out, eventually causing the entire refresh of the product list to timeout. Applies only to third party (non-SUSE) products, as sync with SCC needs to access locations other than SCC to verify if the if the download location is valid.
#. Consequence: The sync to SCC fails, and the third party products are not shown in the product list.
#. Fix: Configure the firewall to reject requests from SUMA instead of drop (preferred), or configure a firewall on the server (if no ability to change firewall settings)
#. Result: Sync to SCC is either able to reach the URLs required, or rejects the request so that the request fails rather than times out.
