#. .Procedure: Synchronizing Software Channels
#. . On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, register the parent channel:
#. +
#. ----
#. spacewalk-common-channels opensuse_leap15_2
#. ----
#. . Enable the child channels:

#. ----
#. spacewalk-common-channels opensuse_leap15_2-updates
#. spacewalk-common-channels uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-152
#. spacewalk-common-channels opensuse_leap15_2-uyuni-client
#. ----
#. +
#.   If registration is successful, this message is shown:
#. +
#. ----
#. # Base channel 'openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)' - exists
#. ----
#. . Synchronize all repositories, which will take a lot of time to finish:

#. ----
#. // Trouble shooting:
#. If you do not enable the ``opensuse_leap15_2`` parent channel first, you will see the following error:
#. ----
#. # ERROR: opensuse_leap15_2-x86_64 could not be found at the server
#. # ERROR: opensuse_leap15_2-uyuni-client-x86_64: redstone.xmlrpc.XmlRpcFault: unhandled internal exception: User 1 does not have access to channel opensuse_leap15_2-x86_64 or the channel does not exist
#. ----
#. FIXME, ke: we should think about this later:
#. Next we need to adapt kiwi profile for Leap {opensuse-version}, it is possible to simply modify JeOS7 for SLE15SP2 by
#. dropping few SLE specific packages and directives:
#.          <bootsplash-theme>SLE</bootsplash-theme>
#.          <bootloader-theme>SLE</bootloader-theme>
#.          <package name="grub2-branding-SLE" bootinclude="true"/>
#.          <package name="SUSEConnect"/>
#.          <package name="suse-build-key"/>
#.          <package name="plymouth-branding-SLE"/>
#.          <package name="sles-release"/>
#.          <package name="rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage"/>
#. Side note: I plan to publish modified profile somewhere, but I haven't decided where yet as it is uyuni and
#. feature without support.
#. Then it is possible to build the image using modified kiwi profile and deploy it to terminal as usual (there is
#. nothing specific for Uuyni).
#. The rest of things ({saltboot} formula and formula for image syncing works just the same way as SUMA.)
#. Only thing that behaves differently is naming of terminals, for some reason dashes are used instead of
#. HWTYPE (for example). But fortunately it has no impact on (at least basic) functionality of terminal.
