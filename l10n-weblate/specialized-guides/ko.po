#. [WARNING]
#. ====
#. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used.
#. In some cases, they can cause {productname} to completely cease functioning.
#. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment.
#. During implementation, take care when changing parameters.
#. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result.

#. ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
#. [WARNING]
#. ====
#. We strongly recommend that you contact SUSE Consulting for assistance with tuning.
#. SUSE will not provide support for catastrophic failure when these advanced parameters are modified without consultation.
#. ====
#. endif::[]
#. [WARNING]
#. ====
#. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients.
#. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations.
#. ====
#. == The Tuning Process
#. Any {productname} installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables.
#. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels.
#. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters.
#. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance.
#. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit.
#. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph.
#. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters.
#. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph.
#. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning.
#. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values.
#. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure.
#. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment.
#. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph.
#. // missing file?
#. image::parameter_graph.svg[Tuning dependency graph]
#. // Arghh! My eyes! LKB 2019-08-09
#. .Key to the Dependency Graph
#. * 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints
#. * Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints
#. * Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file:
#. ** Red: Apache `httpd` configuration files
#. ** Blue: Salt configuration files
#. ** Brown: Tomcat configuration files
#. ** Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files
#. ** Purple: `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`
#. * Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter
#. * Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues
#. After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases:
#. * If your tuning inputs change significantly
#. * If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed.
#. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file.
#. * If performance is not satisfactory
#. To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again.
#. Start from the node where significant change has happened.
#. == Environmental Variables
#. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process).
#. [[network-bandwidth]]
#. Network Bandwidth::
#. A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the {productname} Server host to the clients or {productname} Proxy hosts.
#. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients.
#. [[channel-count]]
#. Channel count::
#. The number of expected channels to manage.
#. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels.
#. [[client-count]]
#. Client count::
#. The total number of actual or expected clients.
#. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible.
#. [[os-mix]]
#. OS mix::
#. The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed.
#. This is ordered by family ({sle}, openSUSE, {rhel}, or {ubuntu} based).
#. Storage and computing requirements are different in each case.
#. [[user-count]]
#. User count::
#. The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the {webui} plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API.

#.                          Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones.
#. | Tune when            | xref:client-count[Client count] increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and {productname} excludes them from calls.

#.                          After xref:java-salt-presence-ping-timeout[`java.salt_presence_ping_timeout`] seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (`find_job`) is sent to the client for a final check.
#.                          This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered offline.
#.                          Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones.

#. === `java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers`
#. [cols="1,1"]
#. |===
#. | Description          | Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it.
#.                          Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run.
#.                          This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that {productname} will use to recompute the channel metadata.
#.                          Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner.

#.                          Generation of metadata, especially for some OSs, can be memory-intensive, so this parameter might need raising depending on the managed xref:os-mix[OS mix].
#. | Tune when            | xref:java-taskomatic-channel-repodata-workers[`java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers`] increases, OSs are added to {productname} (particularly {rhel} or {ubuntu}), or `OutOfMemoryException` errors appear in `/var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`.

#. [[memory-usage]]
#. === Memory Usage
#. Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components.
#. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change.
#. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it.
#. Operating system::
#. Stop all {productname} services and inspect the output of [command]``free -h``.
#. Java-based components::
#. This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and `rhn-search`.
#. These services support a configurable memory cap.
#. The {productname} Server::
#. Depends on many factors and can only be estimated.
#. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking xref:shared-buffers[`shared_buffers`], permanently.
#. You can also multiply xref:work-mem[`work_mem`] and xref:max-connections[`max_connections`], and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM.
#. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data.
#. These often automatically occupy any available RAM.
#. It is important that the {productname} Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance.
#. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases.
#. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the `effective_cache_size` parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly.
#. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage.
#. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the {productname} Server, use this command:
#. ----
#. pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log
#. ----
#. This command will save a copy of displayed data in the `pidstat-memory.log` file for later analysis.

#. There is no hard maximum number of supported systems.
#. Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation.
#. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured.
#. [WARNING]
#. ====
#. Large installations require standard Salt clients.
#. These instructions cannot be used in environments using traditional clients or Salt SSH minions.
#. ====
#. == Hardware and Infrastructure
#. Not all problems can be solved with better hardware, but choosing the right hardware is an absolute necessity for large scale deployments.
#. The minimum requirements for the {productname} Server are:
#. * Eight or more recent {x86_64} CPU cores.
#. * 32{nbsp}GiB RAM.
#. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64{nbsp}GB or more.
#. * Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs.
#. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs.
#. If the {productname} Server is virtualized, enable the `elevator=none` kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance.
#. You can check the current status with [command]``cat /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler``.
#. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets.
#. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use [command]``echo none > /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler``.
#. The minimum requirements for the {productname} Proxy are:
#. * One {productname} Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth.
#. * Two or more recent {x86_64} CPU cores.
#. * 16{nbsp}GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching.
#. Clients should never be directly attached to the {productname} Server in production systems.
#. In large scale installations, the {productname} Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients.
#. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use.
#. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time.
#. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account.
#. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy.
#. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle.
#. You can use this formula to calculate the download time:
#. ----
#. Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60
#. ----
#. For example, the total time needed to transfer 400{nbsp}MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1{nbsp}GB/s to 3000 clients:
#. ----
#. 400 MB  * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min
#. ----
#. == Operation Recommendations
#. This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments.
#. [NOTE]
#. ====
#. Always start small and scale up gradually.
#. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early.
#. ====
#. // Might be worth alphabetising these. LKB 2018-08-09
#. === Salt Client Onboarding Rate
#. The rate at which {productname} can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources.
#. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than {productname} is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys.
#. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources.
#. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically.
#. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds.
#. You can do that with this command:
#. ----
#. for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done
#. ----
#. === Salt Clients and the RNG
#. All communication to and from Salt clients is encrypted.
#. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel.
#. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications.
#. This is especially true in virtualized environments.
#. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options.
#. You can check the amount of available entropy with the [command]``cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail``.
#. It should never be below 100-200.
#. === Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys
#. Clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than clients that have been onboarded.
#. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client.
#. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra.
#. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients.
#. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance.
#. === Disabling the Salt Mine
#. In older versions, {productname} used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability.
#. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load.
#. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in {productname}{nbsp}3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required.
#. Instead, the {productname} Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default.
#. You can adjust this by changing the [systemitem]``web.system_checkin_threshold`` parameter in [path]``rhn.conf``.
#. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is [literal]``1``.
#. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default.
#. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it.
#. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients.
#. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server:
#. ----
#. salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up
#. ----
#. This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server.
#. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load.
#. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command:
#. ----
#. salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up
#. ----
#. You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.
#. Do not end the process with kbd:[Ctrl+C].
#. === Disable Unnecessary Taskomatic jobs
#. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs.
#. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the {productname} {webui}, at menu:Admin[Task Schedules].
#. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select [guimenu]``Disable Schedule``, and click  btn:[Update Schedule].
#. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click  btn:[Delete Schedule].
#. We recommend disabling these jobs:
#. * Daily comparison of configuration files: [systemitem]``compare-configs-default``
#. * Hourly synchronization of {cobbler} files: [systemitem]``cobbler-sync-default``
#. * Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: [systemitem]``gatherer-matcher-default``
#. Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent {productname} from functioning correctly.
#. === Swap and Monitoring
#. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your {productname} Server constantly monitored and backed up.
#. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance.
#. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM.
#. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory.
#. For more information on tuning, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-large-scale-tuning.adoc[].
#. === AES Key Rotation
#. Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key.
#. The key is rotated when:
#.  * The ``salt-master`` process is restarted, or
#.  * Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from {productname})
#. After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master.
#. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message.
#. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the {productname} Server.
#. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.
