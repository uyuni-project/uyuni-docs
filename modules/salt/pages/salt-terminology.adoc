= Terminology


Beacon::
Beacons allow you to use the Salt event system to monitor non-Salt processes.
Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring.
When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor.
+
To use beacons on {sles} Salt clients, install the [package]``python-pyinotify`` package.
For {rhel} systems, install the [package]``python-inotify`` package.
+
For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/beacons/


Broker::
The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other.
+
The Salt broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy.
+
For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/peer.html.


Environment::
{productname} implements Salt with a single environment.
Multiple Salt environments are not supported.


Grain::
Grains provide information about the hardware of a client.
This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory.
+
When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called.
+
Salt modules are stored on clients and the {productname} Server within the [path]``/usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/`` directory.
+
List all available grains with the [command]``grains.ls`` function:
+
----
salt '*' grains.ls
----
+
You can also use [command]``grains.items`` to list collected grain system data:
+
----
salt '*' grains.items
----
+
For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/.


Highstate::
This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time.
The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas.


Key Fingerprints::
Key fingerprints are exchanged between the {productname} Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client.
This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server.
You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to menu:Salt[Keys].


Pillar::
Pillars are created on the {productname} Server.
They contain information about a client or group of clients.
+
Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients.
Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data.
+
For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html.


State::
States are configuration templates.
They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running.
+
States are written, and then applied to the target systems.
This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them.
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not update the [package]``salt`` package using states.
Update all other system packages using states.
You can then update the [package]``salt`` package from the {productname} {webui} as a separate step.
