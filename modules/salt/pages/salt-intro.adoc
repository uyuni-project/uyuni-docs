Salt is a remote execution engine, configuration management and orchestration system used by {productname} to manage clients.

In {productname}, the Salt master runs on the {productname} Server, allowing you to register and manage Salt clients.

This book is designed to be a primer for using Salt with {productname}.

For more information about Salt, see the Salt documentation at https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/contents.html.

The current version of Salt in {productname} is {saltversion}.

[NOTE]
====
Throughout the {productname} documentation, we use the term `Salt clients` to refer to Salt machines that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the {productname} Server.
This is to clearly differentiate them from traditional clients.
In other documentation, and in some internal references, Salt clients are sometimes referred to as Salt `minions` instead.
This is a difference in terminology only.
