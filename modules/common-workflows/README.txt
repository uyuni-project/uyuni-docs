Follow these instructions each time you create a new document for the workflow you want to describe.

1. Navigate to pages directory.

2. Make a copy of the workflow-TEMPLATE.txt file and rename it as workflow-your-chosen-filename.adoc (note the change in extension)

3. Use full words in "your-chosen-filename", separating each word with the dash "-". 
E.g. instead of workflow-clm.adoc, use workflow-content-lifecycle-management.adoc.

4. The instructions within the template are not strict rules but guidelines for creating the document.
They outline main types of information the file needs to contain.

5. When the workflow file is ready, amend file nav-common-workflows-guide.adoc to add the topic to the navigation bar.
Add the new topic to the navigation bar in alphabetical order.

6. Add entry to .changelog file.

7. Submit the PR. Add at least two members of the Doc Squad as reviewers.
