= Liberate {rhel} 8.10 with secureboot


To successfully liberate {rhel} 8.10 server with secure boot enabled, ensure that the installed kernel, grub2, and shim-x64 packages meet minimum version requirements to prevent boot failures after the migration.

For a fresh server with secure boot, [literal]`shim-x64-15.8-2.el8_10.x86_64` package is installed during liberation.
The other components must be updated manually to specific versions.
