= Install {productname} on {ppc64le}

This guide demonstrates how to set up {productname} Server using SelfInstall ISO image on {ppc64le} machine.


== Use case

This workflow outlines the steps to install {productname} on a {ppc64le} architecture using the SelfInstall ISO image.
The method is used to create a container host for {productname}, allowing for efficient management of your systems.


== Outcome

Successful completion of this workflow results in successful installation of {productname} Server running on a {ppc64le} system.


== Step-by-step instructions

[NOTE]
====
The following workflow is complex and time-consuming.
Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment.
====

.Procedure: Preparing the prerequisites
[role=procedure]
. Prepare a physical or virtual machine that supports the {ppc64le} architecture.
. Ensure access to the SUSE SelfInstall ISO image for {productname} (either 512 or 4096 block size, depending on your disk configuration).
. Ensure sufficient storage for the root disk (40GB recommended) and a separate, large, fast storage device for persistent volumes.
. Ensure network connectivity for registration and updates from {scclongform}.
. Prepare a valid LCM+ subscription key.



.Procedure: Installing {productname}
[role=procedure]

. Download and prepare the installation media:
.. Download the SelfInstall ISO image for the appropriate physical block size (512 or 4096) from suse.com.
   For example: [literal]``SUSE-Manager-Server.ppc64le-5.0.2-SelfInstall-ppc-4096-2024.12.install.iso``
.. Create a new instance with a root disk size of 40GB (recommended).
.. Attach the SelfInstall ISO as a virtual CD and attach large, fast storage for the persistent volume.

. Boot from SelfInstall ISO:
.. Boot from the SelfInstall ISO and follow the on-screen prompts.
.. Select the desired disk for the root partition [literal]``(/)``. The system will copy the disk image to the selected volume.

. Finalize the installation and initial setup:
.. Shut down the instance and remove the virtual CD-ROM from the boot sequence.
.. Start the instance. 
   It will boot from the newly installed {productname} host OS.
.. The system will adapt to the disk size and allow you to log in.

. Register with {scc} and apply updates:
.. Register the {productname} server with {scc} using the [command]``SUSEConnect`` command, including the {productname} Extension.
.. Use your ppc64le LCM+ subscription key for registration.
.. Apply all available updates using [literal]``transactional-update``.
.. Reboot the system as directed.

. Install required packages:
.. Install the packages to use this instance as a container host for {productname}
+
----
transactional-update pkg install netavark podman \
mgradm mgrctl uyuni-storage-setup-server

----
+
.. Provision persistent storage for {productname}
+
----
mgr-storage-server $device
----
+
Ensure [literal]``$device`` points to the fast, persistent storage.
