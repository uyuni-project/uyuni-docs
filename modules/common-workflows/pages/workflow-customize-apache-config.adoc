= Customize Apache Configuration
:revdate: 2026-01-27
:page-revdate: {revdate}


This workflow shows you how to add custom configuration to {productname}} components, specifically the Apache HTTP server, within a containerized environment. 
It ensures that your custom configurations are stored in a persisted volume and are not overwritten during image updates.


== Use case

This workflow is beneficial when:

• You need to overwrite or extend the default Apache configuration.
• You need to ensure that configuration changes persist after a container image update.
• You want to add specific tuning configurations to the server.


== Outcome

After completing this workflow, your custom Apache configuration will be active and will persist through future updates or restarts of the {productname}} containers.


== Preparation

Before you start, you should have:

* Root access to the {productname} Server host.
* Knowledge of the specific Apache directives you wish to apply.


== Step-by-step workflow instructions

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should only add new configuration files, and not modify the existing configuration files provided by the image.

. Navigate to the configuration directory. 
  You must create your new configuration file in the path [path]``/etc/apache2/conf.d``, as this folder is persisted.
