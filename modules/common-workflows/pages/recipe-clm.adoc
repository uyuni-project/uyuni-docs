= Content Lifecycle Management

If you are managing a lot of clients and you need to apply customized packages to them, you can use content lifecycle management (CLM) to manage your packages.
CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients.
It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window.



== Problem

Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients.
You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients.



== Solution

When you have completed this recipe, you will have a content lifecycle project set up.
You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle.



== Before you begin

Before you start, you should already have:

* A {productname} Server installed, which you can access using the {webui}.
* A client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your {productname} Server is on, using SSH.
* Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using.



== Steps

Create a new CLM project::
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Projects], and click btn:[Create Project].
  Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click btn:[Create].

. In the [guimenu]``Sources`` section, click btn:[Attach/Detach Sources].
  Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project.
  The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended.
  Check the child channels you require, and click btn:[Save] to return to the project page.

. Leave the [guimenu]``Filters`` section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example.
  You can add filters later on if you need to.
. In the [guimenu]``Environment Lifecycle`` section, create three environments: ``production``, ``testing``, and ``development``.
  Click btn:[Add Environment] and complete the name and label for each.
  For the ``production`` environment, leave the [guimenu]``Insert before`` field blank.
  For the ``testing`` environment, in the [guimenu]``Insert before`` field, select ``production``.
  For the ``development`` environment, in the [guimenu]``Insert before field, select ``testing``.

. Click btn:[Build] to build version 1 of your project:

Assign clients::
. Navigate to menu:Systems[System List], select the client to assign, and go to the menu:Software[Software Channels] tab.
. In the [guimenu]``Base Channel`` section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to.
  For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the ``production`` environment, assign the base channel ``<CLM_Project_Name>-production-<Channel_Name>``.
  Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to ``development``, so you assign the base channel ``<CLM_Project_Name>-testing-<Channel_Name>``.

. Click btn:[Next] to assign the client.

Promote Environments::
  . In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Content Lifecycle[Projects], and select the project you want to work with.
  . In the [guimenu]``Environment Lifecycle`` section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click btn:[Promote].
    You can monitor build progress in the [guimenu]``Environment Lifecycle`` section.
