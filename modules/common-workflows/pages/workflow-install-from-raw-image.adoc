= Installing {productname} using raw image


{productname} offers various image formats, including a raw format. This guide demonstrates how to set up {productname} Server using the raw image.


== Use Case

RAW images are pre-built, ready-to-use representations of a running operating system. Instead of being installed through a traditional installer, they are directly copied to the hard disk of the target host.
Raw image format is flexible and compatible with a wide range of virtualization and deployment tools. This guide provides essential information about these pre-configured images.


== Outcome 

Successful completion of this workflow results in successful installation of {productname} Server.


== Step-by-step Preparation Instructions


[WARNING]
====
This workflow is complex and time-consuming.
Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment.

.Procedure: Prerequisites
[role=procedure]
. *Download the Image:* Download the architecture-specific [literal]``.raw.xz`` image of SUSE Manager 5.0 Server for your target block size.


. *Make Image Accessible:* Copy the image to a web server (preferred), NFS server, or expand the .raw file to add directly as a disk in a virtual environment (if supported).


. *Boot Media:* Provide a bootable ISO ({sles} 15 SPX or {sle-micro} 5.5) to access the "Rescue System." Add netsetup=1 on the kernel command line for networking, or configure IP via ifcfg.

. *Target Disk Setup:* In VMware, create:
.. A 40GB root disk
.. Additional storage for persistent SUSE Manager data
											
.Procedure: Installation Steps
										
. *Prepare Network and Boot Environment*

.. Create a new instance, attach the root and persistent storage, then attach the {sles} or {sle-micro} ISO as a virtual CD.
.. Boot the instance to the ISO, selecting the “Rescue System.”
.. Add the following on the command line to enable network configuration.

+
----
netsetup=1
----
+
. *Configure Network & Identify Devices*

.. Complete network setup as prompted and log in as root.
.. Use fdisk to confirm the root device name
+
----
fdisk -l
----
+
.. Use a disk storage utility like [literal]``blockdev`` or [literal]``lsblk`` to verify the block size against your downloaded image.
+
----
blockdev --getpbsz /dev/sda
----
+

+
----
lsblk -o NAME,PHY-SEC /dev/sda
----
+
. *Transfer the Image*

.. Use [literal]``curl`` to copy the [literal]``.raw.xz`` image onto the root disk:
+
----
curl -Sks $url | xz -d > $device -v
----
+

.. Replace [literal]``$url``  with the image URL and $device with the root partition device.
							
. *Finalize Boot and Configuration*

.. Power off the instance, remove the virtual CD from the boot sequence, and start it again to boot from the newly created instance.
.. Follow on-screen installation directions and, if needed, register with {scc}, adding the SUSE Manager Server Extension.

. *Install VMware Tools (if applicable)*

.. Install the [literal]``open-vm-tools``
+
----
transactional-update pkg install open-vm-tools
----
+
.. Reboot after installation.

. *Provision Persistent Storage*

+
----
mgr-storage-server $device
----
+
Ensure $device points to the fast, persistent storage added in VMware.
