= Installing {productname} Using RAW Image


{productname} offers various image formats, including a RAW format. 
This guide demonstrates how to set up {productname} Server using the raw image.



== Use Case

RAW images are pre-built, ready-to-use representations of a running operating system. 
Instead of being installed through a traditional installer, they are directly copied to the hard disk of the target host.
RAW image format is flexible and compatible with a wide range of virtualization and deployment tools. 

This guide provides essential information about these pre-configured images.



== Outcome 

Successful completion of this workflow results in successful installation of {productname} Server.



== Step-by-step Instructions

[NOTE]
====
This workflow is complex and time-consuming.
Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment.

.Procedure: Prepare the Prerequisites
[role=procedure]
. *Download the Image:* Download the architecture-specific [literal]``.raw.xz`` image of {productname} Server for your target block size.
. *Make Image Accessible:* Copy the image to a web server (preferred), NFS server, or expand the [literal]``.raw`` file to add directly as a disk in a virtual environment (if supported).
. *Target Disk Setup:* If applicable, in virtual machine hypervisor, create:
.. A 40GB root disk
.. Additional storage for persistent SUSE Manager data

											
.Procedure: Installation Steps
[role=procedure]										
. *Prepare Boot Environment and Network*
.. Provide a bootable ISO ({sles} 15 SPX or {sle-micro} 5.5) to access the "Rescue System."
   Add [literal]``netsetup=1`` on the kernel command line for networking, or configure IP via [command]``ifcfg``.
.. Create a new instance, attach the root and persistent storage, then attach the {sles} or {sle-micro} ISO as a virtual CD.
.. Boot the instance to the ISO, selecting the [literal]``Rescue System``.
.. Add the following on the command line to enable network configuration.
+
----
netsetup=1
----
+
. *Configure Network and Identify Devices*
.. Complete network setup as prompted and log in as root.
.. Use [command]``fdisk`` to confirm the root device name.
+
----
fdisk -l
----
+
.. Use a disk storage utility like [literal]``blockdev`` or [literal]``lsblk`` to verify the block size against your downloaded image.
+
----
blockdev --getpbsz $device
----
+
----
lsblk -o NAME,PHY-SEC /dev/sda
----
+
. *Transfer the Image*
.. Use [literal]``curl`` to copy the [literal]``.raw.xz`` image onto the root disk:
+
----
curl -Sks $url | xz -d > $device -v
----
+
.. Replace [literal]``$url``  with the image URL and [literal]``$device`` with the root partition device.
. *Finalize Boot and Configuration*
.. Power off the instance, remove the virtual CD from the boot sequence, and start it again to boot from the newly created instance.
.. Follow on-screen installation directions and, if needed, register with {scc}, adding the SUSE Manager Server Extension.
. *Install VMware Tools (if applicable)*
.. Install the [literal]``open-vm-tools``
+
----
transactional-update pkg install open-vm-tools
----
+
.. Reboot after installation.
. *Provision Persistent Storage*
+
----
mgr-storage-server $device
----
+
Ensure [literal]``$device`` points to the fast, persistent storage added in VMware.
