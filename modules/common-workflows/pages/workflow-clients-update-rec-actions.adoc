= Clients Update Using Recurring Actions

This workflow shows how to automate updating the clients registered at {productname} using recurring actions.


== Use Case / Situation

Automated update of clients is benefitial when:

* update of a large number of clients is wanted
* the workflow should not be re-done every execution
* a dedicated maintenance window exists.


== Outcome / Resolution

Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent and supportable state.


== Preparation

Before you start, you should have a number of clients onboarded.
It may make sense to have them sorted into groups you want to update together.
In this workflow we use a system group named [literal]``infra-services``.


== Step-by-Step Workflow Instructions

To update a client two steps are required.
A third step is optional but highly recommended to finalize the update process.


.Procedure 1: Creating a Recurring Action to Update {salt} Itself
[role=procedure]
. As an example, we create the action to update {salt} itself as a recurring action for all systems in the organization.
  In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Home[My Organization > Recurring Actions] and click btn:[Create].
. Select [literal]``Action Type`` **Custom State** and enter a [literal]``Schedule Name`` like [literal]``update-salt``.
. Select a schedule.
  For example, ** Weekly: Wednesday, 9:00 am **.
. Assign the [literal]``update-salt`` state by selecting the checkbox.
. Click btn:[Save Changes] to save the action.
. You can edit the execution order of the states if needed.
  Click btn:[Confirm] to confirm the order.
. Click btn:[Create Schedule] to save the action.


.Procedure 2: Creating a Recurring Action to Apply All Available Updates to the Systems
[role=procedure]
. As an example we create the action to apply all updates as a recurring action for a system group called "infra-services".
  In the {productname} {webui} go to menu:Systems[System Groups] and click on [literal]``infra-services``.
. Now go to [literal]``Recurring Actions`` and click btn:[Create].
. Select [literal]``Action Type`` **Custom State** and enter a [literal]``Schedule Name`` like [literal]``full-system-update``.
. Select a Schedule. 
  For example, ** Weekly: Wednesday, 9:30 am **.
  Keep enough time between this action and the [literal]``update-salt`` action.
  The [literal]``update-salt`` actions must be finished on all systems before this action should be executed.
. Assign the states [literal]``util.syncall``, [literal]``certs``, [literal]``channels`` and [literal]``uptodate` by selecting the checkboxes.
. Save the action by clicking btn:[Save Changes].
. You can edit the execution order of the states. 
  The order should be [literal]``util.syncall``, [literal]``certs``, [literal]``channels``, and finally [literal]``uptodate``.
  Click btn:[Confirm] to store the order.
. Click btn:[Create Schedule] to save the action.

[WARNING]
====  
The [literal]``uptodate` also performs a reboot, if an update requests it. 
This reboot be prevented if needed. 
For example, the systems which use live patching need to prevent the rebooting following the update.
====


.Procedure 3: Configuring Systems to Not Reboot After the [literal]``uptodate`` State is Applied
[role=procedure]
. In the {productname} [web ui} go to menu:Systems[Custom System Info] and click btn:[Create Key].
. Enter "mgr_reboot_if_needed" as `Key Label` and set as `Description`.
  Define if the [literal]``uptodate`` state should perform a reboot if needed. 
  Set to [literal]``False`` if this is not wanted.
. Click btn:[Create Key] to store the new key.
. To assign values to multiple systems, navigate in the {productname} {webui} to menu:Systems[Overview] and select the checkbox for all systems you want to modify.
  These system are not in the System Set Manager (SSM).
. Select in the left menu System Set Manager and select menu:Misc[Custom Values] in the tab bar.
. Click [literal]``mgr_reboot_if_needed`` and enter **False** as [literal]``Value``.
. Click btn:[Set Values] to save.


.Procedure 4: Creating a Recurring Action to Run a Highstate After the Update
[role=procedure]
. As an example, we create the action to apply the highstate for the same group which was fully updated before.
  In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and click [literal]``infra-services``.
. Go to `Recurring Actions` and click btn:[Create].
. Select [literal]``Action Type`` **Highstate** and enter a [literal]``Schedule Name`` like [literal]``highstate``.
. Select a Schedule.
  For example, ** Weekly: Wednesday, 10:30 am **.
  Again, keep enough time between this action and the [literal]``full-system-update`` action.
. Click btn:[Create Schedule] to save the action.
