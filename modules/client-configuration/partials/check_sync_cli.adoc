.Procedure: Checking synchronization progress from the command prompt
[role=procedure]
____
. To list available logs before tailing, on the container host, run the following command:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/
----

+

. At the command prompt on the {productname} container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log
----

+

. Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress.
  You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.
