.Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt
. With the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` command you can add the appropriate channels.
  At the command prompt on the {productname} container host, as root, execute the following command.
  Ensure you specify the correct architecture:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-common-channels \
-a <architecture> \
<base_channel_name> \
<child_channel_name_1> \
<child_channel_name_2> \
... <child_channel_name_n>
----
. If xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc#_custom_channel_synchronization[automatic synchronization] is turned off, synchronize the channels on the container host with the following command:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-repo-sync -p <base_channel_label>-<architecture>
----

. Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing.
