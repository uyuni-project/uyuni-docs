[IMPORTANT]
====
The AppStream repository provides modular packages.
This results in the {productname} {webui} showing incorrect package information.
You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the {webui} or API.

Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages on Salt clients, or use the [command]``dnf`` command on the client.
For more information about CLM, see xref:administration:content-lifecycle.adoc[].
