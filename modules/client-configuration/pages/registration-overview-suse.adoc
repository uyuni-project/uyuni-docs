ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
// SUSE Liberty Linux not available at Uyuni for now
You can register {sle} and {sleses} clients to your {productname} Server.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
// SUSE Liberty Linux not available at Uyuni for now
You can register {sle} clients to your {productname} Server.
endif::[]

The method and details varies depending on the operating system of the client.

Before you start, ensure that the client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server.

You must also have created an activation key.
For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not register a {productname} Server to itself.
The {productname} Server must be managed individually or by using another separate {productname} Server.
For more information about using multiple servers, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-multi-server.adoc[].

[[suse-registration-overview-check]]
== Check Previous Registration Status

If the client was registered to SCC, SMT, or RMT previously, remove such a registration with [command]``SUSEConnect`` before migrating the client to {productname} Server.
Do not forget to remove the old registration first.
Otherwise repositories that are no longer needed, will be added to the client after the client has been migrated to a newer version of a {suse} operating system with {productname}.

To de-register a {sle} 12 or 15 client, on the client, as root, execute:

----
SUSEConnect --de-register
SUSEConnect --cleanup
----

For more information about detailed cleanup commands and verification steps, see https://www.suse.com/de-de/support/kb/doc/?id=000019054.
