= Registering {ubuntu} Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {ubuntu} 20.04 LTS operating systems.
For information about registering Salt clients running older {ubuntu} operating systems, including 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, see xref:client-configuration/clients-ubuntu-old.adoc[].

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
{productname} supports {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS, and 20.04 LTS clients using Salt.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
{productname} supports {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS clients using Salt.
endif::[]
Traditional clients are not supported.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Canonical does not endorse or support {productname}.
====

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {ubuntu} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.
However, the root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default, so to use bootstrapping, you will require an existing user with [command]``sudo`` privileges for Python.



== Prepare to Register

Some preparation is required before you can register {ubuntu} clients to the {productname} Server.

.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels

Before you begin, ensure you have the {ubuntu} product enabled, and have synchronized the {ubuntu} channels for {scc}:

You can do this from {webui} or using command prompt, at your choice.

For {ubuntu} 20.04:

* From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``Ubuntu 20.04`` and [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Client Tools Ubuntu 2004 amd64``.
* From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``ubuntu-20.04-pool-amd64`` and [systemitem]``ubuntu-20.04-suse-manager-tools-amd64``.

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Channel List > All].
Verify that you have a base channel and a child channel for your architecture.

For example, for {ubuntu} 20.04:

* Base channel: [systemitem]``ubuntu-2004-amd64-main for amd64``
* Child channel: [systemitem]``Ubuntu-20.04-SUSE-Manager-Tools for amd64``


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
.Procedure: Adding the {ubuntu} Channels

. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, add the {ubuntu} channels.

For {ubuntu} 20.04:
----
spacewalk-common-channels \
ubuntu-2004-pool-amd64-uyuni \
ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-uyuni \
ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-updates-uyuni \
ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-security-uyuni \
ubuntu-2004-amd64-universe-uyuni \
ubuntu-2004-amd64-universe-updates-uyuni \
ubuntu-2004-amd64-uyuni-client
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
You need all the new channels fully synchronized, including Universe (Universe contains important dependencies for Salt), before bootstrapping any Ubuntu client.
====
endif::[]


[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====



== Monitor Synchronization Progress

There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``Products`` tab.
+
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], then click the channel associated to the repository.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, then click [guimenu]``Sync`` and check [systemitem]``Sync Status``.
endif::[]
* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt:
+
----
tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log
----
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.


You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

By default, {ubuntu} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {ubuntu} client tools.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.

However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

To fix this, add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all {ubuntu} bootstrap scripts:
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----

You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are bootstrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key.
Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.
endif::[]



== Root Access

The root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default.
You can enable it by editing the [filename]``sudoers`` file.

.Procedure: Granting Root User Access

. On the client, edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line to the [filename]``sudoers`` file. Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that will be used to bootstrap the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>  ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3
----

[NOTE]
====
This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client.
When the client is successfully installed it will run with root privileges, so the access is no longer required.
We recommend that you remove the line from the [path]``sudoers`` file after the client has been successfully installed.
====



== Register Clients

To register your {ubuntu} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
