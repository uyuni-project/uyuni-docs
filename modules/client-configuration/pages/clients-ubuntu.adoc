= Registering {ubuntu} 20.04 Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {ubuntu} 20.04 LTS operating systems.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
{productname} supports {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS, and 20.04 LTS clients using Salt.
For information about registering Salt clients running {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS, see xref:client-configuration:clients-ubuntu-old.adoc[].
endif::[]

Traditional clients are not supported.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Canonical does not endorse or support {productname}.
====

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {ubuntu} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.
However, the root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default, so to use bootstrapping, you will require an existing user with [command]``sudo`` privileges for Python.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {ubuntu} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {ubuntu} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

The products you need for this procedure are:

.Ubuntu Products - WebUI
|===
| OS Version
| Product Name
| Security Channel
| Updates Channel
| Universe Channel

| Ubuntu 20.04
| ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-security for amd64
| ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-updates for amd64

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need all the new channels fully synchronized, including Universe (Universe contains important dependencies for Salt), before bootstrapping any Ubuntu client.

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.

== Root Access

The root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default.
You can enable it by editing the [filename]``sudoers`` file.

.Procedure: Granting Root User Access

. On the client, edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line to the [filename]``sudoers`` file. Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that will be used to bootstrap the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>  ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3
----

[NOTE]
====
This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client.
When the client is successfully installed it will run with root privileges, so the access is no longer required.
We recommend that you remove the line from the [path]``sudoers`` file after the client has been successfully installed.
====



== Register Clients

To register your {ubuntu} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
