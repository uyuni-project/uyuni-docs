= Registering {ubuntu} Clients
:revdate: 2025-08-18
:page-revdate: {revdate}

This section contains information about registering clients running {ubuntu} operating systems.

// Use list format: repository URLs / packages and metadata / version info
[IMPORTANT]
====
* {ubuntu} repository URLs are available from {scc}.
* Packages and metadata are provided by Ubuntu, not by {suse}.
* Canonical does not endorse or support {productname}.
* For supported products, see the release notes and the support table at xref:client-configuration:supported-features-ubuntu.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} is supported for {salt} clients only.
Traditional clients are not supported.
====

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {ubuntu} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.
However, the root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default, so to use bootstrapping, you require an existing user with [command]``sudo`` privileges for Python.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {ubuntu} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

include::snippets/arch-other-note.adoc[]


The products you need for this procedure are:

[[ubuntu-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Ubuntu Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version     | Product Name
| {ubuntu} 24.04 | Ubuntu 24.04
| {ubuntu} 22.04 | Ubuntu 22.04
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[ubuntu-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Ubuntu Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version     | Base Channel
| {ubuntu} 24.04 | ubuntu-2404-amd64-main-amd64
| {ubuntu} 22.04 | ubuntu-2204-amd64-main-amd64
|===

== Check Synchronization Status

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====



== Manage GPG Keys

Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed.
Only trusted software can be installed on clients.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients.
It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted.
A software channel cannot be assigned to a client when the GPG key is not trusted.
====

For more information about GPG keys, see xref:client-configuration:gpg-keys.adoc[].


== Root Access

The root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default for SSH access.

To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file.

[NOTE]
====
This issue happens with self-installed versions of {ubuntu}.
If the default user has been granted administrative privileges during installation time, a password is required to perform privilege escalation using [command]``sudo``.
With cloud instances this does not happen because [command]``cloud-init`` automatically creates a file under [path]``/etc/sudoers.d`` and grants privilege escalation through [command]``sudo`` without the need for a password.
====



=== Grant Root User Access

.Procedure: Granting Root User Access

. On the client, edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line at the end of the [filename]``sudoers`` file.
Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>  ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python
----

[NOTE]
====
This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client.
When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required.
We recommend that you remove the line from the [path]``sudoers`` file after the client has been successfully installed.
====



=== Bootstrap as Install-created User via SSH

To bootstrap an Ubuntu client via SSH you must add the install-created user to the sudo group.
Then run the bootstrap script from the client.

.Procedure: Adding Install-created User to sudo Group and Bootstrapping via SSH

. On the client, as root, run from the command line (replace [literal]``<username>`` with the name of the install-created user):
+

----
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
----

. Bootstrap the client system from its command line (replace [literal]``<SERVER_FQDN>`` with the fully qualified domain name of the {productname} Server):
+

----
sudo su -
curl -Sks https://<SERVER_FQDN>/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-script.sh | /bin/bash
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ubuntu} can only be bootstrapped using the corresponding {ubuntu} bootstrap script run from the client system's command line after issuing [command]``sudo su -`` as above.
It cannot be bootstrapped via the {productname} {webui} due to the fact that the root user is disabled on {ubuntu} by default, and that the {webui} does not permit for privilege escalation of the {ubuntu} install-created user.
