== Cloned Salt Clients

If you have used your hypervisor clone utility, and attempted to register the cloned Salt client, you might get this error:

----
We're sorry, but the system could not be found.
----

This is caused by the new, cloned, system having the same machine ID as an existing, registered, system.
You can adjust this manually to correct the error and register the cloned system successfully.


For more information and instructions, see xref:administration:tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].



== Mounting /tmp with noexec

Salt runs remote commands from [filename]``/tmp`` of the client's filesystem.
Therefore you must not mount [filename]``/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.



== SSL errors

On {slsa}{nbsp}11 systems, clients can sometimes have SSL errors which make some operations unusable, including package management and bootstrapping.
In this case, you will see an error like this:

----
Repository 'SLES11-SP4-SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64' is invalid.
[|] Valid metadata not found at specified URL(s)
Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.
Skipping repository 'SLES11-SP4-SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64' because of the above error.
Download (curl) error for 'www.example.com':
Error code: Unrecognized error
Error message: error:1409442E:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:tlsv1 alert protocol version
----

This occurs because Apache requires TLS{nbsp}v1.2, but older versions of {slsa} do not support this version of the TLS protocol.
To fix this error, you need to force Apache to accept a greater range of protocol versions.
Open the [path]``/etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf`` configuration file, locate the [systemitem]``SSLProtocol`` line, and update it to read:

----
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
----

This will need to be done manually on the Server, and with a Salt state on the Proxy.
Restart the [systemitem]``apache`` service on each system after making the changes.
