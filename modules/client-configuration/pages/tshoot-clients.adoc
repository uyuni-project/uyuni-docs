== Autoinstallation

Depending on your base channel, new autoinstallation profiles might be subscribed to a channel that is missing required packages.

For autoinstallation to work, these packages are required:

* [package]``pyOpenSSL``
* [package]``rhnlib``
* [package]``libxml2-python``
* [package]``spacewalk-koan``

To resolve this issue, check these things first:

* Check that the tools software channel related to the base channel in your autoinstallation profile is available to your organization and your user.
* Check that the tools channel is available to your {productname} as a child channel.
* Check that the required packages and any dependencies are available in the associated channels.



== Bare Metal Systems

If a bare metal system on the network is not automatically added to the [guilabel]``Systems`` list, check these things first:

* You must have the [path]``pxe-default-image`` package installed.
* File paths and parameters must be configured correctly. Check that the [path]``vmlinuz0`` and [path]``initrd0.img`` files, which are provided by [path]``pxe-default-image``, are in the locations specified in the [path]``rhn.conf`` configuration file.
* Ensure the networking equipment connecting the bare metal system to the {productname} server is working correctly, and that you can reach the {productname} server IP address from the server.
* The bare metal system to be provisioned must have PXE booting enabled in the boot sequence, and must not be attempting to boot an operating system.
* The DHCP server must be responding to DHCP requests during boot. Check the PXE boot messages to ensure that:
** the DHCP server is assigning the expected IP address
** the DHCP server is assigning the the {productname} server IP address as [option]``next-server`` for booting.
* Ensure Cobbler is running, and that the Discovery feature is enabled.

If you see a blue Cobbler menu shortly after booting, discovery has started.
If it does not complete successfully, temporarily disable automatic shutdown to help diagnose the problem. To disable automatic shutdown:

. Select [option]``pxe-default-profile`` in the Cobbler menu with the arrow keys, and press the Tab key before the timer expires.
. Add the kernel boot parameter [option]``spacewalk-finally=running`` using the integrated editor, and press Enter to continue booting.
. Enter a shell with the username [option]``root`` and password [option]``linux`` to continue debugging.

[IMPORTANT]
.Duplicate profiles
====
Due to a technical limitation, it is not possible to reliably distinguish a new bare metal system from a system that has previously been discovered.
Therefore, we recommended that you do not power on bare metal systems multiple times, as this will result in duplicate profiles.
====


== Cloned Salt Clients

If you have used your hypervisor clone utility, and attempted to register the cloned Salt client, you might get this error:

----
We're sorry, but the system could not be found.
----

This is caused by the new, cloned, system having the same machine ID as an existing, registered, system.
You can adjust this manually to correct the error and register the cloned system successfully.


For more information and instructions, see xref:administration:tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].



== Disabling the FQDNS grain

The FQDNS grain returns the list of all the fully-qualified DNS services in the system.
Collecting this information is usually a fast process, but if the DNS settings have been misconfigured, it could take a much longer time.
In some cases, the client could become unresponsive, or crash.

To prevent this problem, you can disable the FQDNS grain with a Salt flag.
If you disable the grain, you can use a network module to provide FQDNS services, without the risk of the client becoming unresponsive.

[NOTE]
====
This only applies to older Salt clients.
If you registered your Salt client recently, the FQDNS grain is disabled by default.
====


On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, use this command to disable the FQDNS grain:

----
salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_disable_fqdns_grain
----

This command restarts each client and generate Salt events that the server needs to process.
If you have a large number of clients, you can execute the command in batch mode instead:

----
salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_disable_fqdns_grain
----

Wait for the batch command to finish executing.
Do not interrupt the process with kbd:[Ctrl+C].



== Mounting /tmp with noexec

Salt runs remote commands from [filename]``/tmp`` on the client's file system.
Therefore you must not mount [filename]``/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.



== Passing Grains to a Start Event

Every time a Salt client starts, it passes the ``machine_id`` grain to {productname}. {productname} uses this grain to determine if the client is registered.
This process requires a synchronous Salt call. Synchronous Salt calls block other processes, so if you have a lot of clients start at the same time, the process could create significant delays.

To overcome this problem, a new feature has been introduced in Salt to avoid making a separate synchronous Salt call.

To use this feature, you can add a configuration parameter to the client configuration, on clients that support it.

To make this process easier, you can use the ``mgr_start_event_grains.sls`` helper Salt state.

[NOTE]
====
This only applies to already registered clients.
If you registered your Salt client recently, this config parameter is added by default.
====


On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, use this command to enable the ``start_event_grains`` configuration helper:

----
salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_start_event_grains
----

This command adds the required configuration into the client's configuration file, and applies it when the client is restarted.
If you have a large number of clients, you can execute the command in batch mode instead:

----
salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls mgr_start_event_grains
----



== Proxy Connections and FQDN

Sometimes clients connected through a {productname} Proxy appear in the {webui}, but do not show that they are connected through a proxy.
This can occur if you are not using the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to connect, and the proxy is not known to {productname}.

To correct this behavior, specify additional FQDNs as grains in the client configuration file on the proxy:

----
grains:
  susemanager:
    custom_fqdns:
      - name.one
      - name.two
----



== Registering Older Clients

//
//LKB 2020-06-03

//CCFR for reference:

//* Cause: To register older clients ({centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, or {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients), the server needs to support older types of SSL encryption, to successfully register them.

//* Consequence: When trying to register on the CLI, registration fails with this error:
//+
//----
//Repository '<Repository_Name>' is invalid.
//[|] Valid metadata not found at specified URL(s)
//Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.
//Skipping repository '<Repository_Name>' because of the above error.
//Download (curl) error for 'www.example.com':
//Error code: Unrecognized error
//Error message: error:1409442E:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:tlsv1 alert protocol version
//----
//+
//When trying to register on the {webui}, registration fails with this error:
//+
//----

//* Fix: Before registering {centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, or {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients, force Apache to accept a greater range of protocol versions.
//Open the [path]``/etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf`` configuration file, locate the [systemitem]``SSLProtocol`` line, and update it to read:
//+
//----
//SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
//----
//+
//This must be done manually on the server, and with a Salt state on the Proxy, if applicable.
//Restart the [systemitem]``apache`` service on each system after making the changes.

//* Result: the client is successfully registered

To register and use {centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, or {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.

If you are attempting to register at the command prompt, you will see an error like this:

----
Repository '<Repository_Name>' is invalid.
[|] Valid metadata not found at specified URL(s)
Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.
Skipping repository '<Repository_Name>' because of the above error.
Download (curl) error for 'www.example.com':
Error code: Unrecognized error
Error message: error:1409442E:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:tlsv1 alert protocol version
----

If you are attempting to register in the {webui}, you will see an error like this:

----
Rendering SLS 'base:bootstrap' failed: Jinja error: >>> No TLS 1.2 and above for RHEL6 and SLES11. Please check your Apache config.
...
----

This occurs because Apache requires TLS{nbsp}v1.2, but older operating systems do not support this version of the TLS protocol.
To fix this error, you need to force Apache on the server to accept a greater range of protocol versions.
On the {productname} Server, as root, open the [path]``/etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf`` configuration file, locate the [systemitem]``SSLProtocol`` line, and update it to read:

----
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
----

This will need to be done manually on the server, and with a Salt state on the Proxy, if applicable.
Restart the [systemitem]``apache`` service on each system after making the changes.
