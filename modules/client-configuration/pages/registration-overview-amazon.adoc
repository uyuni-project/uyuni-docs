= {amazon} Client Registration

You can register {amazon} clients to your {productname} Server.
The method and details vary depending on the operating system of the client.

Before you start, ensure that the client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server.

[WARNING]
====
{amazon} instances always have the same `machine-id` id at `/etc/machine-id`.
Make sure you regenerate the `machine-id` after the instance is created.
For more information, see xref:administration:tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].

You must also have created an activation key.
For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
