= Software Channels


Channels are a method of grouping software packages.
In {productname}, channels are divided into base channels and child channels.
Organizing channels in this way ensures that only compatible packages are installed on each system.

A base channel consists of packages built for a specific operating system type, version, and architecture.
For example, all of the packages in {sles}{nbsp}12 for the `x86_64` architecture make up a base channel.
The list of packages in {sles}{nbsp}12 for the `s390x` architecture make up a different base channel.
A system must be subscribed to only one base channel, which is assigned automatically during registration based on the {sle} release and system architecture.
For paid channels provided by a vendor, you must have an associated subscription.

A child channel is associated with a specific base channel and provides only packages that are compatible with that base channel.
A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel.
When a system has been assigned to a base channel, it is only possible for that system to install the related child channels.
For example, if a system has been assigned to the {sles}{nbsp}12 `x86_64` base channel, they will only be able to install or update packages compatible with {sles}{nbsp}12 `x86_64`.

In the {productname} {webui} you can browse your available channels by navigating to menu:Software[Channel List > All].
You can modify or create new channels by navigating to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].

In addition, [guimenu]``Per-User Subscription Restrictions`` can be set globally by {productname} administrators and channel administrators.
By default, any user can subscribe channels to a system.
To manage user permissions, select [guimenu]``Only selected users within your organization may subscribe to this channel`` and click btn:[Update].
The [guimenu]``Subscribers`` tab appears.
Click it to grant specific users subscription permissions to a channel.
{productname} administrators and channel administrators can always subscribe any channels to a system.

Only customers with custom base channels can change their systems' base channel assignments via the {productname} Web interface in two ways:

* Assign the system to a custom base channel.
* Revert subscriptions from a custom base channel to the appropriate distribution-based base channel.

[NOTE]
====
The assigned base channel must match the installed system.
For example, a system running {sle}{nbsp}11 for `x86_64` cannot be registered to a {sle}{nbsp}12 for `s390x` base channel.
Use the files [path]``/etc/os-release`` or [path]``/etc/SuSE-release`` to check your product, architecture (try [command]``uname -a``), version, and patch level.

== Custom Channels

If you require packages that are not provided by the standard {productname} base channels, you can create custom channels.
{productname} Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority, which gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels.

For more on creating custom channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].
