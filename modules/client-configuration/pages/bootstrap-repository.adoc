= Bootstrap Repository

A bootstrap repository contains required packages for registering Salt or traditional clients during bootstrapping, as well as packages for installing Salt on clients.
When products are synchronized, bootstrap repositories are automatically created and regenerated on the {productname} Server.


== Prepare to Create a Bootstrap Repository

When you select a product for synchronization, the bootstrap repository is automatically created as soon as all mandatory channels are fully mirrored.

== Options for Automatic Mode

You can change how the automated bootstrap repository creation works.
This section details the various settings.



.Flush Mode::
Flush Mode::
By default, existing repositories are updated only with the latest packages.
You can configure it to always start with an empty repository instead.
To enable this behavior, add or edit this value in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_flush = 1
----


.Automatic Mode::
Automatic Mode::

By default, automated regeneration of the bootstrap repositories is enabled.
To disable it, add or edit this value in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
server.susemanager.auto_generate_bootstrap_repo = 0
----



=== Configure Bootstrap Data File

The tool uses a data file with information about which packages are required for each distribution.
The data file is stored at [path]``/usr/share/susemanager/mgr_bootstrap_data.py``.
{suse} updates this file regularly.
If you want to makes changes to this file, do not edit it directly.
Instead, create a copy in the same directory and edit your copy:

----
cd /usr/share/susemanager/
cp mgr_bootstrap_data.py my_data.py
----

When you have made your changes, configure {productname} to use the new file.
Add or edit this value in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_datamodule = my_data
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
On the next update, the new data from {suse} overwrites the original data file, not the new one.
You need to keep the new file up to date with changes provided by {suse}.
====



== Manually Generate a Bootstrap Repository

By default, bootstrap repositories are regenerated daily.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt.



.Procedure: Generating the Bootstrap Repository for {sle}
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, list the available distributions to create bootstrap repositories for:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l
----
. Create the bootstrap repository, using the appropriate repository name as the product label:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64
----
+
. Alternatively, use the number shown next to the distribiution name in the list of available distributions.


The client repository is located in [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/``.



If you have mirrored more than one product (for example, SLES and SLES for SAP), or if you use custom channels, you might need to specify the parent channel to use when creating the bootstrap repository.
This is not required in every situation.
For example, some SLES{nbsp}15 versions have common code bases, so there is no need to specify a parent channel.
Use this procedure only if your environment requires it.



.OPTIONAL Procedure: Specifying a Parent Channel for a Bootstrap Repository
. Check which parent channels you have available:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64
Multiple options for parent channel found. Please use option
--with-parent-channel <label> and choose one of:
- sle-product-sles15-pool-x86_64
- sle-product-sles_sap15-pool-x86_64
- sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64
----
. Specify the appropriate parent channel:
+
----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 --with-parent-channel sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64
----



=== Repositories with Multiple Architectures


If you are creating bootstrap repositories that include multiple different architectures, you need to be careful that all architectures are updated correctly.
For example, the {x86_64} and {ibmz} architectures for {slea} use the same bootstrap repository URL at ``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/sle/15/2/bootstrap/``.

When the ``flush`` option is enabled, and you attempt to generate the bootstrap repository for multiple architectures, only one architecture is generated.
To avoid this, use the ``--no-flush`` option at the command prompt when creating additional architectures.
For example:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-SP2-x86_64
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --no-flush -c SLE-15-SP2-s390x
----



== Bootstrap and Custom Channels

If you are using custom channels, you can use the [option]``--with-custom-channels`` option with the [command]``mgr-create-bootstrap-repo`` command.
In this case, you also need to specify the parent channel to use.

Automatic creation of a bootstrap repository might fail if you are using custom channels.
In this case, you need to create the repository manually.

For more information about custom channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].



=== Create Bootstrap Repository for SUSE Liberty Linux 9
////
// https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1207809
// https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/issues/20464
// We can either add it here or to all "Register Clients" sections in
// the clients-xxx.adoc files

When creating the bootstrap repository for SUSE Liberty Linux 9-x86_64 the only file that is added is the salt bundle:

Creating bootstrap repo for SUSE-LibertyLinux9-x86_64
copy 'venv-salt-minion-3004-1.3.3.x86_64'
Directory walk started
Directory walk done - 1 packages
Temporary output repo path: /srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/res/9/bootstrap.tmp/.repodata/
Preparing sqlite DBs
Pool started (with 5 workers)
Pool finished
////

When creating the bootstrap repository for SUSE Liberty Linux 9 

This means that customers must use the --force-switch with mgr-bootstrap or modify the bootstrap to use the salt bundle:

# Avoid installing venv-salt-minion instead salt-minion
# even if it available in the bootstrap repo
AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION=0

# Force installing venv-salt-minion instead salt-minion
# even if it is NOT available in the bootstrap repo
FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION=1

Otherwise they will encounter an issue where the salt and salt-minions are not available when they try to bootstrap.
