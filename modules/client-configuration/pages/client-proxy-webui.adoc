= Register Clients to a Proxy in the {webui}

You can register Salt clients to a {productname} Proxy using the {webui}.


[NOTE]
====
A bootstrap repository is needed for non-SLE clients in general and for SLE clients before versionÂ 15.
A bootstrap offers packages for installing Salt on clients and for registering Salt or traditional clients.
For information about creating a bootstrap repository, see xref:client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc[].

.Procedure: Registering Clients to a Proxy in the {webui}

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, type the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, type the SSH port number that will be used to connect and bootstrap the client.
By default, the SSH  port is [systemitem]``22``.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, type the username to log in to the client.
By default, the username is [systemitem]``root``.
. In the [guimenu]``Authentication Method`` field, select the authentication method to use for bootstrapping the client.
+
* For password authentication, in the [guimenu]``Password`` field, type password to log in to the client.
* For SSH Private key authentication, enter the private key and the associated passphrase.
The key is only stored for as long as the bootstrapping process takes to complete.
. In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` field, select the activation key that is associated with the software channel you want to use to bootstrap the client.
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy`` field, select the proxy server you want to register to.
. By default, the [guimenu]``Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking`` checkbox is selected.
This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate.
. OPTIONAL: Check the [guimenu]``Manage System Completely via SSH`` checkbox.
If you check this option, the client will be configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other connection method will be configured.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap] to begin registration.

When the bootstrap process has completed, your client will be listed at menu:Systems[System List].
