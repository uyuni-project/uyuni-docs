= Register Clients to a Proxy

////
The following sections cover registering Salt and traditional clients on the {productname} Proxy.
When a client is registered it connect to the proxy exclusively for Salt operations (Salt client) and normal HTTP package downloads.
There are three ways to register Salt clients.

Proxy servers can act as a broker and package cache for both Salt and traditional clients.
Registering clients to a proxy is similar to registering them directly to the {productname} Server, with a few key differences.

These sections contain information on registering Salt clients to a proxy using the {webui}, commands on the command line, or a bootstrap script.
There is also information on registering traditional clients using a bootstrap script.

// Here starts what you can see on the server about proxy connected clients

Within the {webui}, proxy pages show information about both Salt and traditional clients.
You can see a list of clients that are connected to a proxy by clicking the name of the proxy in menu:Systems[System List > Proxy], then select the [guimenu]``Proxy`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab.

A list of chained proxies for a Salt client can be seen by clicking the name of the client in menu:Systems[All], then select the [guimenu]``Connection`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab.

If you decide to move any of your clients between proxies or the server you need to repeat the registration process from the beginning.
