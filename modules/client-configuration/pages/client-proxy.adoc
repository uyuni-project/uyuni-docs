= Register Clients to a Proxy

////
The following sections cover registering Salt and traditional clients on the {productname} Proxy.
When a client is registered it connect to the proxy exclusively for Salt operations (Salt client) and normal HTTP package downloads.
There are three ways to register Salt clients.
////


Proxy servers can act as a broker and package cache for both Salt and traditional clients.
Registering clients to a proxy is similar to registering them directly to the {productname} Server, with a few key differences.

These sections contain information on registering Salt clients to a proxy using the {webui}, commands on the command line, or a bootstrap script.
There is also information on registering traditional clients using a bootstrap script.
There are also procedures how you can move clients from one {productname} Proxy to another one or to the {productname} Server.

// Here starts what you can see on the server about proxy connected clients

Within the {webui}, proxy pages show information about both Salt and traditional clients.
You can see a list of clients that are connected to a proxy by clicking the name of the proxy in menu:Systems[System List > Proxy], then select the [guimenu]``Proxy`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab.

A list of chained proxies for a Salt client can be seen by clicking the name of the client in menu:Systems[All], then select the [guimenu]``Connection`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Details`` tab.



== Move Clients between Proxies

You can move Salt and Salt SSH push clients between proxies without the need to repeat the registration process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot move chained proxies.
Instead of moving a chained proxy, create a new proxy, move the clients, and delete the old proxy.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you want to move a traditional client between proxies, you must repeat the registration process from the beginning.

.Procedure: Moving Salt or  Salt SSH Push Client between Proxies

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to the [guimenu]``System Details`` page for the client you want to move between proxies.
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Connection`` tab.
  Then follow the [guimenu]``Change proxy`` link to see the drop-down menu.
. From the [guimenu]``New Proxy`` drop-down menu select the proxy you want the client to move to, and click btn:[Change Proxy].



.Procedure: Moving Multiple Salt or Salt SSH Push Clients between Proxies with SSM

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and check each client to move, this adds the clients to the system set manager.
. Navigate to menu:Systems[System Set Manager], and go to the menu:Misc[Proxy]`` tab.
. From the [guimenu]``New Proxy`` drop-down menu select the proxy you want the clients to move to, and click btn:[Change Proxy].



The same functionality is also available with the [systemitem]``system.changeProxy`` API call.



=== Background Information
The effect of this function differs between normal Salt clients and Salt SSH push clients.


==== Normal Salt Clients

The function schedules a Salt state action, which modifies [literal]``master:`` setting in the [path]``susemanager.conf`` Salt client configuration file to point to the new proxy.
Then the function restarts the Salt client.

[NOTE]
====
Changing [literal]``master:`` by manually editing the [path]``susemanager.conf`` file has the same effect and is supported, too.
====

When the minion restarts and reconnects via the new proxy, the server updates the proxy path in the database and schedules another action for refreshing the channel URLs.



==== Salt SSH Push Clients

The function updates the proxy path immediately in the database and new action
for refreshing the channel URLs is scheduled.



== Move Clients from Proxies to the Server

If you want to move a Salt client from a proxy to the server, select [literal]``None`` from proxy list.

If you want to move a traditional client to the server you must repeat the registration process from the beginning.
