[[autoinst-distributions]]
= Autoinstallable Distributions

The autoinstallation process relies on an several files to initiate the installation.
These files include the Linux kernel, an initial RAM disk, and other files required to boot the operating system in installation mode.

You can extract the needed files from a DVD image.
For information, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-distributions.adoc#based-on-iso-image[Distribution Based on an ISO Image].

Alternatively, you can install the [package]``tftpboot-installation`` package.
For information, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-distributions.adoc#based-on-rpm-package[Distribution Based on a RPM Package].

You must also have a base channel synchronized on your {productname} Server for the same operating system version as those files.

When you have the files ready, and the base channel synchronized, you need to declare the distribution.
This operation associates the installation files to the base channel.
The distribution can be referred to by one or more installation profiles.
For information, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-distributions.adoc#declare-distribution[Declare an Autoinstallable Distribution].



[[based-on-iso-image]]
== Distribution Based on an ISO Image

This method assumes you have installation media for the operating system you want to install on the clients.
This is usually a DVD [path]``.iso`` image that contains the Linux kernel, an [path]``initrd`` file, and other files required to boot the operating system in installation mode.



.Procedure: Importing Files from Installation Media
. Copy the installation media to your {productname} Server.
  For {suse} operating systems, you can download installation media from https://www.suse.com/download/.
. Loop-mount the ISO image, and copy its contents somewhere:
+
----
# mount -o loop,ro <image_name>.iso /mnt
# mkdir -p /srv/www/distributions
# cp -a /mnt /srv/www/distributions/<image_name>
# umount /mnt
----
+

. Take a note of the file path.
You will need it when you declare the distribution to {productname}.



[[based-on-rpm-package]]
== Distribution Based on a RPM Package

This method works on {suse} systems.
It is simpler than importing contents from an installation media, because it uses prepackaged files for your installation system.



.Procedure: Extracting Files from an Installation Package
. On the {productname} Server, install the package whose name starts with [package]``tftpboot-installation``.
  You can determine its exact name with the command [command]``zypper se tftpboot-installation``
. Determine where the installation files went with the command [command]``ls -d /usr/share/tftpboot-installation/*``.
  Take a note of the file path.
  You will need it when you declare the distribution to {productname}.

This procedure prepares the installation of the same operating system version as the one that powers your {productname} Server.
If you want to install a different operating system or version on the client, you need to manually get the package [package]``tftpboot-installation-*`` from the distribution it belongs to.
In the [menu]``Package Search`` input box {productname}, search the packages whose names start with [package]``tftpboot-installation``, then look at the package's details.
They show the local path below [path]``/var/spacewalk/``.



[[declare-distribution]]
== Declare an Autoinstallable Distribution

The next step after extracting the autoinstallation files is to declare an autoinstallable distribution.



.Procedure: Declaring an Autoinstallable Distribution
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Distributions].
. Click [guimenu]``Create Distribution``, and complete these fields:
+
* In the [guimenu]``Distribution Label`` field, enter a name to identify your autoinstallable distribution.
* In the [guimenu]``Tree Path`` field, enter the path to the installation media saved on your {productname} Server.
* Select the matching [guimenu]``Base Channel``.
  This must match the installation media.
* Select the [guimenu]``Installer Generation``.
  This must match the installation media.
* OPTIONAL: Specify kernel options to use when booting this distribution.
  There are multiple ways to provide kernel options.
  Only add options here that are generic for the distribution.
. Click btn:[Create Autoinstallable Distribution].

The installation files that you prepared might not contain the packages you need to install.
If they are not included, add [option]``useonlinerepo=1`` to the [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` field.

The package repositories contain metadata that can be unsigned.
If the metadata is unsigned, add [option]``insecure=1`` to the [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` field, or use your own GPG key as explained in xref:client-configuration:autoinst-owngpgkey.adoc[Use Your Own GPG Key].

These kernel options are needed for example when you use the "online installer" ISO images instead of the full DVD, or when you use the [package]``tpboot-installation`` package.

Navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Distributions] to manage your autoinstallable distributions.

[NOTE]
====
You can autoinstall {productname} Proxies in the same way as {sle} clients.
Make sure you use the {sle} installation media, and choose the [guimenu]``SLE-Product-SUSE-Manager-Proxy-4.2-Pool for x86_64`` base channel.
