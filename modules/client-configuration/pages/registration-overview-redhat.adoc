You can register {rhel} clients to your {productname} Server using either the {redhat} content delivery network (CDN), or {redhat} update infrastructure (RHUI).
The method and details varies depending on the operating system of the client.

Before you start, ensure that the client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server.

You must also have created an activation key.
