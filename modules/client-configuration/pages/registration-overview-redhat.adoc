= Red Hat Client Registration

You can register {rhel} clients to your {productname} Server using either the {redhat} content delivery network (CDN), or {redhat} update infrastructure (RHUI).
The method and details varies depending on the operating system of the client.

Before you start, ensure that the client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server.

You must also have created an activation key.

* For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
* For more information about migrating {rhel} to {sll}, see xref:client-configuration:clients-sleses.adoc#clients-sleses-el-migration[].
