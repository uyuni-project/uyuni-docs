= Client Registration with Salt Bundle

The registration method with the Salt bundle is the recommended registration method as long as it covers your use case.
This section explains the advantages and limitations of the current implementation.
The Salt bundle is provided as the [package]``venv-salt-minion`` that consists of Salt, Python, and the Python modules Salt depends on.
Bootstrapping with {webui} still requires Python to be installed on the client.
// per feedback: this sentence need clarification if we want to keep it:
// Using the Salt bundle, in most cases it is no longer needed that the client provides the required Python version or any Python modules.

If you bootstrap new clients, registration with the Salt bundle is the default method.
You can switch existing clients to the Salt bundle method.
If you switch, the [package]``salt-minion`` package and its Python version and the Python modules will stay installed.

The Salt state [literal]``util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion`` is available to switch from [package]``salt-minion`` to [package]``venv-salt-minion``.
It is recommended to switch to [package]``venv-salt-minion`` in two steps to avoid trouble with shifting processes:

.Procedure: Switching with [literal]``util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion`` state to [package]``venv-salt-minion``

. Apply [literal]``util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion`` with no pillar specified first.
  This will result in the switch to [package]``venv-salt-minion`` with copying configuration files etc.
  It will not clean up the original [package]``salt-minion`` configurations and its packages.
. Apply [literal]``util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion`` with [literal]``mgr_purge_non_venv_salt`` set to [literal]``True`` to remove [package]``salt-minion`` and with [literal]``mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files`` set to [literal]``True`` to remove all the files related to [package]``salt-minion``.
This second step repeats the first step, and then removes the old configuration files and the now obsolete [package]``salt-minion`` package.

On the other hand, it is also possible to avoid installing the Salt bundle and keep using [package]``salt-minion`` instead.
In this case specify one of these options:

* Execute [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` with  [option]``--no-bundle`` option.
* Set [literal]``AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION`` to [literal]``1`` in the generated bootstrap script.
* For bootstrap state set the [literal]``mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion`` pillar to  [literal]``True``.
