= Virtualization with Nutanix

You can use Nutanix AHV virtual machines, with {productname} by setting up a virtual host manager (VHM).

To begin, you will need to set up a VHM on your {productname} Server, and inventory the available VM hosts.


== VHM Setup


The Virtual Host Manager (VHM) runs on the {productname} Server.

Ensure you have installed the [systemitem]``virtual-host-gatherer-Nutanix`` package on the {productname} Server.

To run a VHM, your {productname} Server must have port 9440 open to access the Nutanix Prism Element API.


.Procedure: Creating a Nutanix VHM

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers].
. Click btn:[Create] and select [guimenu]``Nutanix AHV``.
. In the [guimenu]``Add a Nutanix AHV Virtual Host Manager`` section, use these parameters:
* In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, type a custom name for your VHM.
* In the [guimenu]``Hostname`` field, type the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or host IP address.
* In the [guimenu]``Port`` field, type the Prism Element API port to use (for example, [parameter]``9440``).
* In the [guimenu]``Username`` field, type the username associated with the VM host.
* In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, type the password associated with the VM host user.
. Click btn:[Create] to save your changes and create the VHM.
. On the [guimenu]``Virtual Host Managers`` page select the new VHM.
. On the [guimenu]``Properties`` page, click btn:[Refresh Data] to inventory the new VHM.

To see which objects and resources have been inventoried, navigate to menu:Systems[System List > Virtual Systems].


[NOTE]
====
Connecting to the Nutanix Prism API server from a browser using HTTPS can sometimes log an ``invalid certificate`` error.
If this occurs, refreshing the data from the virtual host manager will fail.
A valid SSL certificate (not self-signed) is required on your Nutanix API server.
If you're using a custom CA authority for you Nutanix SSL certificate, please copy the custom CA certificate to [path]``/etc-/pki/trust/anchors`` on the {productname} Server..
Re-trust the certificate by running the [command]``update-ca-certificates`` command on the command line, and restart the spacewalk services.
====

After your VHM has been created and configured, Taskomatic will run data collection automatically.
If you want to manually perform data collection, navigate to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers], select the appropriate VHM, and click btn:[Refresh Data].

{productname} ships with a tool called [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` that can connect to VHMs using their API, and request information about virtual hosts.
[command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` maintains the concept of optional modules, where each module enables a specific VHM.
This tool is automatically invoked nightly by Taskomatic.
Log files for the [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` tool are located at [path]``/var/log/rhn/gatherer.log``.
