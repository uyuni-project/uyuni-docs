You can automate client installation with a number of different autoinstallation methods.
This is useful if you need to install a large number of clients.

For most clients, you can use an autoinstallation file.
The autoinstallation file contains information about the distribution to install on the clients.
There are two main types of autoinstallation file:

* For {sle} clients, use {ay}.
* For {rhel} clients, use {kickstart}.

When you have created an autoinstallation file, you can upload and manage it in the {productname} {webui}.
The {webui} also provides tools to help you edit and maintain your autoinstallation files.
For more information about autoinstallation files, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-setup.adoc[].

When you have created your autoinstallation files, you can create a profile to manage them.
This makes it easier to store and manage multiple autoinstallation files for different types of clients.
For more information about autoinstallation profiles, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-profiles.adoc[].

When you are ready to perform the autoinstallation, you need to make the {productname} Server aware of the client.
This is called provisioning.
You can provision a client by enabling bare metal provisioning.
Using this method, when a client connects to an IP address within a given range, the autoinstallation begins.
You can also use Cobbler and PXE booting to provision clients within your network.
Alternatively, you can provision clients using the {productname} API.
For more information about client provisioning, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-provisioning.adoc[].
