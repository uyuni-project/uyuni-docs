= Contact Methods for Salt Clients

Salt clients can communicate with the {productname} Server using SSH.

Push via Salt SSH is used in environments where clients cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the {productname} Server.
