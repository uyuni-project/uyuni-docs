== Add Software Channels

Before you register {alibabaclo} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[alibaba-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Alibaba Cloud Linux Products - WebUI
|===
| OS Version | Product Name
| {alibabaclo} 2 | Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 x86_64
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[alibaba-channels-suma-cli]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Alibaba Cloud Linux Channels - CLI
|===
| OS Version | Base Channel
| {alibabaclo} 2 | alibaba-2-x86_64
|===

== Create an Activation Key

You need to create an activation key that is associated with your {alibabaclo} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



== Register Clients

{alibabaclo} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.

Some {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 instances will fail to register on the first try.

This is due to a to a known bug in the {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 image.

The `python-urlgrabber3` package is provided both as a Python pip package and 
an RPM package, which can cause a conflict on the first attempt to register. 

If your instance is based on one of the affected image versions, the client 
should register correctly on the second registration attempt.

For more information about client registration, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
