== Create an Activation Key

You need to create an activation key that is associated with your {alibabaclo} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



== Register Clients

Some {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 instances will fail to register on the first try.
This is due to a to a known bug in the {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 image.

The `python-urlgrabber3` package is provided both as a Python pip package and an RPM package, which can cause a conflict on the first attempt to register.

If your instance is based on one of the affected image versions, the client should register correctly on the second registration attempt.
