= Registering {rocky} Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {rocky} operating systems.

[NOTE]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {rocky}{nbsp}8.
{rocky}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====

[NOTE]
====
Registering {rocky} clients to {productname} is tested with the default SELinux configuration of ``enforcing`` with a ``targeted`` policy.
You do not need to disable SELinux to register {rocky} clients to {productname}.
====

== Add Software Channels

Before you can register {rocky} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[rocky-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.CentOS Products - WebUI
|===
| OS Version | Product Name
| {rocky} 8 | {rocky} 8 x86_64
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[rocky-channels-suma-cli]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.CentOS Channels - CLI
|===
| OS Version | Base Channel
| {rocky} 8 | rocky8-x86_64
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_cli.adoc[]

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[rocky-channels-uyuni-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.CentOS Channels - CLI
|===
| OS Version | Base Channel | Client Channel       | AppStream Channel
| {rocky} 8 | rocky8      | rocky8-uyuni-client | rocky8-appstream
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_novendor_cli_multiarch.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====

endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
For {rocky} 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels.
You require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
You might notice some disparity in the number of packages available in the AppStream channel between upstream and the {productname} channel.
You might also see different numbers if you compare the same channel added at a different point in time.
This is due to the way that {rocky} manages their repositories.
{rocky} removes older version of packages when a new version is released, while {productname} keeps all of them, regardless of age.

== Create an Activation Key

You need to create an activation key that is associated with your {rocky} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients
