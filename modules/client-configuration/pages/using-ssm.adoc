= Using the System Set Manager






System Set Manager is used to administrate groups of systems, rather than performing actions on one system at a time.
It works for both Salt and Traditional systems.

For a complete list of the tasks that you can perform with the System Set Manager, see xref:reference:systems/ssm-menu.adoc[].



== Setting up System Set Manager

You need to select which systems you want to work with before you can use System Set Manager to perform operations.

Navigate to menu:Main Menu[Systems > System List > All] and check the boxes to the left of the systems you want to work with.
This will automatically add your chosen systems to System Set Manager.

You can access System Set Manager in three different ways:

* Navigating to menu:Systems[System Set Manager].
* Navigating to menu:Systems[System Groups] and clicking btn:[Use in SSM] for the system group you want to work with.
* Navigating to menu:Systems[System Groups], selecting the group you want to work with, and clicking btn:[Work with Group].



== Using System Set Manager

The details you see in System Set Manager might differ slightly from the details available in other parts of the {productname} {webui}.
If you are looking at the details of a single system in the {webui}, then you will only be able to see the latest available versions of package updates.
When you look at the same system in System Set Manager, all available versions will be shown.
This is intended to make it easier for system administrators to manage package versions, and choose to upgrade to packages that might not be the latest version.
