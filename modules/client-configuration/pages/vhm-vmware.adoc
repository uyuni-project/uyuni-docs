= Virtualization with VMWare

You can use VMWare vSphere virtual machines, including ESXi and vCenter, with {productname} by setting up a virtual host manager (VHM).

To begin, you will need to set up a VHM on your {productname} Server, and inventory the available VM hosts.
Taskomatic can then begin data collection using the VMs API.



== VHM Setup


The Virtual Host Manager (VHM) runs on the {productname} Server.

To run a VHM, your {productname} Server will need to have port 443 open, to access the VMWare API.

VMWare hosts use access roles and permissions to control access to hosts and guests.
Ensure that any VMWare objects or resources that you want to be inventoried by the VHM have at least [parameter]``read-only`` permissions.
If you want to exclude any objects or resources, mark them with [parameter]``no-access``.

When you are adding new hosts to {productname}, you will need to consider if the roles and permissions that have been assigned to users and objects need to be inventoried by {productname}.

For more on users, roles, and permissions, see the VMWare vSphere documentation: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html


.Procedure: Creating a VMWare VHM

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers].
. Click btn:[Create] and select [guimenu]``VMWare-based``.
. In the [guimenu]``Add a VMWare-based Virtual Host Manager`` section, use these parameters:
* In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, type a custom name for your VHM.
* In the [guimenu]``Hostname`` field, type the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or host IP address.
* In the [guimenu]``Port`` field, type the ESXi API port to use (for example, [parameter]``443``).
* In the [guimenu]``Username`` field, type the username associated with the VM host.
* In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, type the password associated with the VM host user.
. Click btn:[Create] to save your changes and create the VHM.
. On the [guimenu]``Virtual Host Managers`` page select the new VHM.
. On the [guimenu]``Properties`` page, click btn:[Refresh Data] to inventory the new VHM.

To see which objects and resources have been inventoried, navigate to menu:Systems[System List > Virtual Systems].


[NOTE]
====
Connecting to the ESXi server from a browser using HTTPS can sometimes log an ``invalid certificate`` error.
If this occurs, refreshing the data from the virtual hosts server will fail.
To correct the problem, extract the certificate from the ESXi server, and copy it to [path]``/etc/pki/trust/anchors``.
Re-trust the certificate by running the [command]``update-ca-certificates`` command on the command line, and restart the spacewalk services.
====

After your VHM has been created and configured, Taskomatic will run data collection automatically.
If you want to manually perform data collection, navigate to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers], select the appropriate VHM, and click btn:[Refresh Data].

{productname} ships with a tool called [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` that can connect to VHMs using their API, and request information about virtual hosts.
[command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` maintains the concept of optional modules, where each module enables a specific VHM.
This tool is automatically invoked nightly by Taskomatic.
Log files for the [command]``virtual-host-gatherer`` tool are located at [path]``/var/log/rhn/gather.log``.



== Troubleshooting SSL Errors on VMWare

If you see SSL errors while configuring your VMWare installation, you need to download the CA certificate file from VMWare, and trust it on {productname}.



.Procedure: Trusting VMWare CA Certificates
. Download the CA Certificate from your VMWare installation.
    You can do this by logging in to your vCenter {webui}, and clicking btn:[Download trusted root CA certificates].
. If the downloaded CA certificates file is in ``.zip`` format, extract the archive.
    The certificate files will have a number as an extension.
    For example,  ``certificate.0``.
. Copy the certificate files to your {productname} Server, and save them to the [path]``/etc/pki/trust/anchors/`` directory.
. Change the filename suffix on the copied certificate to either ``.crt`` or ``.pem``.
. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, update the CA certificate record:
