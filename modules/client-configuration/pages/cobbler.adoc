[[cobbler]]
= Cobbler

Cobbler is an installation server that allows you to perform unattended system installations.
Cobbler is installed on the {productname} Server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} only supports Cobbler functions that are available in the {productname} {webui}, or through the {productname} API.
Only supported features are documented here.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you intend to use your installation with {smr} formulas, do not follow this guide to configure Cobbler on the branch server.
In {smr} installations, the TFTPD formula manages these settings.
For more information about the TFTPD formula, see xref:salt:formula-tftpd.adoc[].
====

This section explains the Cobbler features most commonly used with {productname}:

* The [command]``cobbler sync`` command is triggered from {productname} Server and generate the TFTP boot environment
* Installation environment analysis using the [command]``cobbler check`` command
* Virtual machine guest installation automation with the [command]``koan`` client-side tool
* Building installation ISOs with PXE-like menus using the [command]``cobbler buildiso`` command (for {productname} systems with x86_64 architecture)

For more information about Cobbler, see https://cobbler.readthedocs.io.





== Cobbler Requirements

To use Cobbler for system installation with PXE, you will require a TFTP server.
{productname} installs a TFTP server by default.
To PXE boot systems, you will require a DHCP server, or have access to a network DHCP server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Cobbler uses host names as a unique key for each system.
If you are using the [option]``pxe-default-image`` to onboard bare metal systems, make sure every system has a unique host name.
Non-unique host names will cause all systems with the same host name to have the configuration files overwritten when a provisioning profile is assigned.
====



[[cobbler-configure]]
== Configure Cobbler

Cobbler configuration is primarily managed using the [path]``/etc/cobbler/settings`` file.
Cobbler will run with the default settings unchanged.
All configurable settings are explained in detail in the [path]``/etc/cobbler/settings`` file.

// Removed tshooting language not found error, only applies to sles 12 & SUMA 2.1/3: https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7018334 LKB 2018-08-02


The PXE boot process uses DHCP to find the TFTP boot server.
The {productname} Server can act as such a  TFTP boot server and Cobbler can generate the content for it.
You must have administrative access to the network's DHCP server.
Edit the DHCP configuration file so that it points to the {productname} Server as the TFTP boot server:



.Procedure: Example for Configuring the ISC DHCP Server
. On the DHCP server, as root, open the [path]``/etc/dhcpd.conf`` file.
. Append a new class with options for performing PXE boot installation.
    For example:
+
----
allow booting;
allow bootp;
class "PXE"
{match if substring(option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 9) = "PXEClient";
next-server 192.168.2.1;
filename "pxelinux.0";}
----
+
This example:

* Enables the [systemitem]``bootp`` protocol for network booting.
* Creates a class called ``PXE``.
* Identifies systems as ``PXEClient`` if they are configured with PXE as the first boot priority.
* Directs PXEClients to the Cobbler server at ``192.168.2.1``.
* Retrieves the [path]``pxelinux.0``bootloader file.
+
. Save the file.


While it is possible to use KVM with PXE booting, it can be unreliable.
We do not recommend you use this on production systems.



.Procedure: Configuring PXE Boot in KVM
. Use the [command]``virsh`` command to produce a dump of the current network XML description:
+
----
virsh net-dumpxml --inactive network > network.xml
----

. Open the XML dump file at [path]``network.xml`` and add a [systemitem]``bootp`` parameter within the [systemitem]``<dhcp>``` element:
+
----
<bootp file='/pxelinux.0' server='192.168.100.153'/>
----

. Use the [command]``virsh`` command to install the updated description:
+
----
virsh net-define network.xml
----
+
Alternatively, you can use the [command]``net-edit`` subcommand, which will also perform some error checking.

.Example: Minimal Network XML Description for KVM
----
<network>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>1da84185-31b5-4c8b-9ee2-a7f5ba39a7ee</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
      <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:29:59:18'/>
  <domain name='default'/>
  <ip address='192.168.100.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.100.128' end='192.168.100.254'/>
      <bootp file='/pxelinux.0' server='192.168.100.153'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
----



== TFTP

{productname} uses the [daemon]``tftp`` daemon.
The [daemon]``tftp`` daemon is the recommended method for PXE services, and is installed by default.
The default configuration works in most cases.
However, if you need to change the configuration, use the {yast} Services Manager.

The TFTP service must be running so it can serve the [path]``pxelinux.0`` boot image.
Start {yast} and use menu:System[Services Manager] to configure the [daemon]``tftp`` daemon.

You can also synchronize Cobbler-generated TFTP contents to a {productname} Proxy.
For synchronization, HTTPS port 443 must be open.



.Procedure: Installing TFTP

. On the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``susemanager-tftpsync`` package:
+
----
zypper install susemanager-tftpsync
----
. On the {productname} Proxy, as root user, install the [systemitem]``susemanager-tftpsync-recv`` package:
+
----
zypper install susemanager-tftpsync-recv
----



.Procedure: Configuring TFTP on a Proxy

. On the {productname} Proxy, as root, run the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` script.
. The script will interactively ask you for details on the host names and IP addresses of the {productname} Server and Proxy, as well for the location of the [path]``tftpboot`` directory on the Proxy.

For more information, use the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh --help`` command.


.Procedure: Configuring TFTP on a Server

. On the {productname} Server, as root, run the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` script.
+
----
configure-tftpsync.sh proxy1.example.com proxy2.example.com
----
. Run the [command]``cobbler sync`` command to push the files to the proxy.
    This will fail if you have not configured the proxies correctly.
. If you want to change the list of proxies later on, you can use the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` script to edit them.

[NOTE]
====
If you reinstall an already configured proxy and want to push all the files again, you must remove the cache file at [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json`` before you call [command]``cobbler sync``.
====



=== Background Information about the Synchronization Process

// Taken from https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1141603
// To be edited!!!

A [command]``cobbler sync`` is a rebuild of every file Cobbler touched.
On {productname}, [command]``cobbler sync`` does the following actions:

1. Run pre-sync triggers.
    This can be any number of shell scripts.
2. Delete all files and directories that are not allowed in [path]``/srv/www/cobbler/``.
3. Create all needed directories.
4. Delete all elements inside the directories.
5. Create the TFTPD directory.
6. Write the DHCP files if management is enabled (unsupported).
    For more information, see <<cobbler-configure>>.
7. Do the same with DNS (unsupported).
8. Clean up the cache.
9. Run [command]``rsync`` if rsync management is enabled.
10. Run post-sync triggers.
    This can be any number of shell scripts (unsupported).

{productname} also adds or removes, or edits systems that are in Cobbler.
Those actions trigger a so-called lite sync process.
This sync only touches files and directories that are related to the change which triggered it.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have created Cobbler profiles, distributions, or systems using the {productname} {webui}, you must manage them in the {webui}.
If you make changes at the command prompt, the profiles will not synchronize correctly, and the {webui} will show incorrect values.
====



== Synchronize and Start the Cobbler Service

When tftpsync is configured, the {productname} Server must be able to access the {productname} Proxy systems directly.



[WARNING]
====
Do not start or stop the [command]``cobblerd`` service independent of the {productname} service.
Doing so can cause errors.
Always use [command]``/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service`` to start or stop {productname}.
====

Check that all the prerequisites the Cobbler service requires, are configured according to your requirements.
You can do this by running the [command]``cobbler check`` command.

// Does this work and makes sense?
When you had to change the configuration, restart the {productname} service:

----
/usr/sbin/spacewalk-service restart
----



== Autoinstallation Templates

AutoYaST or Kickstart profiles are used to automate {sle} or {rhel} client installations.
Templates are used to describe how to create autoinstallation profiles.
You can create autoinstallation variables within the {productname} {webui}.
This allows you to create and manage large numbers of profiles and systems, without having to manually create profiles for each.

Cobbler uses a template engine called Cheetah that provides support for templates, variables, and snippets.

For more information on creating profiles, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-distributions.adoc[].


=== Kickstart Template Syntax

Kickstart templates can have static values for certain common items such as PXE image file names, subnet addresses, and common paths such as [path]``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/``.
However, templates differ from standard Kickstart files in their use of variables.

For example, a standard Kickstart file might have a networking section like this:

----
network --device=eth0 --bootproto=static --ip=192.168.100.24 \
  --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=192.168.100.1 --nameserver=192.168.100.2
----

In a Kickstart template file, the networking section would look like this instead:

----
network --device=$net_dev --bootproto=static --ip=$ip_addr \
  --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=$my_gateway --nameserver=$my_nameserver
----

These variables are substituted with the values set in your Kickstart profile variables or in your system detail variables.
If the same variable is defined in both the profile and the system detail, then the system detail variable takes precedence.


Kickstart templates use syntax rules that rely on punctuation symbols.
To avoid clashes, they need to be properly treated.

If the template contains shell script variables like ``$(example)``, the content needs to be escaped with a backslash: ``\$(example)``.
If the variable is defined in the template, the templating engine will evaluate it correctly.
If there is no such variable, the content will be left unchanged.
Escaping the kbd:[$] symbol will prevent the templating engine from evaluating the symbol as an internal variable.

Long scripts or strings can be escaped by wrapping them with the `\#raw` and `\#end raw` directives.
For example:

----
#raw
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..2}; do
 echo "$i - Hello World!"
done
#end raw
----

Any line with a kbd:[#] symbol followed by a whitespace is treated as a comment and is therefore not evaluated.
For example:

----
#start some section (this is a comment)
echo "Hello, world"
#end some section (this is a comment)
----



=== Kickstart Snippets

Kickstart snippets are sections of Kickstart code that can be called by a [option]``$SNIPPET()`` function.
The snippet is parsed by Cobbler and substituted with the contents of the snippet.

This example sets up a snippet for a common hard drive partition configuration:

----
clearpart --all
part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary
part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary
part swap --recommended

part pv.00 --size=1 --grow

volgroup vg00 pv.00
logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000
----

Save this snippet of the configuration to a file in [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/snippets/``, where Cobbler can access it.

Use the snippet by calling the [option]``$SNIPPET()`` function in your Kickstart templates.
For example:

----
$SNIPPET('my_partition')
----

Cobbler will parse the function with the snippet of code contained in the [path]``my_partition`` file.




== Build ISOs with Cobbler

Cobbler can create ISO boot images that contain a set of distributions, kernels, and a menu, that work similar to a PXE installation.

[NOTE]
====
Building ISOs with Cobbler is not supported on {ibmz}.
====

The Cobbler [command]``buildiso`` command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO.
For example:

----
cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso
----

The boot ISO includes all profiles and systems by default.
You can limit which profiles and systems are used, with the [option]``--profiles`` and [option]``--systems`` options.
For example:

----
cobbler buildiso --systems="system1 system2 system3" \
  --profiles="profile1 profile2 profile3"
----

[NOTE]
====
If you cannot write an ISO image to a public [path]``tmp`` directory, check your systemd settings in [path]``/usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.service``.
====




== Bare Metal Provisioning

Systems that have not yet been provisioned are called bare metal systems.
You can provision bare metal systems using Cobbler.
Once a bare metal system has been provisioned in this way, it will appear in the [guilabel]``Systems`` list, where you can perform regular provisioning with autoinstallation, for a completely unattended installation.

To successfully provision a bare metal system, you will require a fully patched {productname} server.

The system to be provisioned must have x86_64 architecture, with at least 2&#160;GB RAM, and be capable of PXE booting.

The server uses TFTP to provision the bare metal client, so the appropriate port and networks must be configured correctly in order for provisioning to be successful.
In particular, ensure that you have a DHCP server, and have set the [option]``next-server`` parameter to the {productname} server IP address or hostname.


=== Enable Bare Metal Systems Management

Bare metal systems management can be enabled or disabled in the {productname} {webui} by navigating to menu:Admin[SUSE Manager Configuration > Bare-metal systems].

[NOTE]
====
New systems are added to the organization of the administrator who enabled the bare metal systems management feature.
To change the organization, log in as an Administrator of the required organization, and re-enable the feature.
====

When the feature has been enabled, any bare metal system connected to the server network will be automatically added to the organization when it is powered on.
The process can take a few minutes, and the system will automatically shut down when it is complete.
The system will now be visible in the menu:Systems[System list].
Click on the name of the system to see basic information.
For more details, go to the [guilabel]``Properties``, [guilabel]``Notes``, and [guilabel]``Hardware`` tabs.
You can migrate bare metal systems to other organizations if required, using the [guilabel]``Migrate`` tab.



=== Provision Bare Metal Systems

Provisioning bare metal systems is similar to provisioning other systems, and can be done using the [guilabel]``Provisioning`` tab.
However, you will not be able to schedule provisioning, it will happen automatically as soon as the system is configured and powered on.

[NOTE]
====
System Set Manager can be used with bare metal systems.
However, not all SSM features are available, because bare metal systems do not have an operating system installed.
This also applies to mixed sets that contain bare metal systems.
All features will be re-enabled if the bare metal systems are removed from the set.
