[[autoinst-owngpgkey]]
= Use Your Own GPG Key

If the repositories you are using for autoinstallation have unsigned metadata, you usually have to use the [option]``insecure=1`` kernel parameter as an option of the autoinstallable distribution, and use a [path]``spacewalk/sles_no_signature_checks`` code snippet in the {ay} installation file.

A safer alternative is to provide your own GPG key.

[NOTE]
====
This technique applies to {suse} clients only.
====

.Procedure: Include Your Own GPG Key
. Create a GPG key.
. Use it to sign the package's metadata.
. Add it to the initial RAM disk of your installation media.

* For information on how to create the key and sign the metadata with it, see xref:administration:repo-metadata.adoc[Signing Repository Metadata].
* For information on how to add the key to installation media used for network boot, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-owngpgkey.adoc#gpg-key-pxeboot[Own GPG Key for PXE Boot].
* For information on how to add the key to installation media used for a boot from CD-ROM, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-owngpgkey.adoc#gpg-key-cdrom[Own GPG Key in a CD-ROM].

[NOTE]
====
When you signed the metadata with your new GPG key, any already onboarded client will not know about the new key.
Ideally, you should sign the metadata before you register any client.

For already onboarded clients that use those repositories, the workaround is to disable GPG key checking on them.

[[gpg-key-pxeboot]]
== Own GPG Key for PXE Boot

The initial RAM disk ([path]``initrd``) used by PXE boot process normally contains {suse}'s GPG key only.
You must add our own key to this file, so it can be used to check the packages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To access a shell inside the Server container run [literal]``mgrctl term`` on the container host.
====

.Procedure: Add a GPG key to the initial RAM disk
. Create a directory with a path identical to the one that is used during the boot process to find the GPG key:
+
----
mkdir -p tftproot/usr/lib/rpm/gnupg/keys
----
. Copy your GPG key into this directory with the suffix [path]``.asc``:
+
----
cp /srv/www/htdocs/pub/mgr-gpg-pub.key tftproot/usr/lib/rpm/gnupg/keys/mgr-gpg-pub.asc
----
. Inside the top level directory, package the content and append it to the [path]``initrd`` that is part of your installation media files:
+
----
cd tftproot
find . | cpio -o -H newc | xz --check=crc32 -c >> /path/to/initrd
----



[[gpg-key-cdrom]]
== Own GPG Key in a CD-ROM

You can modify an installation image with the [command]``mksusecd`` utility.
This utility is contained in the Development Tools module.

.Procedure: Add a GPG key to an Installation ISO image
. Create a directory with a path identical to the one that is used during the boot process to find the GPG key:
+
----
mkdir -p initrdroot/usr/lib/rpm/gnupg/keys
----
. Copy your GPG key into this directory with the suffix [path]``.asc``:
+
----
cp /srv/www/htdocs/pub/mgr-gpg-pub.key initrdroot/usr/lib/rpm/gnupg/keys/mgr-gpg-pub.asc
----
. Amend the existing ISO image with [command]``mksusecd``:
+
----
mksusecd --create <new-image>.iso --initrd initrdroot/ <old-image>.iso
----
