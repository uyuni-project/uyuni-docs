= System Locking

include::{localesdir}[]


System locks are used to prevent actions from occurring on a client.
For example, a system lock prevents a client from being updated or restarted.
This is useful for clients running production software, or to prevent accidental changes.
You can disable the system lock when you are ready to perform actions.

System locks are implemented differently on traditional and Salt clients.



== System Locks on Traditional Clients

When a traditional client is locked, no actions can be scheduled using the {webui}, and a padlock icon is displayed next to the name of the client in the menu:System[System List].



.Procedure: System Locking a Traditional Client
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to the [guimenu]``System Details`` page for the client you want to lock.
. Under [guimenu]``Lock Status``, click btn:[Lock this system].
    The client remains locked until you click btn:[Unlock this system].

//Something about requiring admin rights here maybe? --LKB 20200514

Some actions can still be completed on locked traditional clients, including remote commands, and automated patch updates.
To stop automated patch updates, navigate to the [guimenu]``System Details`` page for the client, and on the [guimenu]``Properties`` tab, uncheck [guimenu]``Auto Patch Update``.



== System Locks on Salt Clients

When a Salt client is locked, or put into blackout mode, no actions can be scheduled, Salt execution commands are disabled, and a yellow banner is displayed on the [guimenu]``System Details`` page.
In this mode, actions can be scheduled for the locked client using the {webui} or the API, but the actions fail.


[NOTE]
====
The locking mechanism is not available for Salt SSH clients.
====



.Procedure: System Locking a Salt Client
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to the [guimenu]``System Details`` page for the client you want to lock.
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab, check the system lock formula, and click btn:[Save].
. Navigate to the menu:Formulas[System Lock] tab, check [guimenu]``Lock system``, and click btn:[Save].
    On this page, you can also enable specific Salt modules while the client is locked.
. When you have made your changes, you might need to apply the highstate.
    In this case, a banner in the {webui} notifies you.
    The client remains locked until you remove the system lock formula.


[NOTE]
====
The system lock formula is enabled by default if {caasp} is detected on the node.

== Package Locks

[NOTE]
====
Package locks can only be used on traditional clients that use the Zypper package manager.
The feature is not currently supported on {rhel} or Salt clients.
====

Package locks are used to prevent unauthorized installation or upgrades to software packages on traditional clients.
When a package has been locked, it shows a padlock icon, indicating that it cannot be installed.
Any attempt to install a locked package is reported as an error in the event log.

Locked packages cannot be installed, upgraded, or removed, either through the {productname} {webui}, or directly on the client machine using a package manager.
Locked packages also indirectly lock any dependent packages.


.Procedure: Using Package Locks
. On the client machine, install the [package]``zypp-plugin-spacewalk`` package as [systemitem]``root``:
+
----
zypper in zypp-plugin-spacewalk
----

. Navigate to the menu:Software[Packages > Lock] tab on the managed system to see a list of all available packages.
. Select the packages to lock, and click btn:[Request Lock].
    You can also choose to enter a date and time for the lock to activate.
    Leave the date and time blank if you want the lock to activate as soon as possible.
    Note that the lock might not activate immediately.
. To remove a package lock, select the packages to unlock and click btn:[Request Unlock].
    Leave the date and time blank if you want the lock to deactivate as soon as possible.
    The lock might not deactivate immediately.
