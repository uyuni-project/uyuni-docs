[[autoinst-reinstall]]
= Reinstall Registered Systems

The in-place reinstallation starts from the local client system.
There is therefore no need for the client to be able to boot over network with PXE.

To reinstall a registered client in-place, you must define an autoinstallable distribution and an autoinstallation profile.
For information, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-distributions.adoc[Autoinstallable Distributions] and xref:client-configuration:autoinst-profiles.adoc[Autoinstallation Profiles].

When you have defined the autoinstallation profile and distribution, you can perform the reinstallation.



.Procedure: Reinstall an Already Registered Client
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Systems List], select the client to reinstall, and go to the menu:Provisioning[Autoinstallation > Schedule] subtab.
. Select the autoinstallation profile that you prepared, select a proxy if needed, and click btn:[Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish].
. If your client is a traditional client, and you have not configured osad, you need to wait until the job is fetched.
. You can monitor progress of the installation by navigating to menu:Provisioning[Autoinstallation > Session Status], or on the client directly.
  The client reboots, and in the boot menu selects a new choice called [guimenu]``reinstall-system``.
