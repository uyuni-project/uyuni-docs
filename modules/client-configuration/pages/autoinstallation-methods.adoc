= Automate Client Installation


{ay} and Kickstart configuration files allow you to automate client system installations.
This is useful if you need to install a large number of clients.

For {sle} clients, use {ay}.
When you have created an {ay} file, you can upload and manage it using the {productname} {webui}.

For {rhel} clients, use Kickstart.
Kickstart files are created, modified, and managed within the {productname} {webui}.

We recommend that you use PXE boot for installing clients.
PXE booting requires a DHCP server that points to your {productname} Server.
The {productname} Server then acts as a TFTP server.
The TFTP environment is generated with Cobbler.
Cobbler can also generate a bootable ISO image.
The ISO image can be used to install machines when PXE boot is not an option.
For more information about Cobbler, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].

Just going to leave this here for now. It will need a lot more work once the systems/autoinst stuff comes over from the Reference Guide. --LKB 2020-08-04

[[sd-provisioning-autoinstallation]]
== Autoinstallation

The [guimenu]``Schedule`` subtab allows you to configure and schedule an autoinstallation for this system.
For background information about autoinstallation, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-overview.adoc[].


image::system_details_traditional_provisioning_schedule_wizard.png[scaledwidth=80%]

In the [guimenu]``Schedule`` subtab, schedule the selected system for autoinstallation.
Choose from the list of available profiles.

[NOTE]
====
You must create a profile before it appears on this subtab.
For more information about profiles, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-profiles.adoc[].
====

To alter autoinstallation settings, click the btn:[Advanced Configuration] button.
Configure the network connection and post-installation networking information.
You can aggregate multiple network interfaces into a single logical "bonded" interface.
In [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` specify kernel options to be used during autoinstallation. [guimenu]``Post Kernel Options`` are used after the installation is complete and the system is booting for the first time.
Configure package profile synchronization.

Select a time for the autoinstallation to begin and click btn:[Schedule Autoinstall and Finish] for all changes to take effect and to schedule the autoinstallation.

Alternatively, click [guimenu]``Create PXE Installation Configuration`` to create a Cobbler system record.
The selected autoinstallation profile will be used to automatically install the configured distribution next time that particular system boots from PXE.
In this case {productname} and its network must be properly configured to allow boot using PXE.

[NOTE]
====
Any settings changed on the [guimenu]``Advanced Configuration`` page will be ignored when creating a PXE installation configuration for Cobbler.
====


The [guimenu]``Variables`` subtab can be used to create Kickstart variables, which substitute values in Kickstart files.
To define a variable, create a name-value pair ([replaceable]``name/value``) in the text box.

For example, to {kickstart} a system that joins the network of a specific organization (for example the Engineering department) you can create a profile variable to set the IP address and the gateway server address to a variable that any system using that profile will use.
Add the following line to the [guimenu]``Variables`` text box:

----
IPADDR=192.168.0.28
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
----

To use the system variable, use the name of the variable in the profile instead of the value.
For example, the [option]``network`` portion of a {kickstart} file could look like the following:

----
network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$IPADDR \
  --gateway=$GATEWAY
----

The [option]``$IPADDR`` will be ``192.168.0.28``, and the [option]``$GATEWAY`` will be ``192.168.0.1``.

[NOTE]
====
There is a hierarchy when creating and using variables in {kickstart} files.
System {kickstart} variables take precedence over profile variables, which in turn take precedence over distribution variables.
Understanding this hierarchy can alleviate confusion when using variables in {kickstart}.
====

Using variables are one part of the larger Cobbler infrastructure for creating templates that can be shared between multiple profiles and systems.
For more information about Cobbler and {kickstart} templates, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].

.Autoinstallation Types: {ay} and Kickstart
[NOTE]
====
In the following section, {ay} and {ay} features apply for {sle} client systems only.
For {rhela} systems, use Kickstart and Kickstart features.
====


.Auto-Installing Salt Clients Currently Not Supported
[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure will work for traditionally  managed systems (system type [systemitem]``management``).
It is not currently available for systems using Salt (system type [systemitem]``salt``).
====

{ay} and Kickstart configuration files allow administrators to create an environment for automating otherwise time-consuming system installations, such as multiple servers or workstations.
{ay} files have to be uploaded to be managed with {productname}.
Kickstart files can be created, modified, and managed within the {productname} Web interface.

{productname} also features the Cobbler installation server.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].


{productname} provides an interface for developing Kickstart and {ay} profiles that can be used to install {rhel} or {sle} on either new or already-registered systems automatically according to certain specifications.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have created Cobbler profiles, distributions, or systems using the {productname} {webui}, you must manage them in the {webui}.
If you make changes at the command prompt, the profiles will not synchronize correctly, and the {webui} will show incorrect values.

.Autoinstallation Overview
image::systems_kickstart_overview.png[scaledwidth=444]


This overview page displays the status of automated installations (Kickstart and {ay}) on your client systems: the types and number of profiles you have created and the progress of systems that are scheduled to be installed using Kickstart or {ay}.

In the upper right area is the menu:Autoinstallation Actions[] section, which contains a series of links to management actions for your Kickstart or {ay}  profiles.

* For more on {ay}, see xref:client-configuration:client-automating-installation.adoc[].
* For more on Kickstart, see xref:client-configuration:kickstart.adoc[].
