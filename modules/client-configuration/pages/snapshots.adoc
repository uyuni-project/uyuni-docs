= Configuration Snapshots

Snapshots record the package profile, configuration files, and {productname} settings for a client at a set point in time.
You can roll back to older snapshots to restore previous configuration settings.

[NOTE]
====
Snapshots are supported on traditional clients only.
Salt clients do not support this feature.
====

Snapshots are captured automatically after some actions occur.
You can also manually take a snapshot at any time.
We recommend that you ensure you have a current snapshot before performing any potentially destructive action on your clients.

Snapshots are enabled by default.
You can disable automatic snapshots by setting [parameter]``enable_snapshots=0`` in the [path]``rhn.conf`` configuration file.

Manage your snapshots by navigating to menu:Systems[Systems List] and selecting the client you want to manage.
Navigate to the menu:Provisioning[Snapshots] tab to see a list of all current snapshots for the selected client.
Click the name of a snapshot to see more information about the changes recorded in the snapshot.
You can use the subtabs in the menu:Provisioning[Snapshots] tab to see the changes that rolling back to the selected snapshot will make to:

* Group memberships
* Channel subscriptions
* Installed packages
* Configuration channel subscriptions
* Configuration files
* Snapshot tags


[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use a snapshot to roll back most changes to a client, but not all of them.
For example, you cannot roll back multiple updates, and you cannot roll back a service pack migration.
Always ensure you have taken a backup before performing upgrades on your clients.
====



== Snapshot Tags

Snapshot tags allow you to add meaningful descriptions to your snapshots.
You can use tags to record extra information about snapshots, such as a last known working configuration, or a successful upgrade.

Manage your snapshot tags by navigating to menu:Systems[Systems List] and selecting the client you want to manage.
Navigate to the menu:Provisioning[Snapshot Tags] tab to see a list of all current snapshot tags for the selected client.
Click [guimenu]``Create System Tag``, enter a description, and click the btn:[Tag Current Snapshot] button.



== Snapshots on Large Installations

There is no maximum number of snapshots that {productname} will keep.
This means that the database that stores the snapshots grows as you add more clients, packages, channels, and configuration changes.

If you have a large installation, with thousands of clients, you can use the {productname} API to create a recurring cleanup script on a recurring schedule to ensure that old snapshots are deleted regularly.
Alternatively, you can disable the feature by setting [parameter]``enable_snapshots=0`` in the [path]``rhn.conf`` configuration file.
