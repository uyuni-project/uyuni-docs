This section contains information about registering clients running {openeuler} operating systems.

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]

// Use list format: repository URLs / packages and metadata / version info
[IMPORTANT]
====
* {openeuler} repository URLs are available from {scclongform}.
* Packages and metadata are provided by the OpenAtom Foundation, not by {suse}.
* For supported products, see the support table and the release notes.

[WARNING]
====
When created at AWS, {openeuler} instances always have the same `machine-id` id at `/etc/machine-id`.
Make sure you regenerate the `machine-id` after the instance is created.
For more information, see xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].

== Add Software Channels


Before you register {openeuler} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The architectures currently supported are: `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
//For full list of supported products and architectures, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].
