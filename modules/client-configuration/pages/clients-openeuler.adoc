[WARNING]
====
When created at AWS, {openeuler} instances always have the same `machine-id` id at `/etc/machine-id`.
Make sure you regenerate the `machine-id` after the instance is created.
For more information, see xref:administration:tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].

== Add Software Channels

Before you register {openeuler} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The architectures currently supported are: `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
For full list of supported products and architectures, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].
