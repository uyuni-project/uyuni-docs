This section contains information about registering clients running {opensuse} operating systems.
{productname} supports {opensuse} Tumbleweed clients using {salt}.

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {opensuse} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.



== Add Software Channels


Before you register {opensuse} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The architectures currently supported are: `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
For full list of supported products and architectures, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].

ifdef::backend-pdf[]
include::../partials/arch-other-note.adoc[]
endif::[]

For example, when working with `x86_64` architecture, you need this product:

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

[[opensuse-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.{opensuse} Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version
| Product Name

| {opensuse} Tumbleweed
| {opensuse} Tumbleweed x86_64

|===

include::client-configuration:partial$addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]
endif::[]

ifdef::backend-pdf[]

endif::[]

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

.{opensuse} Channels - CLI

| OS Version | Base Channel
| {opensuse}  | opensuse-tumbleweed-pool

| Client Channel           | opensuse_tumbleweed-uyuni-client

[IMPORTANT]
====
{opensuse} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====


== Manage GPG Keys

Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed.
Only trusted software can be installed on clients.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients.
It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted.
Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key.
====

For more information about GPG keys, see xref:client-configuration:gpg-keys.adoc[].
