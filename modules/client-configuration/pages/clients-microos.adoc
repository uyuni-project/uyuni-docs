= Registering {opensuse}{nbsp}{microos} Clients

This section contains information about registering clients running these {opensuse}{nbsp}{microos} operating systems:

* {opensuse}{nbsp}{microos}

[WARNING]
====
Support for {opensuse}{nbsp}{microos} clients is provided as a technology preview for testing purposes, and not all features are fully functional at this stage.
This feature is expected to be fully supported in a later version of {productname}.
Do not use this feature on production systems.
====



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {opensuse}{nbsp}{microos} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

include::snippets/arch-other-note.adoc[]

The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[opensuse-microos-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.openSUSE MicroOS Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Updates Channel

| {opensuse}{nbsp}{microos}
| opensuse_tumbleweed
| opensuse_tumbleweed-non-oss
| opensuse_tumbleweed-update

|===

include::snippets/addchannels_novendor_cli.adoc[]



== Check Synchronization Status

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_suma.adoc[]

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_uyuni.adoc[]

endif::[]

include::snippets/check_sync_cli.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
{opensuse}{nbsp}{microos} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====



== Trust Certificates Keys on Clients

{opensuse}{nbsp}{microos} is not yet fully enabled, so there are some manual steps to trust the {productname} SSL certificate on {microos} clients.

// Not tested. From https://etherpad.nue.suse.com/p/uyuni-microos. --LKB 2021-04-15


.Procedure: Installing and Configuring Salt
. On the client, at the command prompt, as root, retrieve the SSL certificate file from the server:
+
----
curl -k https://uyuni-server.hispa-net.com/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT -o /etc/pki/trust/anchors/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT
----
. Update the certificates on the client:
+
----
update-ca-certificates
----
. Install the required packages:
+
----
transactional-update pkg install salt-minion dmidecode
----
. Reboot the client.
  If a message is shown indicating that there is a conflict with ``busybox-hostname``, click btn:[Deinstallation of busybox-hostname].
. Create a new file called [path]``/etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager-transactional.conf`` with this content:
+
----
module_executors:
- transactional_update
- direct_call
----

Your {productname} Server will not show the true state of the client in the {webui} until after you have rebooted the client.
This feature is expected to be fully supported in a later version of {productname}.


[NOTE]
====
If Salt is failing to install any software, you could be using an old version of Salt.
Upgrade your Salt packages to the latest version to resolve this problem.
====



== Register Clients

////
To register your {opensuse}{nbsp}{microos} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

////

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
