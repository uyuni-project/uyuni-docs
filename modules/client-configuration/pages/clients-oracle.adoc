= Registering {oracle} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {oracle} operating systems.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
{oracle} repository URLs are available from {scc}, but the packages and metadata are provided by Oracle, not by {suse}.
{oracle} base media repositories are freely available for download from https://yum.oracle.com/.
====
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {oracle}{nbsp}8.
{oracle}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.

== Channel and Repository Management

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels
. On the {productname} Server, add the appropriate {oracle} channels:
+
* For {oracle} 6:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``Oracle Linux 6 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``oraclelinux6-x86_64``.
+
* For {oracle} 7:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``Oracle Linux 7 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``oraclelinux7-x86_64``.
+
* For {oracle} 8:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``Oracle Linux 8 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``oraclelinux8-x86_64``.
. Synchronize the {productname} Server with the {SCC}.
You can do this using the {webui}, or by running [command]``mgr-sync`` at the command prompt.
. Add the new channel to your activation key.
endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
For {oracle} 8 clients, add both the ``BaseOS`` and ``Appstream`` channels.
You will require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====


.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, add the {oracle} base, updates, and client channels, specifying the {oracle} version and architecture:
+
* For {oracle} 6:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 oraclelinux6 \
oraclelinux6-uyuni-client
----
+
* For {oracle} 7:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 oraclelinux7 \
oraclelinux7-uyuni-client
----
+
* For {oracle} 8:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 oraclelinux8 \
oraclelinux8-appstream oraclelinux8-uyuni-client
----


[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====

 .Procedure: Synchronizing Oracle repositories
 . In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage, and check every Oracle channel.
 . In the Repositories tab, navigate to the Sync subtab, and click Sync Now. You can also create a regular synchronization schedule on this page.

endif::[]


To check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``Products`` tab.
+
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
endif::[]

* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt with [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log`` file.
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.



== Create an Activation Key

You will need to create an activation key that is associated with your {oracle} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].



ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

By default, {oracle} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {oracle} client tools.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.

However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

To fix this, add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all {oracle} bootstrap scripts:
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----

 You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are bootstrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key.
Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.

endif::[]



== Register Clients

{oracle} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
