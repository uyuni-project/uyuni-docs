= Registering {oracle} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {oracle} operating systems.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
{oracle} repository URLs are available from {scc}, but the packages and metadata are provided by Oracle, not by {suse}.
{oracle} base media repositories are freely available for download from https://yum.oracle.com/.
====
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {oracle}{nbsp}8.
{oracle}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====


== Add Software Channels

Before you register {oracle} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {oracle} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[oracle-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
.Oracle Products - WebUI
|===
| OS Version | Product Name          | Updates Channel
| {oracle} 6 | Oracle Linux 6 x86_64 | -
| {oracle} 7 | Oracle Linux 7 x86_64 | -
| {oracle} 8 | Oracle Linux 8 x86_64 | oraclelinux8-appstream for x86_64
|===

include::snippets/add_channels_wizard.adoc[]

endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[oracle-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.Oracle Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Updates Channel

| {oracle} 6
| oraclelinux6
| oraclelinux6-uyuni-client
| -

| {oracle} 7
| oraclelinux7
| oraclelinux7-uyuni-client
| -

| {oracle} 8
| oraclelinux8
| oraclelinux8-uyuni-client
| oraclelinux8-appstream

|===

include::snippets/add_channels_cli.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====

endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {oracle} 8 clients, add both the Base and Appstream channels.
You will require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.

== Check Synchronization Status

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

== Create an Activation Key

You will need to create an activation key that is associated with your {oracle} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].




== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

include::snippets/trust_gpg.adoc[]




== Register Clients

{oracle} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].


[WARNING]
====
To register and use {oracle}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.
For more information about how to resolve this error, see ``Registering Older Clients`` at xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
