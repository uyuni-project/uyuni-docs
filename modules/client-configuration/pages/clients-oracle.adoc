= Registering {oracle} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {oracle} operating systems.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
{oracle} repository URLs are available from {scc}, but the packages and metadata are provided by Oracle, not by {suse}.
{oracle} base media repositories are freely available for download from https://yum.oracle.com/.
====
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {oracle}{nbsp}8.
{oracle}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====


== Add Software Channels

Before you register {oracle} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The architectures currently supported are: `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
For full list of supported products and architectures, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].

include::snippets/arch-other-note.adoc[]

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

//The products you need for this procedure are:
For example, when working with `x86_64` architecture, you need this products:

[[oracle-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Oracle Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version | Product Name
| {oracle} 6 | Oracle Linux 6 x86_64
| {oracle} 7 | Oracle Linux 7 x86_64
| {oracle} 8 | Oracle Linux 8 x86_64
|===

[NOTE]
====
{oracle} 6 is now at end-of-life, and the ISO images provided in the repository are out of date.
Bootstrapping new {oracle} 6 clients using these packages will fail.
If you need to bootstrap new {oracle} 6 clients, follow the troubleshooting procedure in xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
====

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[oracle-channels-suma-cli]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Oracle Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version | Base Channel
| {oracle} 6 | oraclelinux6-x86_64
| {oracle} 7 | oraclelinux7-x86_64
| {oracle} 8 | oraclelinux8-x86_64
|===

[NOTE]
====
{oracle} 6 is now at end-of-life, and the ISO images provided in the repository are out of date.
Bootstrapping new {oracle} 6 clients using these packages will fail.
If you need to bootstrap new {oracle} 6 clients, follow the troubleshooting procedure in xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[oracle-channels-uyuni-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.Oracle Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Updates Channel

| {oracle} 6
| oraclelinux6
| oraclelinux6-uyuni-client
| -

| {oracle} 7
| oraclelinux7
| oraclelinux7-uyuni-client
| -

| {oracle} 8
| oraclelinux8
| oraclelinux8-uyuni-client
| oraclelinux8-appstream

|===

[NOTE]
====
{oracle} 6 is now at end-of-life, and the ISO images provided in the repository are out of date.
Bootstrapping new {oracle} 6 clients using these packages will fail.
If you need to bootstrap new {oracle} 6 clients, follow the troubleshooting procedure in xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
====

include::snippets/addchannels_novendor_cli.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
For {oracle} 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels.
You require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====
endif::[]

If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client.
If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the [package]``spacecmd`` package will fail.

== Create an Activation Key

You need to create an activation key that is associated with your {oracle} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].




== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

include::snippets/trust_gpg.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
For Oracle 8 clients use 
----
ol8-gpg-pubkey-82562EA9AD986DA3.key
----

For Oracle 6 or 7 clients use 
----
ol67-gpg-pubkey-72F97B74EC551F0A3.key
----
====



== Register Clients

{oracle} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].


[WARNING]
====
To register and use {oracle}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.
For more information about how to resolve this error, see ``Registering Older Clients`` at xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
