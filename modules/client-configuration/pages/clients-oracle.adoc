= Registering {oracle} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {oracle} operating systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You are responsible for arranging access to {oracle} base media repositories and {oracle} installation media.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {oracle}{nbsp}8.
{oracle}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====


== Server Requirements

Before you begin, check that your {productname} Server meets the requirements at xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

Taskomatic uses one CPU core, and requires at least 3072{nbsp}MB of RAM.
To ensure that taskomatic has access to enough memory, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, and add this line:

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----

Restart Taskomatic:
----
systemctl restart taskomatic
----



== Channel and Repository Management




ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels
. On the {productname} Server, add the appropriate {oracle} channels:
+
* For {oracle} 6:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``Oracle Linux 6 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``oraclelinux6-x86_64``.
+
* For {oracle} 7:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``Oracle Linux 7 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``oraclelinux7-x86_64``.
+
* For {oracle} 8:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``Oracle Linux 8 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``oraclelinux8-x86_64``.
. Synchronize the {productname} Server with the {SCC}.
You can do this using the {webui}, or by running [command]``mgr-sync`` at the command prompt.
. Add the new channel to your activation key.
endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
For {oracle} 8 clients, add both the ``BaseOS`` and ``Appstream`` channels.
You will require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====


.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
+
----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----
. Add the {oracle} base, updates, and client channels, specifying the {oracle} version and architecture:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 oracle8 \
oracle8-uyuni-client oracle8-appstream
----


[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====

endif::[]


There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
+
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt with [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log`` file.
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.



== Create an Activation Key

You will need to create an activation key that is associated with your {oracle} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].



== Register Clients

{oracle} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
