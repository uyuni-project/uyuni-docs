= Registering {ubuntu} 16.04 and 18.04 Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS operating systems.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

{productname} supports {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS, and 20.04 LTS clients using Salt.
For information about registering Salt clients running {ubuntu} 20.04, see xref:client-configuration:clients-ubuntu.adoc[].

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

{productname} supports {ubuntu} 16.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS clients using Salt.

endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Canonical does not endorse or support {productname}.
====

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} is supported for Salt clients only.
Traditional clients are not supported.
====

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {ubuntu} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.
However, the root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default, so to use bootstrapping, you require an existing user with [command]``sudo`` privileges for Python.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {ubuntu} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[ubuntu-old-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Ubuntu Products - WebUI
|===
| OS Version     | Product Name
| {ubuntu} 16.04 | Ubuntu 16.04
| {ubuntu} 18.04 | Ubuntu 18.04
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using WebUI to add Ubuntu 18.04 channels, you also need to add ubuntu-1804-amd64-main and ubuntu-1804-amd64-main-updates channels using CLI, as described in <<ubuntu-old-channels-cli-suma>>.
====

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} 16.04 is now at end-of-life, and the ISO images provided in the repository are out of date.
Bootstrapping new {ubuntu} 16.04 clients using these packages will fail.
If you need to bootstrap new {ubuntu} 16.04 clients, follow the troubleshooting procedure in xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
====

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

|===

[NOTE]
====
{ubuntu} 16.04 is now at end-of-life, and the ISO images provided in the repository are out of date.
Bootstrapping new {ubuntu} 16.04 clients using these packages will fail.

|===

Channels added using this method do not synchronize regularly by default.
You can configure a synchronization schedule using the {productname} {webui}.
Navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], click the channel you added, and select the menu:Repositories[Sync] subtab.
Set a daily or weekly synchronization schedule, and click btn:[Schedule].


[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.

[IMPORTANT]

You need all the new channels fully synchronized, including Universe (Universe contains important dependencies for Salt), before bootstrapping any Ubuntu client.

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

include::snippets/trust_gpg.adoc[]

endif::[]



== Root Access

The root user on {ubuntu} is disabled by default for SSH access.

To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file.

[NOTE]
====
This issue happens with self-installed versions of {ubuntu}.
If the default user has been granted administrative privileges during installation time, a password is requiered to perform privilege escalation using [command]``sudo``.
With cloud instances this does not happen because [command]``cloud-init`` automatically creates a file under [path]``/etc/sudoers.d`` and grants privilege escalation through [command]``sudo`` without the need for a password.
====

.Procedure: Granting Root User Access

. On the client, edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line at the end of the [filename]``sudoers`` file.
Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>  ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python
----

[NOTE]
====
This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client.
When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required.
We recommend that you remove the line from the [path]``sudoers`` file after the client has been successfully installed.
====



== Register Clients

To register your {ubuntu} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



[[clients-ubuntu-old-spacecmd-install]]
== Troubleshooting: Install `spacecmd` {ubuntu} 18.04 Clients

With default configuration settings, the installation of [package]``spacecmd`` may fail with:

----
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
    spacecmd : Depends: python3-rpm but it is not installable
----


[package]``python3-rpm`` is part of the {ubuntu} universe repositories.
To make this package available, enable universe repositories on the client.

////
All the packages we provide should be installable. If we removed the requirement for universe, then it means adding more dependencies to the client tools.
////


.Procedure: Enabling Universe Repositories

. On the {ubuntu} 18.04 client, open the [path]``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file, and uncomment the universe repositories.

. Execute the command [command]``apt-get update``.

Now [package]``spacecmd`` is installable.
