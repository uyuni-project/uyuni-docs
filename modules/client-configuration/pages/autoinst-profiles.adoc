= Autoinstallation Profiles

When you have prepared an autoinstallation file and distribution, you can create profiles to manage autoinstallation on your {productname} Server.
You can create multiple autoinstallation profiles, to manage different distributions.

To see and manage your autoinstallation profiles, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles].



== Create an Autoinstallation Profile

You can create your autoinstallation profile directly in the {productname} {webui}.
The simplest way to create a profile is to upload an {ay} or {kickstart} file.
Alternatively, for {kickstart} only, you can use the {webui} wizard.

Before you begin, you must have created an autoinstallation distribution, and prepared an autoinstallation file.
For more information about autoinstallation distributions and files, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-setup.adoc[].

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles].
. Click btn:[Upload Kickstart/Autoyast File].
. In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, type a name for the profile.
    Do not use spaces.
. In the [guimenu]``Autoinstall Tree`` field, select the autoinstallation distribution to use for this profile.
. In the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type`` field, select the type of virtualization to use for this profile, or select ``None`` for no virtualization.

[NOTE]
====
When you are creating your autoinstallation profile, you can check [guimenu]``Always use the newest Tree for this base channel``.
This setting allows {productname} to automatically pick the latest distribution that is associated with the specified base channel.
If you add new distributions later, {productname} will use the most recently created or modified.
====

You can change the details and settings of your autoinstallation profiles by navigating to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles] and clicking on the name of the profile you want to edit.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the Virtualization Type usually requires changes to the profile bootloader and partition options.
This can overwrite your customization.
Verify new or changed settings before saving them, by navigating to the [guimenu]``Partitioning`` tab.

== File Preservation for {kickstart}

If you have many custom configuration files located on a client you want to {kickstart}, you can save them as a list, and associate that list with the {kickstart} profile to be used.

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > File Preservation] and click btn:[Create File Preservation List].
Enter a suitable label, and list absolute paths to all files and directories you want to save.
Click btn:[Create List].

Include the file preservation list in your {kickstart} profile by navigating to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles] and selecting the profile you want to edit.
Navigate to the menu:System Details[File Preservation] subtab and select the file preservation list to include.


[NOTE]
====
File preservation lists are limited to a total size of 1{nbsp}MB.
Special devices like [path]``/dev/hda1`` and [path]``/dev/sda1`` are not supported.
Only use file and directory names, you cannot use regular expression wildcards.
