Instead of the {webui}, you can use the command line to register a Salt client to a proxy.
This procedure requires that you have installed the Salt package on the Salt client before registration.
For SLEÂ 12 based clients, you also must have activated the [systemitem]``Advanced Systems Management`` module.

[NOTE]
====
Registering traditional clients on the command line is also possible, but it requires more steps.
It is not covered here.
Use the bootstrap script procedure to register traditional clients.
For more information, see xref:client-proxy-script.adoc[].

.Procedure: Registering Clients to a Proxy Using the Command Line

. Choose a client configuration file located at:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion
----
+
or:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion.d/NAME.conf
----
+
This is sometimes also called a minion file.
. Add the proxy FQDN as the `master` to the client configuration file:
+
----
master: PROXY123.EXAMPLE.COM
----

. Restart the [systemitem]``salt-minion`` service:
+
----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----
. On the server, accept the new client key; replace [systemitem]``<client>`` with the name of your client:
+
----
salt-key -a '<client>'
----
