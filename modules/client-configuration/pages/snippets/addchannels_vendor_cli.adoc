.Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, use the [command]``mgr-sync`` command to add the appropriate channels:
+
----
mgr-sync add \
<base_channel_name> \
<child_channel_name_1> \
<child_channel_name_2> \
... <child_channel_name_n>
----
. Synchronization starts automatically.
  If you want to synchronize the channels manually, use:
+
----
mgr-sync sync --with-children <channel_name>
----
. Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing.
