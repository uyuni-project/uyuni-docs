[WARNING]
====
This version of {productname} is compatible with Salt and traditional clients (on some operating systems). SUSE will deprecate traditional clients in the next {productname} 4.3 release.

The release that follows {productname} 4.3 will not support traditional clients and is planned for 2023. 

We encourage all new deployments to use Salt clients exclusively, and to migrate existing traditional clients to Salt.
