[WARNING]
====
This version of {productname} is compatible with {salt} and traditional clients (on some operating systems). SUSE will deprecate traditional clients in the next {productname} {productnumber} release.

The release that follows {productname} {productnumber} will not support traditional clients and is planned for 2023. 

We encourage all new deployments to use {salt} clients exclusively, and to migrate existing traditional clients to {salt}.
