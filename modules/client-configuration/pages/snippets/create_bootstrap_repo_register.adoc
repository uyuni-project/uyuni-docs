To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt on the container host:

----
mgrctl exec -ti mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
