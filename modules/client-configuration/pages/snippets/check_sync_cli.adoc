.Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt
. To list available logs before tailing, on the container host, run the following command:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -- ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/
----

+

. At the command prompt on the {productname} container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file:

. With the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` command you can add the appropriate channels.
  At the command prompt on the {productname} container host, as root, execute the following command.
  Ensure you specify the correct architecture:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log
----

+

. Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress.
  You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.
