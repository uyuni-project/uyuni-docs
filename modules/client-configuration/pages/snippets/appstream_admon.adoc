[IMPORTANT]
====
The AppStream repository provides modular packages.
This results in the {productname} {webui} showing incorrect package information.
You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the {webui} or API.

You can use the AppStream filter with content lifecycle management (CLM) to transform modular repositories into regular repositories.
Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages on Salt clients, or use the [command]``dnf`` command on the client.
For more information about CLM, see xref:administration:content-lifecycle.adoc[].
