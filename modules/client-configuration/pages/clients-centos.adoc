= Registering {centos} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {centos} operating systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{centos} clients are based on {centos} and are unrelated to {sleses}, RES, {redhat}, or {es}.
You are responsible for arranging access to {centos} base media repositories and {centos} installation media, as well as connecting {productname} Server to the {centos} content delivery network.
====

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} does not provide support for {centos} operating systems.
{productname} allows you to manage {centos} clients, but support is not provided.
====

endif::[]



== Server Requirements

Before you begin, check that your {productname} Server meets the requirements at xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

Taskomatic uses one CPU core, and requires at least 3072{nbsp}MB of RAM.
To ensure that taskomatic has access to enough memory, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, and add this line:

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----

Restart Taskomatic:
----
systemctl restart taskomatic
----



== Channel and Repository Management

The [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package contains a number of command line tools required for client administration, including the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` tool.


ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} only provides support for [command]``spacewalk-clone-by-date`` and [command]``spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle`` tools.
====

endif::[]



.Procedure: Adding Channels and Repositories
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
+
----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----

// Because of the way mgr-create-bootstrap-repo works and because we don't have CentOS products at SCC, SUSE Manager users MUST use the same procedure as at Uyuni
// They CANNOT use RES Client Tools.
. Add the {centos} base, updates, and client channels, specifying the {centos} version and architecture:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 centos7 \
centos7-uyuni-client centos7-uyuni-client
----

[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====



.Procedure: Synchronizing {centos} repositories

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage], and check every {centos} channel.
. In the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` subtab, and click btn:[Sync Now].
You can also create a regular synchronization schedule on this page.



== Create an Activation Key

You will need to create an activation key that is associated with your {centos} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].



ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

By default, {centos} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {centos} client tools.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.

However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

To fix this, add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all {centos} bootstrap scripts:
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----

 You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are boostrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a salt state to trust the key.
Create the salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.

endif::[]



== Register Clients

{centos} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



== Manage Errata

When you update {centos} clients, the packages do not include metadata about the updates.
You can use a third-party errata service to obtain this information.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The third-party errata service described here is provided and maintained by the community.
It is not supported by {suse}.
====
endif::[]



.Procedure: Installing an Errata Service

. From the command prompt, as root, add the ``sle-module-development-tools`` module:
+
----
SUSEConnect --product sle-module-development-tools/15.1/x86_64
----
. Install the errata service:
+
----
zypper in  perl-Text-Unidecode
----
. Create a file for your errata script:
+
----
touch /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh
----
. Edit the new file to include this script, editing the repository details as required.
This script fetches the errata details from an external errata service, unpacks it, and publishes the details:
+
----
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /usr/local/centos
cd /usr/local/centos
rm *.xml
wget -c http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata.latest.xml
#wget -c https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-all.xml
wget -c https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL7.xml
wget -c http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata-import.tar
tar xvf errata-import.tar
chmod +x /usr/local/centos/errata-import.pl
export SPACEWALK_USER='<adminname>';export SPACEWALK_PASS='<password>'
/usr/local/centos/errata-import.pl --server '<servername>' \
--errata /usr/local/centos/errata.latest.xml  \
--include-channels=centos7-x86_64-updates,centos7-x86_64,centos7-x86_64-extras \
--publish --rhsa-oval /usr/local/centos/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL7.xml
----
. Set up a cron job to run the script daily:
+
----
ln -s /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh /etc/cron.daily
----

For more information on this tool, see https://cefs.steve-meier.de/.
