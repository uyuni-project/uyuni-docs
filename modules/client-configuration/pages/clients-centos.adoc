= Registering {centos} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {centos} operating systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{centos} clients are based on {centos} and are unrelated to {sleses}, RES, {redhat}, or {es}.
You are responsible for arranging access to {centos} base media repositories and {centos} installation media, as well as connecting {productname} Server to the {centos} content delivery network.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {centos}{nbsp}8.
{centos}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====


== Server Requirements

Before you begin, check that your {productname} Server meets the requirements at xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

Taskomatic uses one CPU core, and requires at least 3072{nbsp}MB of RAM.
To ensure that taskomatic has access to enough memory, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, and add this line:

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----

Restart Taskomatic:
----
systemctl restart taskomatic
----



== Channel and Repository Management

Before you register {centos} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {centos} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.



ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels
. On the {productname} Server, add the appropriate {centos} channels:
+
* For {centos} 6:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``CentOS 6 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``centos6-x86_64``.
+
* For {centos} 7:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``CentOS 7 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``centos7-x86_64``.
+
* For {centos} 8:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``CentOS 8 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``centos8-x86_64``.
. Synchronize the {productname} Server with the {SCC}.
You can do this using the {webui}, or by running [command]``mgr-sync`` at the command prompt.
. Add the new channel to your activation key.
endif::[]



ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {centos} 8 clients, add both the ``BaseOS`` and ``Appstream`` channels.
You will require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====



.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
+
----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----
// Because of the way mgr-create-bootstrap-repo works and because we don't have CentOS products at SCC, SUSE Manager users MUST use the same procedure as at Uyuni
// They CANNOT use RES Client Tools.
. Add the {centos} base, updates, and client channels, specifying the {centos} version and architecture:
+
* For {centos} 6:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 centos6 \
centos6-uyuni-client centos6-updates
----
+
* For {centos} 7:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 centos7 \
centos7-uyuni-client centos7-updates
----
+
* For {centos} 8:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -a x86_64 centos8 \
centos8-uyuni-client centos8-appstream
----

[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====
endif::[]


There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``Products`` tab.
+
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], then click the channel associated to the repository.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, then click [guimenu]``Sync`` and check [systemitem]``Sync Status``.
endif::[]
* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt:
+
----
tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log
----
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.



== Create an Activation Key

You will need to create an activation key that is associated with your {centos} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].



ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

By default, {centos} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {centos} client tools.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.

However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

To fix this, add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all {centos} bootstrap scripts:
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----

You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are bootstrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key.
Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.
endif::[]



== Register Clients

{centos} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



== Manage Errata

When you update {centos} clients, the packages do not include metadata about the updates.
You can use a third-party errata service to obtain this information.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The third-party errata service described here is provided and maintained by the community.
It is not supported by {suse}.
====
endif::[]



.Procedure: Installing an Errata Service

. From the command prompt, as root, add the ``sle-module-development-tools`` module:
+
----
SUSEConnect --product sle-module-development-tools/15.1/x86_64
----
. Install the errata service:
+
----
zypper in  perl-Text-Unidecode
----
. Create a file for your errata script:
+
----
touch /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh
----
. Edit the new file to include this script, editing the repository details as required.
This script fetches the errata details from an external errata service, unpacks it, and publishes the details:
+
----
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /usr/local/centos
cd /usr/local/centos
rm *.xml
wget -c http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata.latest.xml
#wget -c https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-all.xml
wget -c https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL7.xml
wget -c http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata-import.tar
tar xvf errata-import.tar
chmod +x /usr/local/centos/errata-import.pl
export SPACEWALK_USER='<adminname>';export SPACEWALK_PASS='<password>'
/usr/local/centos/errata-import.pl --server '<servername>' \
--errata /usr/local/centos/errata.latest.xml  \
--include-channels=centos7-x86_64-updates,centos7-x86_64,centos7-x86_64-extras \
--publish --rhsa-oval /usr/local/centos/com.redhat.rhsa-RHEL7.xml
----
. Set up a cron job to run the script daily:
+
----
ln -s /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh /etc/cron.daily
----

For more information on this tool, see https://cefs.steve-meier.de/.
