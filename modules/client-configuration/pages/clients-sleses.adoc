= Registering {sleses} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {sleses} ({es}) operating systems.
{es} clients are based on {rhel} or {centos}.
They are sometimes also called SLESES, RES or {redhat} {es}.

The {es} software channels provided by {suse} only provide updates to packages, they do not provide the packages themselves.
To register {es} clients, you need to create custom empty base and child channels on your {productname} Server, then import the {redhat} or {centos} packages into the custom channels.
You must obtain the initial packages directly from {redhat} or {centos} before you can apply the updates provided by the {es} software channels.


[IMPORTANT]
====
You are responsible for arranging access to {redhat} or {centos} base media repositories and installation media.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must obtain support from {suse} for all your {es} systems.

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} does not provide support for {es} systems on {uyuni}.
====
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {es}{nbsp}8.
{es}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====



== Add Software Channels


For {es} clients, some required packages are contained on the {rhel} or {centos} installation media.
You must have these packages installed before you can register a {es} client.

The {es} product is provided by {scc}.
This also includes the client tools package.

Before you register {es} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the corresponding {es} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

You need to select two different sets of channels, one for {es} and the other for the Client Tools.

You will need an activation key associated with the correct {es} channels.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[es-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.ES Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version
| Product Name

| {es} 6
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Expanded Support 6 x86_64

| {es} 7
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Expanded Support 7 x86_64

| {es} 8
| RHEL or SLES ES or CentOS 8 Base and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Expanded Support 8 x86_64

|===

{productname} requires tools channels that contain additional software.
This procedure creates these tools channels:

[[es-channels-tools]]
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
.ES Tools Channels
|===
| OS Version | Base Channel                     | Tools Channel
| {es} 6     | RHEL Expanded Support 6          | RES6 SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64
| {es} 7     | RHEL Expanded Support 7          | RES7 SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64
| {es} 8     | RHEL or SLES ES or CentOS 8 Base | RHEL8-Pool for x86_64

The channels you need for this procedure are:

[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.ES Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Tools Channel

| {es} 6

| {es} 8
| rhel-x86_64-server-8
| -
| res8-suse-manager-tools-x86_64

|===

include::snippets/add_channels_cli.adoc[]

endif::[]



=== Add Base Media

The base {es} channel does not contain any packages, because {suse} does not provide {rhel} or {centos} base media.
You will need to obtain base media from {redhat} or {centos}, which you can add as a child channel to the {es} parent channel.
To ensure you have all the packages you need, use a full DVD image, not a minimal or {jeos} image.

You can use {productname} custom channels to set up the {rhel} or {centos} media.
All packages on the base media must be mirrored into a child channel.

You can freely choose the names for the channels.

include::snippets/manual_channels.adoc[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
For {redhat} 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels.
You will require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====


.Procedure: Adding Base Media to Custom Channels
. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, copy the base media image to the [path]``/tmp/`` directory.
. Create a directory to contain the media content.
    Replace [command]``<os_name>`` with either ``sleses6``,  ``sleses7``, or ``sleses8``:
+
----
mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/pub/<os_name>
----
. Mount the image:
+
----
mount -o loop /tmp/<iso_filename> /srv/www/htdocs/pub/<os_name>
----
. Import the packages into the child channel you created earlier:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c <channel-label> -u /srv/www/htdocs/pub/<os_name>
----


==== OPTIONAL: Add Base Media from a Content URL

Alternatively, if you have access to a content URL provided by {redhat} CDN or {centos}, you can create a custom repository to mirror the packages.

The details you need for this procedure are:

[[es-repos-manual]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.ES Custom Repository Settings
|===
| Option                 | Parameter
| Repository URL         | The content URL provided by {redhat} CDN or {centos}
| Has Signed Metadata?   | Uncheck all {redhat} Enterprise repositories
| SSL CA Certificate     | [systemitem]``redhat-uep`` ({redhat} only)
| SSL Client Certificate | [systemitem]``Entitlement-Cert-date`` ({redhat} only)
| SSL Client Key         | ``Entitlement-Key-date`` ({redhat} only)

[NOTE]
====
The {es} channels can be very large.
The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours.

When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.
This gives you a backup of the original synchronization data.
====



== Register {es} Clients

Your {es} clients are now ready to be registered.

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].


[WARNING]
====
To register and use {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.
For more information about how to resolve this error, see ``Registering Older Clients`` at xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
