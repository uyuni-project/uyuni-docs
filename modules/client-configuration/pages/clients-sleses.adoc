= Registering {sll} Clients

This section contains information about registering clients running {sll} operating systems.
{sll} clients are based on {rhel} or {centos}.


[NOTE]
====
{sll} clients are sometimes also called {sleses} (SLESES), Liberty, RES or {redhat} {es}.
====

The {sll} software channels provided by {suse} only provide updates to packages, they do not provide the packages themselves.
To register {sll} clients, you need to register the {sll} Product (outlined below) to create the necessary base channel, then import any required {redhat} or {centos} packages as custom child channels.
You must obtain the initial packages directly from {redhat} or {centos} before you can apply the updates provided by the {sll} software channels.

// FIXME!

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
// Use list format: repository URLs / packages and metadata / version info
[IMPORTANT]
====
* {sll} repository URLs are available from {scc}
* Packages and metadata are provided by {suse}
* For supported products, see the support table and the release notes
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You are responsible for arranging access to {redhat} or {centos} base media repositories and installation media.

{suse} does not provide support for {sll} systems on {uyuni}.

== Add Software Channels

For {sll} clients, some required packages are contained on the {rhel} or {centos} installation media.
You must have these packages installed before you can register a {sll} client.

The {sll} product is provided by {scc}.
This also includes the client tools package.

Before you register {sll} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

You need to select two different sets of channels, one for {sll} and the other for the Client Tools.

You need an activation key associated with the correct {sll} channels.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].

[[add.base.media]]
=== Add Base Media

The {sll} software channels only provide updates, not the packages themselves.
To register {sll} clients, first register the {sll} Product (outlined below) to create the base channel, then import the necessary Red Hat or CentOS packages as custom child channels.
Initial packages must be obtained directly from {redhat} or {centos} before applying updates from {sll}.
Importantly, you do not need to maintain your Red Hat subscriptions, but consult your legal department to check for any ongoing payment obligations to Red Hat during migration.
To ensure you have all the packages you need, use a full DVD image, not a minimal or {jeos} image.

You can use {productname} custom channels to set up the {rhel} or {centos} media.
All packages on the base media must be mirrored into a child channel.

You can freely choose the names for the channels.

include::snippets/manual_channels.adoc[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
For {redhat} 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels.
You require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====

If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client.
If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the [package]``spacecmd`` package will fail.


.Procedure: Adding Base Media to Custom Channels
. Copy the base media image to the {productname} Server container host to the [path]``/tmp/`` directory.
. To get the base media image into the {productname} Server container, use:
+
----
mgradm distribution copy /tmp/SLES-ES-7.9-x86_64-DVD.iso sles-es-7
----
+
The destination in the container will be [path]``/srv/www/distributions/sles-es-7``.
. Import the packages into the child channel you created earlier:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c <channel-label> -u file:///srv/www/distributions/sles-es-7/
----


==== OPTIONAL: Add Base Media from a Content URL

Alternatively, if you have access to a content URL provided by {redhat} CDN or {centos}, you can create a custom repository to mirror the packages.

The details you need for this procedure are:

[[es-repos-manual]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.ES Custom Repository Settings
|===

| Option                 | Parameter
| Repository URL         | The content URL provided by {redhat} CDN or {centos}
| Has Signed Metadata?   | Uncheck all {redhat} Enterprise repositories
| SSL CA Certificate     | [systemitem]``redhat-uep`` ({redhat} only)
| SSL Client Certificate | [systemitem]``Entitlement-Cert-date`` ({redhat} only)
| SSL Client Key         | ``Entitlement-Key-date`` ({redhat} only)

[NOTE]
====
The {sll} channels can be very large.
The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours.

When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.
This gives you a backup of the original synchronization data.

[[clients-sleses-el-migration]]
== Migrate Enterprise Linux (EL) clients to {sll}

If an Enterprise Linux (EL) client such as RHEL and all clones (like {centos}, {almalinux}, {rocky}, and {oracle}) is already registered as a minion on {productname} and users want to migrate it to {sll} they can use a re-activation key to apply the activation key that drives the migration.

For more information about re-activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc#activation-keys-reactivation[].

The re-activation key is per minion, and can be generated with the {webui} or using the API.
For more information, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/5.0/api/suse-manager/api/system.html#apidoc-system-obtainReactivationKey-loggedInUser-sid.

To re-activate a client, the user can run the bootstrap script on the client and pass the re-activation key as an environment variable.  Example:

----
REACTIVATION_KEY=<KEY> ./bootstrap_liberate9.sh
----

Another method is to add some special flags to the {salt} client configuration file located at [path]``/etc/venv-salt-minon/minion.d/susemanager.conf`` (or [path]``/etc/salt-minon/minion.d/susemanager.conf``) the following content (join this content with the already existing one):

----
grains:
    susemanager:
        activation_key: "<KEY_ID>"
        management_key: "MINION_REACTIVATION_KEY"
----

After changing the [path]``susemanager.conf`` file, the [systemitem]``salt-minion`` service needs to be restarted on the {salt} server.  By default with:

----
systemctl restart venv-salt-minon
----

Or for legacy {salt} with:

----
systemctl restart salt-minon
----




=== The [systemitem]``liberate`` formula

Migrating Enterprise Linux (EL) clients to {sll} with the [systemitem]``liberate`` formula.
