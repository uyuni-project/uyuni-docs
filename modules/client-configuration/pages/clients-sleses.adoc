= Registering {sleses} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {sleses} ({es}) operating systems.

{es} clients are based on {rhel} or {centos}.

They are sometimes also called SLESES, RES or {redhat} {es}.


[IMPORTANT]
====
You are responsible for arranging access to {redhat} or {centos} base media repositories and installation media.
====

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must obtain support from {suse} for all your {es} systems.
====
endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} does not provide support for {es} systems on {uyuni}.
====
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditional clients are not available on {es}{nbsp}8.
{es}{nbsp}8 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====



== Server Requirements

Before you begin, check that your {productname} Server meets the requirements at xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

Taskomatic uses one CPU core, and requires at least 3072{nbsp}MB of RAM.
To ensure that taskomatic has access to enough memory, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, and add this line:

----
taskomatic.java.maxmemory=3072
----

Restart Taskomatic:
----
systemctl restart taskomatic
----



== Add Client Tools


For {es} clients, some required packages are contained on the {rhel} or {centos} installation media.
You must have these packages installed before you can register a {es} client.

The {es} product is provided by {scc}.
This also includes the client tools package.

Before you register {es} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the corresponding {es} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

You need to select two different sets of channels, one for {es} and the other for the Client Tools.

You will need an activation key associated with the correct {es} channels.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:clients-and-activation-keys.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
For {es} 8 clients, add both the ``BaseOS`` and ``Appstream`` channels.
You will require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====


.Procedure: Adding Client Tools Channels

. On the {productname} Server, add the appropriate {es} channels:
+
* For {es} 6:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``RHEL6 Base x86_64`` and [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Client Tools RES6 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-6`` and [systemitem]``res6-suse-manager-tools-x86_64``.
+
* For {es} 7:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``RHEL7 Base x86_64`` and [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Client Tools RES7 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-7`` and [systemitem]``res7-suse-manager-tools-x86_64``.
* For {es} 8:
+
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``RHEL8 Base x86_64`` and [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Client Tools RES8 x86_64``.
+
From the command prompt, add [systemitem]``rhel-x86_64-server-8`` and [systemitem]``res8-suse-manager-tools-x86_64``.
. Synchronize the {productname} Server with the {SCC}.
You can do this using the {webui}, or by running [command]``mgr-sync`` at the command prompt.
. Add the new channel to your activation key.


There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

// This isn't included in the RH section, should it be (at ~L180) ? LKB 2019-09-30

* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
+
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt with [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log`` file.
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.


[NOTE]
====
The {es} channels can be very large.
The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to 24 hours.

When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.
This gives you a backup of the original synchronization data.
====



=== Add Base Media


The base {es} channel does not contain any packages, because {suse} does not provide {rhel} or {centos} base media.
You will need to obtain base media from {redhat} or {centos}, which you can add as a child channel to the {es} parent channel.

You can use {productname} custom channels to set up the {rhel} or {centos} media.
All packages on the base media are mirrored into a child channel.



.Procedure: Creating a {rhel} or {centos} Custom Channel

[IMPORTANT]
====
* SLES ES 6 and 7, require only one child channel for the os repository
* SLES ES 8 requires two child channels for both the BaseOS and AppStream repositories
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].
. Click btn:[Create Channel] and set these parameters:
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Name`` field, type a name for your channel, specifying the OS name and architecture.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Label`` field, type a label for your channel, specifying the OS name and architecture.
* In the [guimenu]``Parent Channel`` field, select the corresponding {rhel} or {centos} distribution channel for your architecture.
The parent channel will not contain any packages.
* In the [guimenu]``Architecture`` field, select the appropriate architecture.
* In the [guimenu]``Repository Checksum Type`` field, select [systemitem]``sha1``.
* In the [guimenu]``Channel Summary`` field, type a summary for your channel, specifying the OS name and architecture.
* In the [guimenu]``Organization Sharing`` field, select [systemitem]``Public``.
. Click btn:[Create Channel].
. Add the new channel to your activation key.



.**Procedure: Adding Base Media to Custom Channels**

Mount the {rhel} or {centos} 6, 7 or 8 Media:

. On the {productname} Server command prompt, as root, copy the base media image to the [path]``/tmp`` directory.

. Create a directory to contain the media content.
Replace [command]``<os_name>`` with either ``rhel``  or ``centos``:
+
----
mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----

. Mount the image:
+
----
mount -o loop /tmp/<iso_filename> /srv/www/htdocs/pub/rhel
----

. Proceed to Syncing Base media for {rhel} or {centos} 6,7, or 8.



.**Procedure: Syncing Base Media**

The following steps require you to have mounted the base media for the selected distribution.

* For {rhel} or {centos} 8:
+
. At the command prompt as root enter the following to sync the **BaseOS** channel:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://EXAMPLE.COM/pub/rhel/BaseOS/
----

. Wait for the sync to complete.

. At the command prompt as root enter the following to sync the **AppStream** channel:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://EXAMPLE.COM/pub/rhel/AppStream/
----

. Wait for the sync to complete.

* For {rhel} or {centos} 7:
+
At the command prompt as root enter the following:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://EXAMPLE.COM/pub/<os_name>/
----

* For {rhel} or {centos} 6:
+
At the command prompt as root enter the following:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c channel_name -u https://<SERVER-FQDN>/pub/<os_name>/Server/
----





=== Troubleshooting Synchronization

// This isn't included in the RH section, should it be (at ~L260) ? LKB 2019-09-30

Sometimes, the [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` command will stop running during a synchronization, and give this error:

----
[Errno 256] No more mirrors to try.
----

If this occurs, run [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` in debugging mode to determine the error.

Start debugging mode:
----
export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG
----

Check the output:
----
/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label> --type yum
----

Disable debug mode:
----
unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG
----
