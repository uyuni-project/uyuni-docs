= Registering {sll} Clients

This section contains information about registering traditional and Salt clients running {sll} operating systems.
{sll} clients are based on {rhel} or {centos}.


[NOTE]
====
{sll} clients are sometimes also called {sleses} (SLESES), Liberty, RES or {redhat} {es}.
====

The {sll} software channels provided by {suse} only provide updates to packages, they do not provide the packages themselves.
To register {sll} clients, you need to register the {sll} Product (outlined below) to create the necessary base channel, then import any required {redhat} or {centos} packages as custom child channels.
You must obtain the initial packages directly from {redhat} or {centos} before you can apply the updates provided by the {sll} software channels.

// FIXME!

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
// Use list format: repository URLs / packages and metadata / version info
[IMPORTANT]
====
* {sll} repository URLs are available from {scc}
* Packages and metadata are provided by {suse}
* For supported products, see the support table and the release notes
====
endif::[]




[IMPORTANT]
====
You are responsible for arranging access to {redhat} or {centos} base media repositories and installation media.

Traditional clients are not available on {sll}{nbsp}8 or 9.
{sll}{nbsp}8 and 9 clients are only supported as Salt clients.



== Add Software Channels

For {sll} clients, some required packages are contained on the {rhel} or {centos} installation media.
You must have these packages installed before you can register a {sll} client.

The {sll} product is provided by {scc}.
This also includes the client tools package.

Before you register {sll} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

You need to select two different sets of channels, one for {sll} and the other for the Client Tools.

You need an activation key associated with the correct {sll} channels.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].

[[add.base.media]]
=== Add Base Media

// 2022-04-26, ke: Here we can keep the "jeos" abbrev (rh product line)
The base {sll} channel does not contain any packages, because {suse} does not provide {rhel} or {centos} base media.
You need to obtain base media from {redhat} or {centos}, which you can add as a child channel to the {sll} parent channel.
To ensure you have all the packages you need, use a full DVD image, not a minimal or {jeos} image.

You can use {productname} custom channels to set up the {rhel} or {centos} media.
All packages on the base media must be mirrored into a child channel.

You can freely choose the names for the channels.

include::snippets/manual_channels.adoc[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
For {redhat} 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels.
You require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====

If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client.
If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the [package]``spacecmd`` package will fail.


.Procedure: Adding Base Media to Custom Channels
. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, copy the base media image to the [path]``/tmp/`` directory.
. Create a directory to contain the media content.
    Replace [command]``<os_name>`` with either ``sll7``, ``sll8``, or ``sll9``:
+
----
mkdir -p /srv/www/htdocs/pub/<os_name>
----
. Mount the image:
+
----
mount -o loop /tmp/<iso_filename> /srv/www/htdocs/pub/<os_name>
----
. Import the packages into the child channel you created earlier:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c <channel-label> -u file:///srv/www/htdocs/pub/<os_name>/<repopath>/
----


==== OPTIONAL: Add Base Media from a Content URL

Alternatively, if you have access to a content URL provided by {redhat} CDN or {centos}, you can create a custom repository to mirror the packages.

The details you need for this procedure are:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.ES Custom Repository Settings
|===

| Option                 | Parameter
| Repository URL         | The content URL provided by {redhat} CDN or {centos}
| Has Signed Metadata?   | Uncheck all {redhat} Enterprise repositories
| SSL CA Certificate     | [systemitem]``redhat-uep`` ({redhat} only)
| SSL Client Certificate | [systemitem]``Entitlement-Cert-date`` ({redhat} only)
| SSL Client Key         | ``Entitlement-Key-date`` ({redhat} only)

[NOTE]
====
The {sll} channels can be very large.
The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours.

When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.
This gives you a backup of the original synchronization data.
