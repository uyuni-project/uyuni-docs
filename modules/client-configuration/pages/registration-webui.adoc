= Register Clients with the {webui}

Registering clients with the {productname} {webui} works for Salt clients only.

If you are bootstrapping Salt clients using the {webui}, it is using xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-ssh.adoc[Salt SSH] to execute the bootstrap process on the client.
Salt SSH uses the Salt Bundle and its included Python interpreter. Therefore, no other Python interpreter needs to be installed on the client.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As Salt Bundle is shipped with the bootstrap repository, the repository must be created before starting the bootstrap process for the client.
A shell script detects the operating system on the client and deploys the Salt Bundle from the appropriate bootstrap repository, using the same logic as the bootstrap script.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository[Prepare to Create a Bootstrap Repository].

[WARNING]
====
Do not register the {productname} Server to itself.
The {productname} Server must be managed individually or by using another separate {productname} Server.
For more information about using multiple servers, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/multi-server.adoc[].

.Procedure: Registering Clients with the {webui}

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, type the SSH port number to use to connect and bootstrap the client.
    By default, the SSH  port is [systemitem]``22``.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, type the username to log in to the client.
    By default, the username is [systemitem]``root``.
. To bootstrap the client with SSH, in the [guimenu]``Authentication`` field, check [guimenu]``SSH Private Key``, and upload the SSH private key to use to log in to the client.
    If your SSH private key requires a passphrase, type it into the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key Passphrase`` field, or leave it blank for no passphrase.
. To bootstrap the client with a password, in the [guimenu]``Authentication`` field, check [guimenu]``Password``, and type the password to log in to the client.
. In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` field, select the activation key that is associated with the software channel you want to use to bootstrap the client.
    For more information, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
. OPTIONAL: In the [guimenu]``Proxy`` field, select the proxy to register the client to.
. By default, the [guimenu]``Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking`` checkbox is selected.
    This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate.
. OPTIONAL: Check the [guimenu]``Manage System Completely via SSH`` checkbox.
    If you check this option, the client is configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other connection method is configured.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap] to begin registration.

When the bootstrap process has completed, your client is listed at menu:Systems[System List].


[IMPORTANT]
====
SSH private keys are stored only for the duration of the bootstrapping process.
They are deleted from the {productname} Server as soon as bootstrapping is complete.
====


[WARNING]
====
When new packages or updates are installed on the client using {productname}, any end user license agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted.
To review a package EULA, open the package details page in the {webui}.
====


[WARNING]
====
To register and use {centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, or {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.
For more information, see ``Registering Older Clients`` at xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].

== Handling of Locally assigned Repositories

Having repositories assigned directly to clients not served by {productname} is not a common use case.
It can cause trouble.
Therfore bootstrapping via Salt disables all local repositories at the beginning of the bootstrap process.

Later, during every use of the channel state, for example when executing a Highstate or a package installation, all locally assigned repositories are disabled again.

All software packages which are used on the clients should come from channels served by {productname}.
For more information about creating a custom channel, see ``Custom Channels`` at xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].
