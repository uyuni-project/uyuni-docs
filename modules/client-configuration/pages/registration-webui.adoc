= Register Clients with the {webui}

Registering clients with the {productname} {webui} works for Salt clients only.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not register a {productname} Server to itself.
The {productname} Server must be managed individually.
====



.Procedure: Registering Clients with the {webui}

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, type the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, type the SSH port number to use to connect and bootstrap the client.
By default, the SSH  port is [systemitem]``22``.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, type the username to log in to the client.
By default, the username is [systemitem]``root``.
. In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, type password to log in to the client.
. In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` field, select the activation key that is associated with the software channel you want to use to bootstrap the client.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
. OPTIONAL: In the [guimenu]``Proxy`` field, select the proxy to register the client to.
. By default, the [guimenu]``Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking`` checkbox is selected.
This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate.
. OPTIONAL: Check the [guimenu]``Manage System Completely via SSH`` checkbox.
If you check this option, the client will be configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other connection method will be configured.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap] to begin registration.

When the bootstrap process has completed, your client will be listed at menu:Systems[System List].


[WARNING]
====
When new packages or updates are installed on the client using {productname}, any end user license agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted.
To review a package EULA, open the package details page in the {webui}.

[WARNING]
====
To register and use {centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, or {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.
For more information about how to resolve this error, see ``Registering Older Clients`` at xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
