= Debian Client Registration

include::{localesdir}[]


You can register {debian} clients to your {productname} Server.
The method and details varies depending on the operating system of the client.

Before you start, ensure that the client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server.

You must also have created an activation key.
For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not register the {productname} Server to itself.
The {productname} Server must be managed individually.
