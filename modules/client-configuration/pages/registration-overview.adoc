= Client Registration Overview

There are several ways to register clients to your {productname} Server.
This section covers the various available methods.
It also contains information specific to the operating system you intend to run on the client.

Before you begin, check that:

* The client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server before registration.
* You have created an activation key.
For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not register the {productname} Server to itself.
The {productname} Server must be managed individually or by using another separate {productname} Server.
For more information about using multiple servers, see xref:large-deployments:multi-server.adoc[].
