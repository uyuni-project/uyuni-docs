= Client Registration

There are several ways to register clients to your {productname} Server.
This section covers the various available methods.
It also contains information specific to the operating system you intend to run on the client.

Before you begin, check that:

* The client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server before registration.
* You have created an activation key.
  For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].


.Handling the Installer Updates Channel after Bootstrapping
[IMPORTANT]
====
Once a client system has been bootstrapped, the **Installer Updates** channel should be removed. 
The standard update channel already includes the necessary updates, making this channel redundant.

Additionally, during migrations, this channel is unnecessary and should not be used.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not register the {productname} Server to itself.
The {productname} Server must be managed individually or by using another separate {productname} Server.
For more information about using multiple servers, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/multi-server.adoc[].
