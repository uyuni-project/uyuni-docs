= Client Registration Overview

There are several ways to register clients to your {productname} Server.
The preferred methods are described in the following sections:

* For Salt clients, we recommend that you register clients using the {productname} {webui}.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-webui.adoc[].
* If you want more control over the process, have to register many clients, or are registering traditional clients, we recommend that you create a bootstrap script.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
* For Salt clients and even more control over the process, executing single commands on the command line can be useful.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-cli.adoc[].

The client must have the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} server before registration.

You must create an activation key first, to use bootstrap script or command line method.
For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not register a {productname} Server to itself.
The {productname} Server must be managed individually.
