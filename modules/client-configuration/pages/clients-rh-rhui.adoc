= Registering {rhel} Clients with RHUI

If you are running {rhel} clients directly, rather than using {sleses}, you need to use Red Hat sources to retrieve and update packages.
This section contains information about using {redhat} update infrastructure (RHUI) to register traditional and Salt clients running {rhel} operating systems.
If you are running your clients in a public cloud, such as Amazon EC2, use this method.

It is possible to use RHUI in conjunction with the {redhat} content delivery network (CDN) to manage your {rhel} subscriptions.
For information about using {redhat} CDN, see xref:client-configuration:clients-rh-cdn.adoc[].



[IMPORTANT]
====
{rhel} clients are based on {redhat} and are unrelated to {sleses}, RES, or {sles}.
You are responsible for connecting {productname} Server to the {redhat} update infrastructure.
All clients that get updates using this RHUI certificate need to be correctly licensed, please check with your cloud provider and the {redhat} terms of service for more information.
====

[NOTE]
====
When {rhel} clients registered with RHUI are switched off, {redhat} might declare the certificate invalid.
In this case, you need to turn the client on again, or get a new RHUI certificate.
====


[NOTE]
====
Traditional clients are available on {rhel}{nbsp}6 and 7 only.
{rhel}{nbsp}8 clients are supported as Salt clients.
====



== Import Entitlements and Certificates

{redhat} clients require a {redhat} certificate authority (CA) and entitlement certificate, and an entitlement key.

{redhat} clients use a URL to replicate repositories.
The URL will change depending on where the {redhat} client is registered.

{redhat} clients can be registered in three different ways:

* {redhat} content delivery network (CDN) at redhat.com
* {redhat} Satellite Server
* {redhat} update infrastructure (RHUI) in the cloud

This guide covers clients registered to {redhat} update infrastructure (RHUI).
You must have at least one system registered to RHUI, with an authorized subscription for repository content.

For information about using {redhat} content delivery network (CDN) instead, see xref:client-configuration:clients-rh-cdn.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
Satellite certificates for client systems require a Satellite server and subscription.
Clients using Satellite certificates are not supported with {productname} Server.
====


The entitlement certificates and keys need to be copied from the client system to a location that the {productname} Server can access.

Your entitlement certificate and the {redhat} CA Certificate file have file extensions of [path]``.crt``.
The key has a file extension of [path]``.key``.



.Procedure: Copying Certificates to the Server
. Copy your entitlement certificate and key from the client system, to a location that the {productname} Server can access:
+
----
cp /etc/pki/rhui/product/content-<version>.crt /<example>/entitlement/
cp /etc/pki/rhui/content-<version>.key /<example>/entitlement/
----
+
. Copy the {redhat} CA Certificate file from the client system, to the same location as the entitlement certificate and key:
+
----
cp /etc/pki/rhui/cdn.redhat.com-chain.crt /<example>/entitlement
----


To manage repositories on your {redhat} client, you need to import the CA and entitlement certificates to the {productname} Server.
This requires that you perform the import procedure three times, to create three entries: one each for the entitlement certificate, the entitlement key, and the {redhat} certificate.



.Procedure: Importing Certificates to the Server

. On the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > GPG and SSL Keys].
. Click btn:[Create Stored Key/Cert] and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate:
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``Entitlement-Cert-Date``.
* In the [guimenu]``Type`` field, select [systemitem]``SSL``.
* In the [guimenu]``Select file to upload`` field, browse to the location where you saved the entitlement certificate, and select the [path]``.crt`` certificate file.
. Click btn:[Create Key].
. Click btn:[Create Stored Key/Cert] and set these parameters for the entitlement key:
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``Entitlement-Key-Date``.
* In the [guimenu]``Type`` field, select [systemitem]``SSL``.
* In the [guimenu]``Select file to upload`` field, browse to the location where you saved the entitlement key, and select the [path]``.key`` key file.
. Click btn:[Create Key].
. Click btn:[Create Stored Key/Cert] and set these parameters for the {redhat} certificate:
* In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, type [systemitem]``redhat-cert``.
* In the [guimenu]``Type`` field, select [systemitem]``SSL``.
* In the [guimenu]``Select file to upload`` field, browse to the location where you saved the {redhat} certificate, and select the certificate file.
. Click btn:[Create Key].



== Prepare Custom Repositories and Channels

To mirror the software from RHUI, you need to create custom channels and repositories in {productname} that are linked to RHUI by a URL.
You must have entitlements to these products in your Red Hat Portal for this to work correctly.
You can use the yum utility to get the URLs of the repositories you want to mirror:

----
yum repolist -v | grep baseurl
----

You can use these repository URLs to create custom repositories.
This allows you to mirror only the content you need to manage your clients.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only create custom versions of {redhat} repositories if you have the correct entitlements in your {redhat} Portal.

|===
| OS Version | Base Product          | Base Channel

|===


include::snippets/manual_channels.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {redhat} 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels.
You will require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you will not be able to create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====


include::snippets/manual_associate.adoc[]



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {redhat} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {redhat} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

Your {susemgr} subscription entitles you to the tools channels for {sleses} (also known as {redhat} Expanded Support or RES).
You must use the client tools channel to create the bootstrap repository.
This procedure applies to both Salt and traditional clients.

[NOTE]

To use RHUI, you need to manually add the required HTTP headers to the configuration file.
Without them, you cannot successfully perform a client synchronization.



.Procedure: Adding HTTP Headers to the Configuration File
. Locate the [systemitem]``X-RHUI-ID`` and [systemitem]``X-RHUI-SIGNATURE`` HTTP headers from your RHUI instance.
    You can use these commands on the {redhat} client to get the values from the cloud instance metadata API at [systemitem]``169.254.169.254``:
+
----
echo "X-RHUI-ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document|base64|tr -d '\n')"
echo "X-RHUI-SIGNATURE=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature|base64|tr -d '\n')"
----
. Open the [path]``/etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf`` configuration file, and add or edit these lines with the correct information:
+
----
[channel_label]
X-RHUI-ID=value
X-RHUI-SIGNATURE=value
----




== Check Synchronization Status

[NOTE]
====
{rhel} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====



ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

include::snippets/trust_gpg.adoc[]

endif::[]



== Register Clients

To register your {redhat} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].


[WARNING]
====
To register and use {rhel}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.
For more information, see ``Registering Older Clients`` at xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].
====



== Package Management and {rhel}{nbsp}8 Clients

If you are using {rhel}{nbsp}8 clients, you cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories like the {rhel} AppStream repository.
You can use the AppStream filter with content lifecycle management to transform modular repositories into regular repositories.

For more information about content lifecycle management, see xref:administration:content-lifecycle.adoc[].
