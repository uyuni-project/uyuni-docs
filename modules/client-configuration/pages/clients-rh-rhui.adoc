= Registering {rhel} Clients with RHUI

// SUSE Liberty Linux not available at Uyuni for now

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
If you are running {rhel} clients directly, rather than using {sleses}, you need to use Red Hat sources to retrieve and update packages.
endif::[]

This section contains information about using {redhat} update infrastructure (RHUI) to register Salt clients running {rhel} operating systems.

If you are running your clients in a public cloud, such as Amazon EC2, use this method.

It is possible to use RHUI in conjunction with the {redhat} content delivery network (CDN) to manage your {rhel} subscriptions.
For information about using {redhat} CDN, see xref:client-configuration:clients-rh-cdn.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====

// SUSE Liberty Linux not available at Uyuni for now

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
{rhel} clients are based on {redhat} and are unrelated to {sleses}, RES, or {sles}.
endif::[]

You are responsible for connecting {productname} Server to the {redhat} update infrastructure.
All clients that get updates using this RHUI certificate need to be correctly licensed, please check with your cloud provider and the {redhat} terms of service for more information.
====

[NOTE]
====
When {rhel} clients registered with RHUI are switched off, {redhat} might declare the certificate invalid.
In this case, you need to turn the client on again, or get a new RHUI certificate.
====



== Import Entitlements and Certificates

In the past it was required to import the certificates and entitlement data manual into {productname} Server.
We automated this task now by using the same mechanism as for SUSE {payg} instances. See also xref:installation-and-upgrade:connect-payg.adoc[].

This guide covers clients registered to {redhat} update infrastructure (RHUI).
You must have at least one system registered to RHUI, with an authorized subscription for repository content.

For information about using {redhat} content delivery network (CDN) instead, see xref:client-configuration:clients-rh-cdn.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
Satellite certificates for client systems require a Satellite server and subscription.
Clients using Satellite certificates are not supported with {productname} Server.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
The PAYG connection regular checks with the client to get the latest authentication data.
It is important that the client stays running and is regular updated.
If this does not happen, repository synchronization will fail with authentication errors at some point in time.
====


[NOTE]
====
Update any {redhat} 7 instance before connecting it.
====


// mc: this depends on the version of Jsch we use. The current version 0.1.55 only support rsa-ssh auth
//     which is forbidden with the DEFAULT policy. If we decide to switch to a different implementation
//     of Jsch (0.2.9 or higher) this limitation is gone and the note can be removed
[NOTE]
====
A {redhat} 9 instance needs to be configured with the crypto policy [literal]``LEGACY`` to be able to connect it.
Execute [command]``sudo update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY`` to configure it accordingly.
====


== Connecting to {redhat} update infrastructure

[[proc-connecting-new-rhui]]
.Procedure: Connecting new {redhat} instance
[role=procedure]
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > {payg}], and click btn:[Add {payg}].
. Start with the page section [guimenu]``{payg} connection Description``.
. In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, add the description.
. Move to the page section [guimenu]``Instance SSH connection data``.
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, enter the instance DNS or IP address to connect from {productname}.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, enter the port number or use default value 22.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, enter the username as specified in the cloud.
. In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, enter the password.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key`` field, enter the instance key.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key Passphrase`` field, enter the key passphrase.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Authentication keys must always be in PEM format.
====

If you are not connecting directly to the instance, but via SSH bastion, proceed with <<proc-adding-ssh-bastion-connection-data>>.

Otherwise, continue with <<proc-finishing-rhui-connecting>>.

[[proc-adding-ssh-bastion-connection-data]]
.Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data
[role=procedure]
. Navigate to the page section [guimenu]``Bastion SSH connection data``.
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, enter the bastion hostname.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, enter the bastion port number.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, enter the bastion username.
. In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, enter the bastion password.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key`` field, enter the bastion key.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key Passphrase`` field, enter the bastion key passphrase.

Complete the setup with <<proc-finishing-rhui-connecting>>.

[[proc-finishing-rhui-connecting]]
.Procedure: Finishing {redhat} connecting
[role=procedure]
. To complete adding new {redhat} connection data, click btn:[Create].
. Return to {payg} connection data [guimenu]``Details`` page.
    The updated connection status is displayed on the top section named [guimenu]``Information``.
. Connection status is shown in [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go`` screen, too.
. If the authentication data for the instance is correct, the column [guimenu]``Status`` shows [literal]``Credentials successfully updated.``

[IMPORTANT]
====
If invalid data is entered at any point, the newly created instance is shown in [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > {payg}``, with column [guimenu]``Status`` displaying an error message.
====


As soon as the authentication data is available on the server, repositories were added for all available repositories on the connected instance.
The repositories can be seen in [guimenu]``Software > Manage > Repositories``

[IMPORTANT]
====
A {redhat} connection will create custom repositories which are owned by organization 1 by default.
If a different organization should own the autogenerated repositories, configure [systemitem]``java.rhui_default_org_id`` in ``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``
====

This only defines and updates the repositories.
If you want to use a repository for a managed client, you need to specify a Software Channel and connect the repositories to it.


== Add Software Channels

// 2022-04-21, ke:
// Section sequence according to https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni-docs/pull/1535

Before you register {redhat} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

include::snippets/arch-other-note.adoc[]

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

Your {susemgr} subscription entitles you to the tools channels for {sleses} (also known as {redhat} Expanded Support or RES).
You must use the client tools channel to create the bootstrap repository.
This procedure applies to Salt clients.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[redhat-rhui-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Red Hat Products - WebUI
|===

// SUSE Liberty Linux not available at Uyuni for now
| OS Version | Product Name
| {redhat} 9 | RHEL and Liberty 9 Base
| {redhat} 8 | RHEL or SLES ES or CentOS 8 Base
| {redhat} 7 | RHEL7 Base x86_64

|===


include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]


endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[redhat-rhui-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.Red Hat Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Tools Channel

| {redhat} 7
| rhel7-pool-uyuni-x86_64
| -
| rhel7-uyuni-client-x86_64

| {redhat} 8
| rhel8-pool-uyuni-x86_64
| -
| rhel8-uyuni-client-x86_64

| {redhat} 9
| rhel9-pool-uyuni-x86_64
| -
| rhel9-uyuni-client-x86_64

|===


include::snippets/addchannels_novendor_cli.adoc[]


[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====

endif::[]


include::snippets/appstream_admon.adoc[]



== Prepare Custom Channels

To mirror the software from RHUI, you need to create custom channels in {productname} that are linked to autogenerated repositories.

The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[redhat-rhui-channels-custom]]

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
.Red Hat Custom Channels
|===

// SUSE Liberty Linux not available at Uyuni for now
| OS Version | Base Product          | Base Channel
| {redhat} 9 | RHEL and Liberty 9 Base | el9-pool-x86_64
| {redhat} 8 | RHEL or SLES ES or CentOS 8 Base | rhel8-pool-x86_64
| {redhat} 7 | RHEL7 Base x86_64 | rhel7-pool-x86_64

|===
endif::[]

// SUSE Liberty Linux not available at Uyuni for now
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Red Hat Custom Channels
|===

| OS Version | Base Channel
| {redhat} 7 | rhel7-pool-uyuni-x86_64
| {redhat} 8 | rhel8-pool-uyuni-x86_64
| {redhat} 9 | rhel9-pool-uyuni-x86_64

|===
endif::[]


include::snippets/manual_channels.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
For {redhat} 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels.
You require packages from both channels.
If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages.
====


include::snippets/manual_associate.adoc[]



== Check Synchronization Status

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_suma.adoc[]


endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]


include::snippets/check_sync_webui_uyuni.adoc[]


endif::[]


include::snippets/check_sync_cli.adoc[]


[NOTE]
====
{rhel} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====


== Manage GPG Keys

Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed.
Only trusted software can be installed on clients.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients.
It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted.
Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key.
====

For more information about GPG keys, see xref:client-configuration:gpg-keys.adoc[].
