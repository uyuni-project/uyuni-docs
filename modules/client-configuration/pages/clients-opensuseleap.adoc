= Registering openSUSE Leap Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running openSUSE operating systems.
{productname} supports openSUSE Leap 15 clients using Salt.
Traditional clients are not supported.

Bootstrapping is supported for starting openSUSE clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {opensuse} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The architectures currently supported are: `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
For full list of supported products and architectures, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].

include::snippets/arch-other-note.adoc[]

//The products you need for this procedure are:
For example, when working with `x86_64` architecture, you need this product:

{opensuse} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.

== Register Clients

To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
