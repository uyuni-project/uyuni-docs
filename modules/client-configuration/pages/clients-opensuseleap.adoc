= Registering openSUSE Leap Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running openSUSE operating systems.
{productname} supports openSUSE Leap 15 clients using Salt.
Traditional clients are not supported.

Bootstrapping is supported for starting openSUSE clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {opensuse} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The architectures currently supported are: `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
For full list of supported products and architectures, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].

//The products you need for this procedure are:
For example, when working with `x86_64` architecture, you need this product:

[IMPORTANT]
====
{opensuse} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====


== Manage GPG Keys

Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed.
Only trusted software can be installed on clients.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients.
It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted.
Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key.
====
