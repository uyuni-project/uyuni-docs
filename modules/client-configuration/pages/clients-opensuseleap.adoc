= Registering {leap} Clients
:revdate: 2025-02-06
:page-revdate: {revdate}

This section contains information about registering clients running {leap} operating systems.
{productname} supports {leap} 15 and {leap} 16 clients using {salt}.

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {leap} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.



== Add Software Channels


Before you register {leap} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The architectures currently supported are:

* {leap} 15: `x86_64` and `aarch64`.
* {leap} 16: `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `ppc64le` and `s390x`

For full list of supported products and architectures, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[].

For example, when working with `x86_64` architecture, you need this product:

.{leap} Products - WebUI

| OS Version
| Product Name

| {leap} 16.0
| {leap} 16.0 x86_64

| {leap} 15.6
| {leap} 15.6 x86_64

| {leap} 15.5
| {leap} 15.5 x86_64

| {leap} 15.4
| {leap} 15.4 x86_64

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

| {leap} 15.6 | opensuse-leap-15.6-pool
| {leap} 15.5 | opensuse-leap-15.5-pool
| {leap} 15.4 | opensuse-leap-15.4-pool

[IMPORTANT]
====
{leap} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====


== Manage GPG Keys

Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed.
Only trusted software can be installed on clients.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients.
It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted.
Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key.
====

For more information about GPG keys, see xref:client-configuration:gpg-keys.adoc[].
