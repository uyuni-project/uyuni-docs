= Client Management Methods

There are a number of ways that the {productname} Server can communicate with clients.
Which one you use depends on the type of client, and your network architecture:

Salt::
is the default choice and recommended unless there are specific needs.
For more information, see xref:contact-methods-salt.adoc[].
Salt SSH::
is useful only if network restrictions make it impossible for clients to establish contact to the server.
This contact method has serious limitations.
For more information, see xref:contact-methods-saltssh.adoc[].
