= Client Contact Methods

There are three contact methods how the {productname} Server can communicate with clients.
They are based on {salt} protocols.

Which {salt} contact method you use depends on the type of client, and your network architecture:

Default (Salt)::
is the default choice and is recommended unless there are specific needs.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-default.adoc[].

SSH Push::
is useful only if network restrictions make it impossible for clients to establish contact to the server.
It is supported with the {salt} Bundle only.
This contact method has serious limitations.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltssh.adoc[].
SSH Push (with tunnel)::
is the same as SSH Push, but with using a secured communication tunnel.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltssh-tunnel.adoc[].


Implementation of {salt} communication software options:

Salt Bundle::
is a single binary package containing {salt} Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries.
Thus the {salt} contact method is independent from software installed on the client.
Using the {salt} Bundle is the default.
It is the only supported implementation for the SSH Push or SSH Push (with tunnel) contact method.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltbundle.adoc[].
Salt Minion::
is {salt} software installed on the client system.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The so-called traditional contact protocol is no longer supported with {productname} 5.0 and later.
Before upgrading from {productname} 4 to 5, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to {salt} or replaced with {salt} proxies.

For more information about migrating traditional {productname} 4 clients to {salt} clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html
