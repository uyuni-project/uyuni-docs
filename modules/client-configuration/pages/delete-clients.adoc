[[delete.clients]]
= Client Deletion

// FIXME: where do we need to add warnings (suse clients only, all clients)

If you need to remove a client from your {productname} Server, you can use the {webui} to delete it.
You can also remove a client from the command line.
These procedures work for both traditional and Salt clients.

// can also be done manually.
// FIXME: Why Manual Cleanup is necessary sometimes.



[[delete.clients.webui]]
== Delete a Client with the {webui}

.Procedure: Deleting a Client
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and select the client to delete.
. Click btn:[Delete System].
. Check the details and click btn:[Delete Profile] to confirm.
. For Salt clients, {productname} attempts to clean up additional configuration.
  If the client cannot be contacted, you are given the option to cancel the deletion, or delete the client without cleaning up the configuration files.


You can also delete multiple clients using the system set manager.
For more information about the system set manager, see xref:client-configuration:system-set-manager.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not possible to automatically clean up a traditional client after deleting it.
You have to take care of this yourself.
Furthermore, cleaning up a Salt client does not remove Salt itself.
====

[NOTE]
====
Normally you migrate a traditional client to a Salt client without deleting the client.
Salt automatically detects that you have a traditional client and does the necessary changes itself.
But if you already deleted the traditional client and want to register it as a Salt client again, see
xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-register-trad-as-salt-after-deletion.adoc[].

== Delete a Salt Client on the Command Line (with API Call)

.Procedure: Deleting a Client from the Server

. Delete the client with the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name):
+
----
spacecmd system_delete FQDN
----
+
[command]``spacecmd system_delete`` also deletes the Salt key.

Sometimes a new registration of a deleted (unregistered) client might not be possible.
To solve this issue, some Salt cache files should be deleted on the {productname} Server (Salt master) before trying to re-register again:

----
rm /var/cache/salt/master/thin/version
rm /var/cache/salt/master/thin/thin.tgz
----



[[delete.clients.commandline]]
== Delete a Client from the Command Line


=== Salt Client

// Manual Registration Cleanup

This process is only for {productname} clients, do not run it on the {productname} Server itself.

[NOTE]
====
You must not execute the following procedure on clients running {rhel} and clones.
====

.Procedure: Deleting SLES 12 and 15 Salt Clients

. Stop the salt-minion service:
+
----
systemctl stop salt-minion
----
+
////
SLES 11:
+
----
rcsalt stop
----
////

. Remove the repositories and configuration files:
+
----
rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager\:channels.repo
rm -r /etc/sysconfig/rhn/
rm -r /etc/salt/
----

. Remove Client Packages:
+
----
zypper rm -u salt salt-minion python*-salt sle-manager-tools-release
----


.Procedure: Salt Bundle Client - Manual Registration Cleanup

. To unregister, run:
+
----
systemctl stop venv-salt-minion
zypper rm -y venv-salt-minion
rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager\:channels.repo /etc/venv-salt-minion/*
rm -r /etc/venv-salt-minion/*
----

For information about the Salt bundle, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltbundle.adoc[].



This process is only for {productname} clients, do not run it on the {productname} Server itself.

[NOTE]
====
You must not execute the following procedure on clients running {rhel} and clones.

.Procedure: Traditional SLES 12 and 15 Clients - Manual Cleanup

. Stop the osad service (if it is in use):
+
----
systemctl stop osad
----

// SLES 11:
//    rcosad stop

. On a SLES 12 client remove the following  packages if installed.
This should be tried first (in case the [package]``osad`` package is not installed, do not list it on the command line):
+
----
zypper rm -u spacewalksd spacewalk-check zypp-plugin-spacewalk \
spacewalk-client-tools osad python2-zypp-plugin-spacewalk \
python2-spacewalk-check python2-spacewalk-client-setup
----

. On a SLES 15 client remove the following packages if installed:
+
----
zypper rm -u spacewalk-client-setup mgr-daemon spacewalk-check \
zypp-plugin-spacewalk mgr-osad python3-zypp-plugin-spacewalk \
python3-spacewalk-check python3-spacewalk-client-setup
----

. You will see the following output:
+
----
Refreshing service 'spacewalk'. 
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...
 
The following packages are going to be REMOVED:
  spacewalk-check spacewalk-client-setup spacewalksd zypp
plugin-python osad
 
5 packages to remove.
After the operation, 301.0 KiB will be freed.
Continue? [y/n/?] (y):
----
+
The above RPM packages are client specific, and should be removed.
If this fails, they should be manually removed.
The [command]``rpm -e`` command should not be used unless the [command]``zypper rm`` command above failed.

. After this is complete, the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid file should be removed.
  This file only exists on a client machine and is used to register itself with SUSE Manager:
+
----
rm /etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid
----

. Any configured spacewalk channels should be deleted with:
+
----
rm /etc/zypp/repos.d/spacewalk*
----

. Finally verify that repositories are properly configured.
  Refresh them on the server and then list them:
+
----
zypper ref -s
zypper lr
----

If any repositories pointing to spacewalk still exist, remove them with:

----
zypper repos -d
zypper removerepo <ID of the repo in the output from previous command>
----
