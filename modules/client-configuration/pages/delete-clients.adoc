= Delete Clients

If you need to remove a client from your {productname} Server, you can use the {webui} to delete it.
This procedure works for both traditional and Salt clients.



.Procedure: Deleting a Client
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and select the client to delete.
. Click btn:[Delete System].
. Check the details and click btn:[Delete Profile] to confirm.
. For Salt clients, {productname} attempts to clean up additional configuration.
  If the client cannot be contacted, you are given the option to cancel the deletion, or delete the client without cleaning up the configuration files.


You can also delete multiple clients using the system set manager.
For more information about the system set manager, see xref:client-configuration:system-set-manager.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not possible to automatically clean up a traditional client after deleting it.
You have to take care of this yourself.
Furthermore, cleaning up a Salt client does only disable salt and stop the service if possible. It does not uninstall the package.
