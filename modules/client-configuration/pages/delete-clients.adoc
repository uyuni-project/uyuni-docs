[[delete.clients]]
= Client Deletion

// FIXME: where do we need to add warnings (suse clients only, all clients)

If you need to remove a client from your {productname} Server, you can:

* use the {webui} to delete it
* remove a client from the command line.

// can also be done manually.
// FIXME: Why Manual Cleanup is necessary sometimes.



[[delete.clients.webui]]
== Delete a Client with the {webui}

.Procedure: Deleting a Client
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[SystemÂ List] and select the client to delete.
. Click btn:[Delete System].
. Check the details and click btn:[Delete Profile] to confirm.
. For Salt clients, {productname} attempts to clean up additional configuration.
  If the client cannot be contacted, you are given the option to cancel the deletion, or delete the client without cleaning up the configuration files.

You can also delete multiple clients using the System Set Manager.
For more information about the System Set Manager, see xref:client-configuration:system-set-manager.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Cleaning up a client only disables {salt} and stops the service if possible.
It does not uninstall the package.
====



== Delete a Client on the Command Line (with API Call)

.Procedure: Deleting a Client from the Server
. Delete the client with the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name):
+
----
spacecmd system_delete FQDN
----
+
[command]``spacecmd system_delete`` also deletes the {salt} key.

[command]``system_delete`` offers the following options:

----
usage: system_delete [options] <SYSTEMS>

    options:
          -c TYPE - Possible values:
             *  'FAIL_ON_CLEANUP_ERR' - fail in case of cleanup error,
             *  'NO_CLEANUP' - do not cleanup, just delete,
             *  'FORCE_DELETE' - try cleanup first but delete server anyway
	        in case of error

////
// move to Trouble Shooting and link from here
Sometimes a new registration of a deleted (unregistered) client might not be possible.
To solve this issue, some Salt cache files should be deleted on the {productname} Server (Salt master) before trying to re-register again:

----
rm /var/cache/salt/master/thin/version
rm /var/cache/salt/master/thin/thin.tgz
----
////



[[delete.clients.commandline]]
== Delete a Client from the Command Line

//=== Salt Client

// Manual Registration Cleanup

[IMPORTANT]
====
This process is for {productname} clients only.
Do not run it on the {productname} Server itself.
====

[WARNING]
====
You must not execute the following procedure on clients running {rhel}, {debian}, or clones.
Instead of [command]``zypper`` use equivalent packager commands such as [command]``yum``, [command]``dnf``, or [command]``apt``.
