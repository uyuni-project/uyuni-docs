= Registering openSUSE Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running openSUSE operating systems.
{productname} supports openSUSE Leap 15 clients using Salt.
Traditional clients are not supported.

Bootstrapping is supported for starting openSUSE clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {opensuse} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {opensuse} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

The products you need for this procedure are:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[[opensuse-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.OpenSUSE Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version
| Product Name

| {opensuse} Leap 15.2
| openSUSE Leap 15.2 x86_64

| {opensuse} Leap 15.3
| openSUSE Leap 15.3 x86_64

|===

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

|===
| OS Version | Base Channel
| {opensuse} Leap 15.2 | opensuse-leap-15.2-pool

== Register Clients

To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
