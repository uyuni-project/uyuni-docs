= Registering openSUSE Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running openSUSE operating systems.
{productname} supports openSUSE Leap 15 clients using Salt.
Traditional clients are not supported.

Bootstrapping is supported for starting openSUSE clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {opensuse} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

The products you need for this procedure are:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[[opensuse-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.OpenSUSE Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version
| Product Name

| {opensuse} Leap 15.1
| openSUSE Leap 15.1 x86_64

| {opensuse} Leap 15.2
| openSUSE Leap 15.2 x86_64

| {opensuse} Leap 15.3
| openSUSE Leap 15.3 x86_64

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.

== Register Clients

To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
