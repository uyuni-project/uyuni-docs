= Registering with a Bootstrap Script (Salt and Traditional)


You can register Salt or traditional clients through the {productname} Proxy with a bootstrap script.
This is done almost the same way as registering clients directly with the {productname} Server.
The difference is that you create the bootstrap script on the {productname} Proxy with a command line tool.
The bootstrap script then deploys all necessary information to the clients.
The bootstrap script requires some parameters such as activation keys or GPG keys.
These parameters depend on your specific setup.



.Procedure: Registering Clients to a Proxy with a Bootstrap Script

. Create a client activation key on the {productname} server using the {webui}.
    For more information, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
. On the proxy, execute the [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` command line tool as {rootuser}.
    If needed, use the additional command line switches to tune your bootstrap script.
    To install a traditional client instead of a Salt client, ensure you use the [command]``--traditional`` switch.
+
To view available options type [command]``mgr-bootstrap --help`` from the command line:
+
----
mgr-bootstrap --activation-keys=key-string
----
+
. OPTIONAL: Edit the resulting bootstrap script.
. Execute the bootstrap script directly on the clients or from the proxy with [command]``ssh``.
  Replace [systemitem]``<bootstrap>`` with the name of the bootstrap script and [systemitem]`` <client.example.com>`` with the host name of your client:
+
----
cat <bootstrap> | ssh root@<client.example.com> /bin/bash
