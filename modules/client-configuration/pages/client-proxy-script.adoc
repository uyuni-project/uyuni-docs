= Register Clients  to a Proxy with a Bootstrap Script


You can register clients through the {productname} Proxy with a bootstrap script.
This is done almost the same way as registering clients directly with the {productname} Server.

You create the bootstrap script on the {productname} Server with a command line tool.
The bootstrap script then deploys all necessary information to the clients.
The bootstrap script requires some parameters such as the FQDN of the proxy, activation keys, or GPG keys.
These parameters depend on your specific setup, but the FQDN of the proxy is mandatory.



.Procedure: Registering Clients to a Proxy with a Bootstrap Script

. Create a client activation key on the {productname} Server using the {webui}.
  For more information, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
. On the container host of the server, start a terminial in the container:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl term
----

+

--
.. In the container, to create the bootstrap script, execute the [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` command:

+

// FIXME or must we set --http-proxy here?

+

[source,shell]
----
mgr-bootstrap --hostname=FQDN --activation-keys=ACTIVATION_KEY
----

+

If needed, use the additional command line switches to tune your bootstrap script.
   To view available options type [command]``mgr-bootstrap --help`` from the command line.

.. OPTIONAL: Edit the resulting bootstrap script.
--

. Execute the bootstrap script.
  There are two options:

+

* Transfer it to the client and run it directly on the clients.

* Execute it from the proxy with [command]``ssh``.
  Replace [systemitem]``<bootstrap>`` with the name of the bootstrap script and [systemitem]`` <client.example.com>`` with the host name of the client:

+

[source,shell]
----
cat <bootstrap> | ssh root@<client.example.com> /bin/bash
----
