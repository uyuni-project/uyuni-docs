= Register Clients  to a Proxy with a Bootstrap Script


You can register clients through the {productname} Proxy with a bootstrap script.
This is done almost the same way as registering clients directly with the {productname} Server.

You create the bootstrap script in the {productname} Server container with the [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` command line tool.
[command]``mgr-bootstrap`` requires some parameters such as the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the proxy, activation keys, or GPG keys.
These parameters depend on your specific setup, but the FQDN of the proxy is mandatory.

The bootstrap script then deploys all necessary information to the clients.



.Procedure: Registering Clients to a Proxy with a Bootstrap Script

. Create a client activation key on the {productname} Server using the {webui}.
  For more information, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
. On the container host of the server, start a terminial in the container:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl term
----

+

--
.. In the container, to create the bootstrap script, execute the [command]``mgr-bootstrap`` command, for example, with these options:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgr-bootstrap --hostname=MLM_PROXY --activation-keys=ACTIVATION_KEY \
  --script bootstrap-MLM_PROXY.sh
----

+

Replace [literal]``MLM_PROXY`` with the host name of your proxy.

+
With the [option]``--script`` option you save the bootstrap script with a descriptive name.
   If needed, use additional command line options to customize your bootstrap script.
   To view available options type [command]``mgr-bootstrap --help`` from the command line.

.. OPTIONAL: Edit the resulting bootstrap script.
--

. Execute the bootstrap script.
  There are two options:

+

* Transfer the script to the client and run it directly on the clients.
  Alternatively, because the proxy forwards requests to the server, the client can download it from http://MLM_PROXY/pub/bootstrap-MLM_PROXY.sh.
  Replace [literal]``MLM_PROXY`` with the host name of your proxy.

* Execute the script from the proxy with [command]``ssh``.
  Replace [literal]``MLM_PROXY`` with the host name of the proxy and [systemitem]`` <client.example.com>`` with the host name of the client:

+

[source,shell]
----
cat /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-MLM_PROXY.sh | ssh root@<client.example.com> /bin/bash
----
