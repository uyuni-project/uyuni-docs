= {almalinux} Client Registration

You can register {almalinux} clients to your {productname} Server.
The method and details vary depending on the operating system of the client.

Before you start, ensure that the client has the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server.

//OM 2021-07-21: This admonition was created using the example of the amazon client, but is not necessary. It appears again on the very next page, making the document look cluttered. It is enough to have it in one place only.
//[WARNING]
//====
//When created at AWS, {almalinux} instances always have the same `machine-id` id at `/etc/machine-id`.
//Make sure you regenerate the `machine-id` after the instance is created.
//For more information, see xref:administration:tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].]

You must also have created an activation key.
For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
