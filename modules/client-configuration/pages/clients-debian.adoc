= Registering {debian} Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {debian} operating systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} does not provide support for {debian} operating systems.
{productname} allows you to manage {debian} clients, but support is not provided.
Using {productname} to manage {debian} clients is experimental.
These instructions have been tested on {debian}{nbsp}9 Stretch and {debian}{nbsp}10 Buster.
Do not rely on {debian} clients in a production environment.
====

Bootstrapping can be used with {debian} clients for performing initial state runs, and for profile updates.



== Prepare to Register

Some preparation is required before you can register {debian} clients to the {productname} Server.

If you are using Debian{nbsp}9, install the ``apt-transport-https`` package on the client before you attempt to register.
On the client, at the command prompt, as root, run:

----
apt install apt-transport-https
----

Ensure DNS is correctly configured and provides an entry for the client.
Alternatively, you can configure the ``/etc/hosts`` files on both the {productname} Server and the client with the appropriate entries.

The client must have the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} server before registration.

The {productname} Server requires the ``spacewalk-utils`` package.
On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, run:

----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----



.Procedure: Adding the {debian} Channels
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
+
----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----
. Add the {debian} channels.
For {debian}{nbsp}9:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-pool-amd64-uyuni
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-amd64-main-security-uyuni
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-amd64-main-updates-uyuni
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-amd64-uyuni-client
----
For {debian}{nbsp}10:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-pool-amd64-uyuni
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-amd64-main-security-uyuni
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-amd64-main-updates-uyuni
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-amd64-uyuni-client
----



.Procedure: Synchronizing {centos} repositories

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage], and check every {debian} channel.
. In the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` subtab, and click btn:[Sync Now].
You can also create a regular synchronization schedule on this page.


[NOTE]
====
{debian} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====


There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``Products`` tab.
+
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], then click the channel associated to the repository.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, then click [guimenu]``Sync`` and check [systemitem]``Sync Status``.
endif::[]
* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt:
+
----
tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log
----
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.
You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.



== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

By default, {debian} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {debian} client tools.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.
However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

To fix this, add the key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all {debian} bootstrap scripts:
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----

You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are bootstrapping clients using the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key.
Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.

I feel like this is probably not required, as it doesn't really have any instructions in it? --LKB 2020-03-05

== Create Content Lifecycle Channels

Clone the channels as per your servers lifecycle policy (e.g. dev, test, prod) or alternatively use the new amazing "Content Lifecycle" functionality to simplify the channels management tasks'

From the command line, as an alternative, you can use respectively `spacecmd softwarechannel_clone` or `spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle`.

In the below example we have created 2 environemnts using the Content Lifecycle section: `DEV, TEST-QA`.

For more details about how to create Content Lifecycle channels and how to apply filters have a look at the related section of the documentation:

https://www.uyuni-project.org/uyuni-docs/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html



== Create an activation key for the debian servers

Under Systems --> Activation keys create an activation key for the lifecycle environment your debian servers need to be assigned to.

As shown in the picture, we have created an activation key called qa-test-debian10 and assigned all of the debian qa-test lifecycle channels to it.

== Register Clients

To register your {debian} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are regenerated daily.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For {debian}{nbsp}10, select ``debian10-amd64-uyuni`` when prompted.


////
I'm not sure we need this either, it's pretty generic bootstrapping info, which we cover elsewhere. --LKB 2020-03-05

==== Bootstrapping from the Uyuni UI

Browse through Systems --> Boostrapping --> Bootstrap Minions and insert the appropriate values.

*Host:* debian client hostname/FQDN

*SSH Port:* ssh port the client listens on

*Username:* root

*password:* root password

*activation key:* activation key created before related to lifecycle the debian client will be registered against

Make also sure "Disable SSH strict host key checking..." is thicked to disable fingerprint confirmation so it will not complain during the first run.

==== Bootstrapping the client using the bootstrip script


Generate a new bootstrap script from the UI browsing Admin --> Manager Configuration --> Bootstrap script
Fill up the fields inserting the correct values and click on the update button.

image::7-uyuni-bootstrap-script.png[scaledwidth=80%]

A `bootstrap.sh` script will be generated in `/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap`, edit the script so that the activation key and the uyuni Hostname/FQDN match.

----
ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-qa-test-debian10

HOSTNAME=uyuni4-osuse.home-lab.net
----

The script can either be run from the uyuni server itself:
----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap
cat bootstrap.sh | ssh root@192.168.122.185
----
or copied over to the client with scp command and executed later on.

In case the script has been run from the debian client the salt key must be accepted manually this can be done from the command line running the followng command:
----
salt-key -a <client name>
----
or from the UI under Salt--> Salt keys
