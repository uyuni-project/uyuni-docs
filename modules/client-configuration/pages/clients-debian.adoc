= Registering {debian} Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {debian} operating systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} does not provide support for {debian} operating systems.
{productname} allows you to manage {debian} clients, but support is not provided.
Using {productname} to manage {debian} clients is experimental.
These instructions have been tested on {debian}{nbsp}9 Stretch and {debian}{nbsp}10 Buster.
Do not rely on {debian} clients in a production environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
{debian} is supported for Salt clients only.
Traditional clients are not supported.
====

Bootstrapping can be used with {debian} clients for performing initial state runs, and for profile updates.



== Prepare to Register

Some preparation is required before you can register {debian} clients to the {productname} Server:

* If you are using Debian{nbsp}9, install the ``apt-transport-https`` package on the client before you attempt to register.
    On the client, at the command prompt, as root, run:
+
----
apt install apt-transport-https
----

* Ensure DNS is correctly configured and provides an entry for the client.
    Alternatively, you can configure the ``/etc/hosts`` files on both the {productname} Server and the client with the appropriate entries.
* The client must have the date and time synchronized correctly with the {productname} Server before registration.



== Add Software Channels

The channels you need for this procedure are:

== Register Clients

To register your {debian} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are regenerated daily.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For {debian}{nbsp}10, select ``debian10-amd64-uyuni`` when prompted.


For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
