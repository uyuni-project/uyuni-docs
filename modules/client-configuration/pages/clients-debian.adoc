= Registering {debian} Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {debian} operating systems.

{productname} supports for {debian} 9 Stretch and 10 Buster clients is experimental.

Bootstrapping is supported for starting {debian} clients and performing initial state runs such as setting repositories and performing profile updates.

== Prepare to Register

Some preparation is required before you can register {debian} clients to the {productname} Server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Debian 9 requires `apt-transport-https` before the registration. Make sure it is installed on the client otherwise registration will fail:

----
apt install apt-transport-https
----

Ensure DNS is correctly configured and provides an entry for the client, otherwise configure the `/etc/hosts` files on both the uyuni server and the client with the appropriate entries.

The client has to have NTP synchronised correctly with the Uyuni server before the registration
====


At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``spacewalk-utils`` package:

----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----

=== Create and sync the debian channels on Uyuni

For {debian} 9:

----
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-pool-amd64
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-amd64-main-security
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-amd64-main-updates
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-9-amd64-uyuni-client-master
----
----
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-9-pool-amd64 &
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-9-amd64-main-security &
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-9-amd64-main-updates &
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-9-amd64-uyuni-client-master &
----

For {debian} 10:

----
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-pool-amd64
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-amd64-main-security
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-amd64-main-updates
spacewalk-common-channels -u admin -a amd64-deb debian-10-amd64-uyuni-client-master
----
----
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-10-pool-amd64 &
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-10-amd64-main-security &
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-10-amd64-main-updates &
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel debian-10-amd64-uyuni-client-master &
----

[NOTE]
====
{debian} channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.

Alternatevely You can use `debian-x-amd64-uyuni-client-stable` if you are using Uyuni stable version

.Procedure: Alternative Method for Adding {debian} Channels and Repositories (Unsupported)
.  
[WARNING]
====
The ``spacewalk-utils`` package is not supported by {suse}, including the ``spacewalk-common-channels`` tool.
You will not be supported if your system becomes inoperable by using these tools.
====

. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----
. Add the {debian} channels.

When you have the channels set up, you can also start the syncronization manually or automatically.

To manually synchronize the channels, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].
Click each channel in the list, and:

. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab.
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` subtab.
. Click btn:[Sync Now] to begin synchronization immediately.
. You can also create a synchronization schedule from this screen.

endif::[]

.Procedure: Adding the {debian} Channels

. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``spacewalk-utils`` package:

----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----

. Add the {debian} channels.

. Synchronize the new custom channels.

endif::[]

When you have the channels set up, you can also start the syncronization manually or automatically.

To do this, proceed to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], and for each channel you created, click on it and:

. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories``
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync``and click btn:[Sync Now] to begin synchronization immediately.
. You can also setup a scheduled syncronization from this screen.

== Monitor Synchronization Progress

There are two ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
+
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
* In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], then click on the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories``, then [guimenu]``Sync`` and check [systemitem]``Sync Status``
endif::[]
* Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt with [command]``tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/channel-label.log``.
+
Each child channel will generate its own log during the synchronization progress.

You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete.

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

By default, {debian} does not trust the GPG key for {productname} {debian} client tools.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted.

However, they will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them.

To fix this, add this key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter in all {debian} bootstrap scripts:
----
uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key
----

You do not need to delete any previously stored keys.

If you are boostrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a salt state to trust the key.
Create the salt state and assign it to the organization.
You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients.
endif::[]


== Clone or create Content lifecycle channels for the debian servers

Clone the channels as per your servers lifecycle policy (e.g. dev, test, prod) or alternatevely use the new amazing "Content Lifecycle" functionality to simplify the channels management tasks'

From the command line, as an alternative, you can use respectively `spacecmd softwarechannel_clone` or `spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle`.

In the below example we have created 2 environemnts using the Content Lifecycle section: `DEV, TEST-QA`.

For more details about how to create Content Lifecycle channels and how to apply filters have a look at the related section of the documentation:

https://www.uyuni-project.org/uyuni-docs/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html

== Create an activation key for the debian servers

Under Systems --> Activation keys create an activation key for the lifecycle environment your debian servers need to be assigned to.

As shown in the picture, we have created an activation key called qa-test-debian10 and assigned all of the debian qa-test lifecycle channels to it.

== Register Clients

=== Create a bootstrap repository for debian

From the uyuni command line run:

. To register your {debian} clients, you will need a bootstrap repository.
Create the bootstrap repository at the command prompt, with this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels

And select debian10-amd64-uyuni in case of debian 10:
1. SLE-12-SP4-x86_64
2. debian10-amd64-uyuni

Enter a number of a product label: 2
----

The necessary packages will be copied in the `/srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/debian/` directory and served by uyuni as well.

=== Bootstrap the debian client

==== Bootstrapping from the Uyuni UI

Browse through Systems --> Boostrapping --> Bootstrap Minions and insert the appropriate values.

*Host:* debian client hostname/FQDN

*SSH Port:* ssh port the client listens on

*Username:* root

*password:* root password

*activation key:* activation key created before related to lifecycle the debian client will be registered against

Make also sure "Disable SSH strict host key checking..." is thicked to disable fingerprint confirmation so it will not complain during the first run.

image::6-uyuni-ui-bootstrap-debian.png[scaledwidth=80%]

==== Bootstrapping the client using the bootstrip script


Generate a new bootstrap script from the UI browsing Admin --> Manager Configuration --> Bootstrap script
Fill up the fields inserting the correct values and click on the update button.

image::7-uyuni-bootstrap-script.png[scaledwidth=80%]

A `bootstrap.sh` script will be generated in `/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap`, edit the script so that the activation key and the uyuni Hostname/FQDN match.

----
ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-qa-test-debian10

HOSTNAME=uyuni4-osuse.home-lab.net
----

The script can either be run from the uyuni server itself:
----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap
cat bootstrap.sh | ssh root@192.168.122.185
----
or copied over to the client with scp command and executed later on.

In case the script has been run from the debian client the salt key must be accepted manually this can be done from the command line running the followng command:
----
salt-key -a <client name>
----
or from the UI under Salt--> Salt keys
