= Registering {debian} Clients

This section contains information about registering Salt clients running {debian} operating systems.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{suse} does not provide support for {debian} operating systems.
{productname} allows you to manage {debian} clients, but support is not provided.
Using {productname} to manage {debian} clients is experimental.
These instructions have been tested on {debian}{nbsp}10 and {debian}{nbsp}11.
Do not rely on {debian} clients in a production environment.
====

[NOTE]
====
{debian} is supported for Salt clients only.
Traditional clients are not supported.
====

Bootstrapping can be used with {debian} clients for performing initial state runs, and for profile updates.



== Prepare to Register

* Ensure DNS is correctly configured and provides an entry for the client.
  Alternatively, you can configure the ``/etc/hosts`` files on both the {productname} Server and the client with the appropriate entries.
* The client must have the date and time synchronized with the {productname} Server before registration.



== Add Software Channels

Before you can register {debian} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[debian-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Debian Products - WebUI
|===
| OS Version  | Product Name
| {debian} 10 | Debian 10
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[debian-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Debian Channels - CLI
|===
| OS Version  | Product Name
| {debian} 10 | debian-10-pool-amd64
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_cli.adoc[]

endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[debian-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.Debian Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Updates Channel
| Security Channel

| {debian} 10
| debian-10-pool-amd64-uyuni
| debian-10-amd64-uyuni-client
| debian-10-amd64-main-updates-uyuni
| debian-10-amd64-main-security-uyuni


|===

include::snippets/addchannels_novendor_cli.adoc[]

endif::[]



== Check Synchronization Status

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_uyuni.adoc[]

endif::[]

include::snippets/check_sync_cli.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
{debian} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

include::snippets/trust_gpg.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
{debian} clients can require multiple GPG keys to be installed.
====

endif::[]

When synchronizing third-party {debian} repositories, you will need to import the appropriate GPG key on the server.
If the GPG key is missing, synchronization will fail.

For {debian} repositories, only the metadata is signed. Therefore importing a GPG key for the software channel is not needed.
Packages will not be re-signed by Uyuni.

To see which GPG keys are already imported to {productname} Server, run the following command:

----
sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys
----

To import a new GPG key, use the `--import` parameter:

----
sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --import <filename>.gpg
----


== Root Access

The root user on {debian} is disabled by default for SSH access.

To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file.

.Procedure: Granting Root User Access

. On the client, edit the [filename]``sudoers`` file:
+
----
sudo visudo
----
+
Grant [command]``sudo`` access to the user by adding this line at the end of the [filename]``sudoers`` file.
Replace [systemitem]``<user>`` with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the {webui}:
+
----
<user>  ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python
----

[NOTE]
====
This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client.
When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required.
We recommend that you remove the line from the [path]``sudoers`` file after the client has been successfully installed.
====



== Register Clients

To register your {debian} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are regenerated daily.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----

For {debian}{nbsp}10, select ``debian10-amd64-uyuni`` when prompted.


For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
