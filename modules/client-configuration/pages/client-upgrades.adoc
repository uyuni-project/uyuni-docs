= Client Upgrades

Clients use the versioning system of their underlying operating system, and require regular upgrades.
For clients using {suse} operating systems, you can perform upgrades within the {productname} {webui}.
For supported {sle}{nbsp}15 upgrade paths, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html


To upgrade clients running SLE{nbsp}12 to SLE{nbsp}15, the upgrade is automated, but you will need to do some preparation steps before you begin.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:client-upgrades-major.adoc[].

You can also automate client upgrades using the content lifecycle manager.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:client-upgrades-lifecycle.adoc[].
