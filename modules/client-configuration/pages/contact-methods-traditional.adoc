= Contact Methods for Traditional Clients

Traditional clients can communicate with the {productname} Server using a range of methods.

The {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) runs on traditional client systems and periodically connects with {productname} to check for new updates and notifications.

Push via SSH is used in environments where clients cannot reach the {productname} Server directly.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the {productname} Server.

OSAD is an alternative contact method between {productname} and its clients, which allows registered clients to execute scheduled actions immediately. 
OSAD is typically used in conjunction with rhnsd.
