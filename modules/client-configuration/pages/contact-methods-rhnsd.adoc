= SUSE Manager Daemon (rhnsd)


The {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) runs on traditional client systems and periodically connects with {productname} to check for new updates and notifications.
It does not apply to Salt clients.



== Start rhnsd ==

A systemd timer ([systemitem]``rhnsd.timer``) is used and controlled by [systemitem]``rhnsd.service``.

By default, [systemitem]``rhnsd`` checks every four hours for new actions.
This means it can take some time for clients to execute scheduled actions.

To check for updates, [systemitem]``rhnsd`` runs the external [systemitem]``mgr_check`` program located in [path]``/usr/sbin/``.
This is a small application that establishes the network connection to {productname}.
The {productname} daemon does not listen on any network ports or talk to the network directly.
All network activity is performed by the [systemitem]``mgr_check`` utility.

This figure provides an overview of the default [systemitem]``rhnsd`` process path.
All items left of the [systemitem]``Python XMLRPC server`` block represent processes running on the {productname} client.

== Configure rhnsd

On {sle}{nbsp}12 and later, the default time interval is set in [path]``/etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/rhnsd.timer``, in this section:

----
[Timer]
OnCalendar=00/4:00
RandomizedDelaySec=30min
----

You can create an overriding drop-in file for [path]``rhnsd.timer`` using [command]``systemctl``:

----
systemctl edit rhnsd.timer
----

For example, if you want configure a two hour time interval:

----
[Timer]
OnCalendar=00/2:00
----

The file is saved as [path]``/etc/systemd/system/rhnsd.timer.d/override.conf``.

For more information about systemd timers, see the [command]``systemd.timer`` and [command]``systemctl`` manpages.
