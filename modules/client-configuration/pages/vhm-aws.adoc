You can use a virtual host manager (VHM) to gather instances from Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The VHM allows {productname} to obtain and report information about your clusters.
For more information on VHMs, see xref:client-configuration:vhm.adoc[].



== Create an AmazonÂ EC2 VHM


The Virtual Host Manager (VHM) runs on the {productname} Server.

Ensure you have installed the [systemitem]``virtual-host-gatherer-libcloud`` package on the {productname} Server.


.Procedure: Creating an Amazon EC2 VHM

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers].
. Click btn:[Create] and select [guimenu]``Amazon EC2`` from the drop-down menu.
. In the [guimenu]``Add an Amazon EC2 Virtual Host Manager`` section, use these parameters:
* In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, type a custom name for your VHM.
* In the [guimenu]``Access Key ID`` field, type the access key ID provided by Amazon.
* In the [guimenu]``Secret Access Key`` field, type the secret access key associated with the Amazon instance.
* In the [guimenu]``Region`` field, type the region to use.
* In the [guimenu]``Zone`` field, type the zone your VM is located in.
  This is required for subscription matching to work.
  For more information about setting regions and zones, see xref:client-configuration:virtualization.adoc#_susesupport_and_vm_zones[].
. Click btn:[Create] to save your changes and create the VHM.
. On the [guimenu]``Virtual Host Managers`` page, select the new VHM.
. On the [guimenu]``Properties`` page, click btn:[Refresh Data] to inventory the new VHM.

To see which objects and resources have been inventoried, navigate to menu:Systems[System List > Virtual Systems].


Instances running on the Amazon public cloud report a UUID to the {productname} Server in the format of an ``i`` followed by seventeen hexadecimal digits:

----
I1234567890abcdef0
----



== AWS Permissions for Virtual Host Manager

For security reasons, always grant the least privilege possible for a task to be performed.
Using an Access Key with excessive permissions for users connecting to AWS is not advised.

For SUSE Manager to gather the information required from AWS, the VHM needs permission to describe EC2 instances and addresses.
One method to grant this is to create a new IAM user (Identity and Access Management) specific to this task, create a policy as follows and attach to the user:

----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeAddresses",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----


You can limit permissions more by restricting access to specific regions.
