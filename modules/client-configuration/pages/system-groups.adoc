= System Groups

You can use system groups to make it easier to manage a large number of clients.
Groups can be used to perform bulk actions on clients such as applying updates, configuration channels, salt states, or formulas.

You can organize clients into groups in any way that works for your environment.
For example, you could organize clients on which operating system is installed, which physical location they are in, or the type of workload they are handling.
Clients can be in any number of groups, so you can define your groups in different ways.

When you have clients organized into groups, you can perform updates on all clients in one or more groups, or on intersections between groups.
For example, you can define one group for all Salt clients, and another group for all SLES clients.
You can then perform updates on all Salt clients, or use the intersection between the groups, and update all Salt SLES clients.



== Create Groups

You need to create some groups before you can use them to organize your clients.



.Procedure: Creating a New SystemÂ Group
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups].
. Click btn:[Create Group].
. Give your new group a name and a description.
. Click btn:[Create Group] to save your group.
. Repeat for each group you require.



== Add Clients to Groups

You can add individual clients to your groups, or add multiple clients at the same time.



.Procedure: Adding A Single Client to a Group
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and click the name of the client to add.
. Navigate to the menu:Groups[Join] tab.
. Check the group to join and click btn:[Join Selected Groups].



.Procedure: Adding Multiple Clients to a Group
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and click the name of the group to add clients to.
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Target systems`` tab.
. Check the clients to add and click btn:[Add Systems].



.Procedure: Adding Multiple Clients to a Group with SSM
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and check each client to add, this adds the clients to the system set manager.
. Navigate to menu:Systems[System Set Manager], and go to the [guimenu]``Groups`` tab.
. Locate the group to join and check [guimenu]``Add``.
. Click btn:[Alter Membership].
. Click btn:[Confirm] to join the clients to the selected group.

For more information about the system set manager, see xref:client-configuration:system-set-manager.adoc[].



You can see which clients are in a group by navigating to menu:Systems[System Groups], clicking the name of the group, and navigating to the [guimenu]``Systems`` tab.
Alternatively, you can see a graphical representation of your system groups by navigating to menu:Systems[Visualization > Systems Grouping].



== Work with Groups

When you have your clients arranged into groups, you can use your groups to manage updates.
For Salt clients, you can also apply states and formulas to all clients in a group.

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups].
The list shows an icon if there are updates available for any of the clients in the group.
Click the icon to see more information about the updates available and to apply them to the clients.

You can also work with more than one group at a time.
Select the groups you want to work with, and click btn:[Work with union] to select every client in every selected group.

Alternatively, you can work on intersections of groups.
Select two or more groups, and click btn:[Work with intersection] to select only those clients that exist in all the selected groups.
For example, you might have one group for all Salt clients, and another group for all SLES clients.
The intersection of these groups would be all Salt SLES clients.
