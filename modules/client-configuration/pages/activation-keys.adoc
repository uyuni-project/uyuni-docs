[[activation-keys]]
= Activation Keys

Activation keys are used with traditional and Salt clients to ensure that your clients have the correct software entitlements, are connecting to the appropriate channels, and are subscribed to the relevant groups.
Each activation key is bound to an organization, which you can set when you create the key.

In {productname}, an activation key is a group of configuration settings with a label.
You can apply all configuration settings associated with an activation key by adding its label as a parameter to a bootstrap script.
We recommend you use an activation key label in combination with a bootstrap script.
When the bootstrap script is executed all configuration settings associated with the label are applied to the system the script is run on.

An activation key can specify:

* Channel assignment
* System types or add-on entitlements
* Contact method
* Configuration files
* Packages to be installed
* System group assignment

Activation keys are used at the time a client is registered, and not used again.
After the client has been registered, the client can be changed in any way, regardless of what the activation key specifies.
The association between the activation key and the client is recorded only for historical purposes.

.Procedure: Creating an Activation Key
. In the {productname} {webui}, as an administrator, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click the btn:[Create Key] button.
. On the [guimenu]``Activation Key Details`` page, in the [guimenu]``Description`` field, enter a description of the activation key.
. In the [guimenu]``Key`` field, enter a name for the activation key.
    For example, ``SLES15-SP4`` for {sles}{nbsp}15{nbsp}SP4.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use commas in the [guimenu]``Key`` field for any {suse} products.
However, you *must* use commas for Red Hat Products.
====
+
. In the [guimenu]``Base Channels`` drop-down box, select the appropriate base software channel, and allow the relevant child channels to populate.
    For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc#vle.webui.admin.wizard.products[] and xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].
. Select the child channels you need (for example, the mandatory {susemgr} tools and updates channels).
. Check the [guimenu]``Add-On System Types`` check box if you need to enable any of the options. 
. We recommend you leave the [guimenu]``Contact Method`` set to [guimenu]``Default``.
. We recommend you leave the [guimenu]``Universal Default`` setting unchecked.
. Click btn:[Create Activation Key] to create the activation key.
. Check the [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` check box to enable configuration management for this key, and click btn:[Update Activation Key] to save this change.
+
[NOTE]
====
The [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` check box does not appear until after you have created the activation key.
Ensure you go back and check the box if you need to enable configuration management.
====



== Combining Multiple Activation Keys

You can combine activation keys when executing the bootstrap script on your traditional clients.
Combining keys allows for more control on what is installed on your systems and reduces duplication of keys for large or complex environments.

[NOTE]
====
Combining activation keys works only on traditional clients.
Salt clients do not support combined activation keys.
If you use a combined key with a Salt client, only the first key is used.
====

You can specify multiple activation keys at the command prompt, or in a single autoinstallation profile.

At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, use the [command]``rhnreg_ks`` command, and separate the key names with a comma.
To specify multiple keys in a {kickstart} profile, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation] and edit the profile you want to use.

Be careful when combining activation keys, as conflicts between some values could cause client registration to fail.
Check that these values do not have conflicting information before you begin:

* Software packages
* Software child channels
* Configuration channels.

If conflicts are detected, they are handled like this:

* Conflicts in base software channels: registration fails.
* Conflicts in system types: registration fails.
* Conflicts in the `enable configuration` flag: configuration management is enabled.
* If one key is system-specific: registration fails.



== Reactivation Keys

Reactivation keys can be used once only to re-register a client and regain all {productname} settings.
Reactivation keys are client-specific, and include the system ID, history, groups, and channels.

To create a reactivation key, navigate to [guimenu]``Systems``, click the client to create a reactivation key for, and navigate to the menu:Details[Reactivation] tab.
Click btn:[Generate New Key] to create the reactivation key.
Record the details of the key for later use.
Unlike typical activation keys, which are not associated with a specific system ID, keys created here do not show up on the menu:Systems[Activation Keys] page.

For Salt clients, after you have created a reactivation key, you can use it as the ``management_key`` grain in [path]``/etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf``. For example:

----
grains:
    susemanager:
        management_key: "re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e"
----

Restart the [command]``salt-minion`` process to apply the reactivation key.

You can use a reactivation key with a bootstrap script.
For more information about bootstrap scripts, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

For traditional clients, after you have created a reactivation key, you can use it with the [command]``rhnreg_ks`` command line utility.
This command re-registers the client and restore its {productname} settings.
On traditional clients, you can combine reactivation keys with activation keys to aggregate the settings of multiple keys for a single system profile.
For example:

----
rhnreg_ks --server=<server-url>/XMLRPC \
          --activationkey=<reactivation-key>,<activationkey> \
          --force
----

[WARNING]
====
If you autoinstall a client with its existing {productname} profile, the profile uses the reactivation key to re-register the system and restore its settings.
Do not regenerate, delete, or use this key while a profile-based autoinstallation is in progress.
Doing so causes the autoinstallation to fail.
====



== Activation Key Best Practices

.Default Parent Channel

Avoid using the [systemitem]``SUSE Manager Default`` parent channel.
This setting forces {productname} to choose a parent channel that best corresponds to the installed operating system, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
Instead, we recommend you create activation keys specific to each distribution and architecture.

.Bootstrapping with Activation Keys

If you are using bootstrap scripts, consider creating an activation key for each script.
This helps you align channel assignments, package installation, system group memberships, and configuration channel assignments.
You also need less manual interaction with your system after registration.

.Bandwidth Requirements

Using activation keys might result in automatic downloading of software at registration time, which might not be desirable in environments where bandwidth is constrained.

These options create bandwidth usage:

* Assigning a SUSE Product Pool channel results in the automatic installation of the corresponding product descriptor package.
* Any package in the [guimenu]``Packages`` section is installed.
* Any Salt state from the [guimenu]``Configuration`` section might trigger downloads depending on its contents.

.Key Label Naming

If you do not enter a human-readable name for your activation keys, the system automatically generates a number string, which can make it difficult to manage your keys.

Consider a naming scheme for your activation keys to help you keep track of them.
Creating names which are associated with your organization's infrastructure makes it easier for you when performing more complex operations.

When creating key labels, consider these tips:

* OS naming (mandatory): Keys should always refer to the OS they provide settings for
* Architecture naming (recommended): Unless your company is running on one architecture only, for example x86_64, then providing labels with an architecture type is a good idea.
* Server type naming: What is this server being used for?
* Location naming: Where is the server located? Room, building, or department?
* Date naming: Maintenance windows, quarter, etc.
* Custom naming: What naming scheme suits your organizations needs?

Example activation key label names:

----
sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64
----

----
sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use commas in the [guimenu]``Key`` field for any {suse} products.
However, you *must* use commas for Red Hat Products.
For more information, see xref:reference:systems/activation-keys.adoc[].
====

.Included Channels

When creating activation keys you also need to keep in mind which software channels are associated with it.
Keys should have a specific base channel assigned to them.
Using the default base channel is not recommended.
For more information, see the client operating system you are installing at xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].

From Reference Guide. This all looks to be duplicate info to me, but I'll leave it here for posterity for the moment. --LKB 2020-09-01

[[ref.webui.systems.activ-keys]]
= Activation Keys

Users with the Activation Key Administrator role (including {productname} Administrators) can generate activation keys in the {productname} {webui}.
With such an activation key, register a {sle} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, entitle the system to the {productname} service level and subscribe the system to specific channels and system groups through the [command]``rhnreg_ks`` command line utility.

[NOTE]
====
System-specific activation keys created through the [guimenu]``Reactivation`` subtab of the [guimenu]``System Details`` page are not part of this list because they are not reusable across systems.
====

For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



[[s3-sm-system-keys-manage]]
== Managing Activation Keys

From the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` page organize activation keys for channel management.

image::systems_activation_keys.png[scaledwidth=80%]

To create an activation key:

[[pro.ref.manager.activationkey]]
.Procedure: Creating Activation Keys
. Select menu:Main Menu[Systems > Activation Keys] from the left bar.
. Click the [guimenu]``Create Key`` link at the upper right corner.
. [guimenu]``Description`` -- Enter a [guimenu]``Description`` to identify the generated activation key.
. [guimenu]``Key`` -- Either choose automatic generation by leaving this field blank or enter the key you want to generate in the [guimenu]``Key`` field. This string of characters can then be used with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` to register client systems with {productname}. For more details, see xref:reference:systems/activation-keys.adoc[].
+
[WARNING]
.Allowed Characters
====
ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2011-03-24 - ke: bwiedemann 20110210:
# wirklich alle? auch "'\ und 0 bytes? Also see the quick starts!
# 2016-02-17 - moio: ," are not allowed <> (){} are removed automatically
endif::showremarks[]

Do not insert commas or double quotes in the key.
All other characters are allowed, but `<> (){}` (this includes the space) are removed automatically.
If the string is empty, a random one is generated.

Commas are problematic because they are used as separator when two or more activation keys are used at once.
====
+
. [guimenu]``Usage`` -- The maximum number systems that can be registered with the activation key concurrently. Leave blank for unlimited use. Deleting a system profile reduces the usage count by one and registering a system profile with the key increases the usage count by one.
. [guimenu]``Base Channels`` -- The primary channel for the key. This can be either the `{productname} Default` channel, a {suse} provided channel, or a custom base channel.
+
Selecting `{productname} Default` allows client systems to register with the {suse}-provided default channel that corresponds with their installed version of {sle}.
You can also associate the key with a custom base channel.
If a system using this key is not compatible with the selected channel, it falls back to the {productname} default channel.
. [guimenu]``Child Channels`` -- When the base channel is selected the list of available child channels are fetched and display in real time below the base channel.
Select the child channels you need (for example, the Tools child channel).
. [guimenu]``Add-on System Types`` -- The supplemental system types for the key, for example, Virtualization Host. All systems receive these system types with the key.
. [guimenu]``Contact Method`` - Select how clients communicate with {productname}. [guimenu]``Default`` (Pull) waits for the client to check in. With [guimenu]``Push via SSH`` and [guimenu]``Push via SSH tunnel`` the server contacts the client via SSH (with or without tunnel) and pushes updates and actions, etc.
+
For more information about contact methods, see
xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-intro.adoc[].


. [guimenu]``Universal Default`` -- Select whether this key should be considered the primary activation key for your organization.
+
.Changing the Default Activation Key
WARNING: Only one universal default activation key can be defined per organization.
If a universal key already exists for this organization, you can unset the currently used universal key by activating the check box.
+

. Click btn:[Create Activation Key].


To create more activation keys, repeat the steps above.

After creating the unique key, it appears in the list of activation keys along with the number of times it has been used.
Only Activation Key Administrators can see this list.
At this point, you can configure the key further.
For example, associate the key with packages (for example, the [package]#mgr-cfg-actions#  package) and groups.
Systems registered with the key get automatically subscribed to them.

To change the settings of a key, click the key's description in the list to display its [guimenu]``Details`` page. Via additional tabs you can select packages, configuration channels, group membership, and view activated systems.
Modify the appropriate tab then click the btn:[Update Activation Key] button.
To disassociate groups from a key, deselect them in the respective menus by kbd:[Ctrl]-clicking their highlighted names.
To remove a key entirely, click the [guimenu]``Delete Key`` link in the upper right corner of the [guimenu]``Details`` page.
In the upper right corner find also the [guimenu]``Clone Key`` link.

image::systems_activation_key_details.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Any (client tools) package installation requires that the Client Tools channel is available and the [guimenu]``Provisioning`` check box is selected.
The Client Tools channel should be selected in the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` listing below the selected base channel.

After creating the activation key, you can see in the [guimenu]``Details`` tab a check box named [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment``.
If you select it, all needed packages are automatically added to the [guimenu]``Packages`` list.
In case of Salt clients the [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` option also ensures that highstate is applied automatically.
By default, the following packages are added: [package]#mgr-cfg#, [package]#mgr-cfg-client#, and [package]#mgr-cfg-actions#.

If you select [guimenu]``Virtualization Host`` you automatically get the following package: [package]#mgr-virtualization-host#.

Adding the [package]#mgr-osad# package makes sense to execute scheduled actions immediately after the schedule time.
When the activation key is created, you can add packages with selecting the key (menu:Main Menu[Systems > Activation Keys]), then on the activation key details page, go for the [guimenu]``Packages`` tab and add [package]#mgr-osad#.

To disable system activations with a key, uncheck the corresponding box in the [guimenu]``Enabled`` column in the key list.
The key can be re-enabled by selecting the check box.
Click the btn:[Update Activation Keys] button on the bottom right-hand corner of the page to apply your changes.



[[s3-sm-system-keys-multiple]]
== Using Multiple Activation Keys at Once

Multiple activation keys can be specified at the command line or in a single autoinstallation profile with traditional clients.

// Does it make sense to mention this restriction here, too? 2020-04-23, ke.
// https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1164451
[NOTE]
====
With Salt clients, you cannot combine activation keys.
Only the first key is used.
====

This allows you to aggregate the aspects of various keys without re-creating a specific key for every system that you want to register, simplifying the registration and autoinstallation processes while slowing the growth of your key list.
Separate keys with a comma at the command line with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` or in a {kickstart} profile in the [guimenu]``Activation Keys`` tab of the [guimenu]``Autoinstallation Details`` page.

Registering with multiple activation keys requires some caution.
Conflicts between some values cause registration to fail.
Conflicts in the following values do not cause registration to fail, a combination of values is applied: software packages, software child channels, and configuration channels.
Conflicts in the remaining properties are resolved in the following manner:

* Base software channels: registration fails.
* System types: registration fails.
* Enable configuration flag: configuration management is set.


Do not use system-specific activation keys along with other activation keys; registration fails in this event.

You are now ready to use multiple activation keys at once.
