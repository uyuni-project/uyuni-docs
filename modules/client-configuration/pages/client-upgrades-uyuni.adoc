= Upgrade Uyuni Clients

In this section, we use openSUSE Leap as an example.

== Prepare to Upgrade

.Procedure: Preparing the Client Upgrade
. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, use the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` command to add the appropriate channels.
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels \
opensuse_leap15_4 \
opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss \
opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates \
opensuse_leap15_4-updates \
opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client
----

. Fully synchronize all channels with [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync``.
  In case of already defined repository URLs, continue with
  xref:installation-and-upgrade:proxy-uyuni.adoc#uyuni-202007-channeldupes[].
+
// These are custom channels.
// For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[].

. In the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels] and click the [systemitem]``Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64)`` channel name.

. In the upper right corner, click btn:[Manage Channel].

. Click the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab, and select [systemitem]``External - Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.3 (x86_64)``.

. Click btn:[Update Repositories].

. Navigate to menu:Repositories[Sync] subtab, and click btn:[Sync Now].

. Do the same with [systemitem]``openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64)`` and [systemitem]``External - openSUSE Leap 15.3 (x86_64)``.

Unfold [systemitem]``openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64)`` to see all child channels populated with packages.



== Upgrade

To upgrade a client you replace the software repositories and update the software, and finally reboot the client.



.Procedure: Upgrading the Client

////
For standard clients, reactivation is not required.

. In the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to client system's  details page, and click the [guimenu]``Reactivation`` subtab.

. Click btn:[Generate New Key] to generate a reactivation key.
+
With a system profile specific activation key, this system can be re-registered using the 'rhnreg_ks' command-line utility. The system is re-registered with the same id, history, groups, and channels (unless the system's base channel changes).
Key: 	  re-1-1008b9843d44dac77f0a856f207cc2c6
////
+
. In the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[] and click the name of the client.
. Click menu:Software[Software Channels], and as the base channel select the openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} channel that is listed in the [systemitem]``Customs Channels`` list.
. In the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` pane, select the {opensuse-version} child channels.
. Click btn:[Next], and [guimenu]``Confirm Software Channel Change`` with btn:[Confirm].
. Click menu:Software[Packages > Upgrade], and select all the packages to be updated on the client, and then apply the selection.
  Click btn:[Upgrade Packages], check the details, and click btn:[Confirm] to complete the update.
+
// . Re-register with the reactivation key using the [command]``rhnreg_ks`` command-line utility.
+
//  The system is re-registered with the same id, history, and groups.
+
// and channels (unless the system's base channel changes).
. Reboot the client.

If you need to update many clients, you can create an action chain of this command sequence on the {productname} Server.
You can use the action chain to perform updates on multiple clients at the same time.


////
. Assign the new channels to the clients instead of the old channels.

. Update all the packages.  This can either be done with the {webui} or better run [command]``zypper dup`` manually on the command line local on the systems or remotely as a Salt command.
////

////
I think the better way to document this is if giving it a try. Create an Uyuni server, sync Leap 15.1 (spacewalk-common-channels), create a Leap 15.1, onboard it, sync Leap 15.2 (spacewalk-common-channels), and then try to adjust the channels and trying to upgrade. I recommend you use VMs and take snapshots of the VMs so you can repeat steps as needed.
////

////
But for now you need to create and mirror at least the target channels with spacewalk-common-channels.

You adjust the channels for the client and best is to call "zypper dup". Either from the commandline on that system or using remote command.
