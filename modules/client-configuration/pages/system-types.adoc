= System Types

Clients are categorized by system type.
Every client can have both a base system type, and an add-on system type assigned.

Base system type is ``Salt`` forÂ all clients.

Add-on system types include ``Virtualization Host``, for clients that operate as virtual hosts, 
and ``Container Build Host`` for clients that operate as a build host.

You can adjust the add-on system type by navigating to menu:Systems[System List > System Types].
Check the clients you want to change the add-on system type for, select the [guimenu]``Add-On System Type``, and click either btn:[Add System Type] or btn:[Remove System Type].
