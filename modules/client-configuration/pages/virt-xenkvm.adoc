[[virt-xenkvm]]
= Virtualization with Xen and KVM

Xen and KVM virtualized clients can be managed directly in {productname}.

To begin, you will need to set up a virtual host on your {productname} Server.
You can then set up autoinstallation using {ay} or {kickstart} for future virtual hosts, and for virtual guests.

This section also includes information about administering your virtual guests after they have been installed.



== Host Setup

The way that you set up Xen or KVM on a VM host depends on what operating system you want to use on its associated guests.

For {suse} operating systems, see the SLES Virtualization Guide available from https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/book-virt.html.

For {rhel} operating systems, refer to the Red Hat documentation for your version.

{productname} uses [systemitem]``libvirt`` to install and manage guests.
You must have the [daemon]``libvirtd`` package installed on your host.
In most cases, the default settings are usually sufficient, and you should not need to adjust them.
However, if you want to access the VNC console on your guests as a non-root user, you will need to perform some configuration changes.
For more information about how to set this up, consult the relevant documentation for your operating system.

You will require a bootstrap script on the {productname} Server.
Your bootstrap script must include the activation key for your host.
We also recommend that you include your GPG key for additional security.
For more on creating a bootstrap script, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

When your bootstrap script is ready, execute it on the host to register it with the {productname} Server.
For more on client registration, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].

For Salt clients, you will need to enable the [systemitem]``Virtualization Host`` entitlement.
This allows you to see VM changes instantly.
To do this, in the {productname} {webui}, navigate to the [guimenu]``System Details`` page for the host, and click on the [guimenu]``Properties`` tab.
Alternatively, the [systemitem]``Virtualization Host`` entitlement can be added at the registration key level.
In the [guimenu]``Add-On System Types`` section, check [guimenu]``Virtualization Host``, and click btn:[Update Properties] to save the changes.
Restart the Salt minion service to activate the change:

----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----

For traditional clients, by default, VM hosts use the [systemitem]``rhnsd`` service  to check for scheduled actions.
The check occurs every four hours, to balance load in environments where there are a lot of clients.
This can create delays of up to four hours before an action is carried out.
When you are managing VM guests, this long delay is not always ideal, especially for actions like rebooting a guest.
To address this, you can disable the [systemitem]``rhnsd`` service, and enable the [daemon]``osad`` service.
The [daemon]``osad`` service receives commands using a jabber protocol, and will execute commands instantly.

To disable the [systemitem]``rhnsd`` service, and enable the [daemon]``osad`` daemon, run these commands as the root user:

----
service rhnsd stop
service rhnsd disable
----

----
service osad enable
service osad start
----

== Autoinstallation


You can use {ay} or {kickstart} to automatically install and register Xen and KVM guests.

You will require an activation key for the VM host you want to register the guests to, and for each guest.
Your activation key must have the [systemitem]``provisioning`` and [systemitem]``Virtualization Platform`` entitlements.
Your activation key must also have access to the [package]``mgr-virtualization-host`` and  [package]``mgr-osad`` packages.
For more on creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].

If you want to automatically register the guests with {productname} after installation, you will need to create a bootstrap script.
For more on creating a bootstrap script, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Autoinstallation of VM guests works only if they are configured as Traditional clients.
Salt clients can be created using a template disk image, but not by using {ay} or {kickstart}.
====



=== Create an Autoinstallable Distribution

You will need to create an autoinstallable distribution on the VM host to be able to autoinstall clients from {productname}.
The distribution can be made available from a mounted local or remote directory, or on a loop-mounted ISO image.

The configuration of the autoinstallable distribution will differ depending on whether you are using a SLES or {rhel} operating system on your guests.
The packages for a {rhel} installation are fetched from the associated base channel.
Packages for installing {suse} systems are fetched from the autoinstallable distribution.
Therefore, for SLES systems, the autoinstallable distribution must be a complete installation source.

.Paths for autoinstallable distributions
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Operating System Type | Kernel Location | initrd Location
| {rhel} | [path]``images/pxeboot/vmlinuz``    | [path]``images/pxeboot/initrd.img``
| SLES | [path]``boot/<arch>/loader/initrd`` | [path]``boot/<arch>/loader/linux``
|===

In all cases, ensure that the base channel matches the autoinstallable distribution.

Before you begin, ensure you have a installation media available to your VM Host.
It can be on a network resource, a local directory, or an loop-mounted ISO image.
Additionally, ensure that all files and directories are world-readable.


.Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallable Distribution

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Distributions] and click btn:[Create Distribution].
. In the [guimenu]``Create Autoinstallable Distribution`` section, use these parameters:
* In the [guimenu]``Distribution Label`` section, type a unique name for the distribution.
    Use only letters, numbers, hyphens (``-``), periods  (``.``), and underscores (``_``), and ensure the name is longer than four characters.
* In the [guimenu]``Tree Path`` field, type an absolute path to the installation source.
* In the [guimenu]``Base Channel`` field, select the channel that matches the installation source.
    This channel is used as the package source for non-{suse} installations.
* In the [guimenu]``Installer Generation`` field, select the operating system version that matches the installation source.
* In the [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` field, type any options to be passed to the kernel when booting for the installation.
    The [option]``install=`` parameter and the [option]``self_update=0 pt.options=self_update`` parameter are added by default.
* In the [guimenu]``Post Kernel Options`` section, type any options to  be passed to the kernel when booting the installed system for the first time.
. Click btn:[Create Autoinstallable Distribution] to save.

When you have created an autoinstallable distribution, you can edit it by navigating to  menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Distributions] and selecting the distribution you want to edit.



=== Create and Upload an Autoinstallation Profile

Autoinstallation profiles contain all the installation and configuration data needed to install a system.
They can also contain scripts to be executed after the installation is complete.

{kickstart} profiles can be created using the {productname} {webui}, by navigating to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles], clicking btn:[Create New Kickstart File], and following the prompts.
You can also create {ay} or {kickstart} autoinstallation profiles by hand.

An example {ay} profile that includes a script for registering the client with {productname} is available in xref:client-configuration:autoyast-example.adoc[].
If you are using {ay} to install SLES, you will also need to include this snippet:

----
<products config:type="list">
  <listentry>SLES</listentry>
</products>
----

* For more on {ay}, see xref:client-configuration:autoinst-intro.adoc[].
* For more on {kickstart}, see xref:client-configuration:kickstart.adoc[], or refer to the Red Hat documentation for your installation.



.Procedure: Uploading an Autoinstallation Profile

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles] and click btn:[Upload Kickstart/AutoYaST File].
. In the [guimenu]``Create Autoinstallation Profile`` section, use these parameters:
* In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, type a unique name for the profile.
    Use only letters, numbers, hyphens (``-``), periods  (``.``), and underscores (``_``), and ensure the name is longer than six characters.
* In the [guimenu]``Autoinstall Tree`` field, select the autoinstallable distribution you created earlier.
* In the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type`` field, select the relevant Guest type (for example, [parameter]``KVM Virtualized Guest``.
    Do not choose [guimenu]``Xen Virtualized Host`` here.
* OPTIONAL: If you want to manually create your autoinstallation profile, you can type it directly into the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field.
    If you have a file already created, leave the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field blank.
* In the [guimenu]``File to Upload`` field, click btn:[Choose File], and use the system dialog to select the file to upload.
    If the file is successfully uploaded, the filename will be shown in the [guimenu]``File to Upload`` field.
* The contents of the uploaded file will be shown in the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field.
    If you need to make edits, you can do so directly.
. Click btn:[Create] to save your changes and store the profile.

When you have created an autoinstallation profile, you can edit it by navigating to  menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles] and selecting the profile you want to edit.
Make the desired changes and save your settings by clicking btn:[Create].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you change the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type`` of an existing {kickstart} profile, it might also modify the bootloader and partition options, potentially overwriting any custom settings.
Carefully review the [guimenu]``Partitioning`` tab to verify these settings before making changes.
====



=== Automatically Register Guests


When you install VM guests automatically, they are not registered to {productname}.
If you want your guests to be automatically registered as soon as they are installed, you can add a section to the autoinstallation profile that invokes a bootstrap script, and registers the guests.

This section gives instructions for adding a bootstrap script to an existing {ay} profile.

For more on creating a bootstrap script, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
For instructions on how to do this for {kickstart], refer to the Red Hat documentation for your installation.

.Procedure: Adding a Bootstrap Script to an {ay} Profile

. Ensure your bootstrap script contains the activation key for the VM guests you want to register with it, and that is located on the host at [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap_vm_guests.sh``.
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Profiles], and select the {ay} profile to associate this script with.
. In the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field, add this snippet at the end of the file, immediately before the closing ``</profile>`` tag.
    Ensure you replace the example IP address in the snippet with the correct IP address for your {productname} Server:
+
----
<scripts>
  <init-scripts config:type="list">
    <script>
      <interpreter>shell </interpreter>
      <location>
        http://`192.168.1.1`/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_vm_guests.sh
      </location>
    </script>
  </init-scripts>
</scripts>
----
+
. Click menu:Update[] to save your changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your {ay} profile already contains a ``<scripts>`` section, do not add a second one.
Place the bootstrap snippet inside the existing ``<scripts>`` section.
====


=== Autoinstall VM Guests


Once you have everything set up, you can start to autoinstall your VM guests.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each VM host can only install one guest at a time.
If you are scheduling more than one autoinstallation, make sure you time them so that the next installation does not begin before the previous one has completed.
If a guest installation starts while another one is still running, the running installation will be canceled.
====


. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Overview], and select the VM host you want to install guests on.
. Navigate to the [guiitem]``Virtualization`` tab, and the [guimenu]``Provisioning`` subtab.
. Select the autoinstallation profile you want to use, and specify a unique name for the guest.
. Choose a proxy if applicable and enter a schedule.
. To change the guest's hardware profile and configuration options, click btn:[Advanced Options].
. Click btn:[Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish] to complete.



== Manage VM Guests


You can use the {productname} {webui} to manage your VM Guests, including actions like shutting down, restarting, and adjusting CPU and memory allocations.

To do this, you will need your Xen or KVM VM host registered to the {productname} Server, and have the [daemon]``libvirtd`` service running on the host.
For traditional clients, you will also need the [package]``mgr-cfg-actions`` package installed on your {productname} Server.

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List], and click on the VM host for the guests you want to manage.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Virtualization`` tab to see all guests registered to this host, and access the management functions.

For more information on managing VM guests using the {webui}, see xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-virtualization.adoc[].
