= System Set Manager

The system set manager (SSM) is used to perform actions on more than one client at a time.
SSM creates ephemeral sets of clients, making it useful for one-off actions that you need to apply to a number of clients.
If you want more permanent sets, consider using system groups instead.
For more information about system groups, see xref:client-configuration:system-groups.adoc[].


The actions available for use in SSM are listed in this table.
The icons in this table indicate:

* {check} this action is available in SSM for this client type
* {cross} this action is not available in SSM for this client type
* {question} this action is under consideration for this client type, and may or may not be supported at a later date.

[NOTE]
====
The details in SSM might differ slightly from the details in other parts of the {productname} {webui}.
In SSM, all available updates are shown.
This allows you to upgrade to packages that might not be the latest version.
====



== Change Base Channels inÂ SSM

You can use SSM to change the base channel of more than one client at the same time.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the base channel significantly changes the packages and patches available to the affected clients.
Use with caution.
