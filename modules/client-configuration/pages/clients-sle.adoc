= Registering {sle} Clients

This section contains information about registering clients running {sle} operating systems.

// There are probably some support statements that we need to make here. Are SLE clients supported on Uyuni? --LKB 2020-08-12


== Add Software Channels

Before you register {sle} clients to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {sle} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[sle-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.SLE Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version
| Product Name

| {sles} 15 SP1
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 x86_64

| {sles} 15 SP2
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 x86_64

|===

include::snippets/add_channels_wizard.adoc[]



ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

To add the client tools, add these channels from the command prompt:

[[sle-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.OpenSUSE Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Client Channel

| {sles} 15 SP1
| sles15-sp1-uyuni-client


| {sles} 15 SP2
| sles15-sp2-uyuni-client

|===

== Check Synchronization Status

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_suma.adoc[]

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_uyuni.adoc[]

endif::[]

include::snippets/check_sync_cli.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sle} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

endif::[]



== Register Clients

To register your {sle} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
