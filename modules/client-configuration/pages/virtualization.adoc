= Virtualization

You can use {productname} to manage virtualized clients in addition to regular traditional or Salt clients.
In this type of installation, a virtual host is installed on the {productname} Server to manage any number of virtual guests.
If you choose to, you can install several virtual hosts to manage groups of guests.

The range of capabilities that virtualized clients have depends on the third-party virtualization provider you choose.

Xen and KVM hosts and guests can be managed directly in {productname}.
This enables you to autoinstall hosts and guests using {ay} or {kickstart}, and manage guests in the {webui}.

For VMWare, including VMWare vSphere, {productname} requires you to set up a virtual host manager (VHM) to control the VMs.
This gives you control over the hosts and guests, but in a more limited way than available with Xen and KVM.


//So I looked it up in their docs: "VMWare vSphere is a suite of virtualization applications that includes ESXi and vCenter Server". So I think using "VMWare vSphere" implies ESXi and vCenter without having to spell them out. Happy to be proven wrong. --LKB 2019-07-10

Other third-party virtualization providers are not directly supported by {productname}.
However, if your provider allows you to export a JSON configuration file for the VM, you can upload that configuration file to {productname} and manage it with a VHM.



// We could probably use a diagram here, to convey the meaning behind this:
// Virtual Host Managers (VHMs) can be used to manage one or more virtual hosts.
// Virtual Hosts are hypervisors provided by a third party.
// Each virtual host can contain one or more virtual guests.
