== Create a Kickstart Profile


Click on the [guimenu]``Create Kickstart Profile`` link from the menu:Main Menu[Systems > Autoinstallation] page to start the wizard that populates the base values needed for a Kickstart profile.


image::create_profile_wizard.png[scaledwidth=444]


.Procedure: Creating a Kickstart Profile
. On the first line, enter a Kickstart profile label. This label cannot contain spaces, so use dashes (``-``) or underscores (``\_``) as separators.
. Select a [guimenu]``Base Channel`` for this profile, which consists of packages based on a specific architecture and Red Hat Enterprise Linux release.
+
.Creating Base Channel
NOTE: Base channels are only available if a suitable distribution is created first.
For creating distributions, see
xref:reference:systems/autoinst-distributions.adoc[]

+

+
.Using SALT for registration
NOTE: Using ``salt_enabled_kickstart_install_types`` property in ``rhn.conf``, one can configure to use ``salt`` for registraion instead of traditional stack.
By default this is set to ``rhel_8`` as we do not ship traditional stack for RES8.

+

. Select an [guimenu]``Kickstartable Tree`` for this profile. The [guimenu]``Kickstartable Tree`` drop-down menu is only populated if one or more distributions have been created for the selected base channel (see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-distributions.adoc[]).
. Instead of selecting a specific tree, you can also check the box [guimenu]``Always use the newest Tree for this base channel``. This setting lets {productname} automatically pick the latest tree that is associated with the specified base channels. If you add new trees later, {productname} will always keep the most recently created or modified.
. Select the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type`` from the drop-down menu.
+
NOTE: If you do not intend to use the Kickstart profile to create virtual guest systems, you can leave the drop-down at the default [guimenu]``None`` choice.
+

. On the second page, select (or enter) the location of the Kickstart tree.
. On the third page, select a root password for the system.


Depending on your base channel, your newly created Kickstart profile might be subscribed to a channel that is missing required packages.
For {kickstart} to work properly, the following packages should be present in its base channel: [package]``pyOpenSSL``, [package]``rhnlib``, [package]``libxml2-python``, and [package]``spacewalk-koan`` and associated packages.

To resolve this issue:

* Make sure that the Tools software channel for the Kickstart profile's base channel is available to your organization. If it is not, you must request entitlements for the Tools software channel from the {productname} administrator.
* Make sure that the Tools software channel for this Kickstart profile's base channel is available to your {productname} as a child channel.
* Make sure that [package]``rhn-kickstart`` and associated packages corresponding to this {kickstart} are available in the Tools child channel.


The final stage of the wizard presents the menu:Autoinstallation Details[Details] tab.
On this tab and the other subtabs, nearly every option for the new Kickstart profile can be customized.

Once created, you can access the Kickstart profile by downloading it from the [guimenu]``Autoinstallation Details`` page by clicking the [guimenu]``Autoinstallation File`` subtab and clicking the [guimenu]``Download Autoinstallation File`` link.

If the Kickstart file is _not_ managed by {productname}, you can access it via the following URL:

----
http://`my.manager.server`/ks/dist/ks-rhel-`ARCH`-`VARIANT`-`VERSION`
----


In the above example, [replaceable]``ARCH`` is the architecture of the Kickstart file, [replaceable]``VARIANT`` is either `client` or ``server``, and [replaceable]``VERSION`` is the release of {rhel} associated with the Kickstart file.



[[s4-system-ks-details-details]]
== Profile Details

On the menu:Autoinstallation Details[Details] page, you have the following options:

* Change the profile [guimenu]``Label``.
* Change the operating system by clicking [guimenu]``(Change)``.
* Change the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type``.
+
NOTE: Changing the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type`` may require changes to the Kickstart profile bootloader and partition options, potentially overwriting user customizations.
Consult the [guimenu]``Partitioning`` tab to verify any new or changed settings.
+

* Change the amount of [guimenu]``Virtual Memory`` (in Megabytes of RAM) allocated to virtual guests autoinstalled with this profile.
* Change the number of [guimenu]``Virtual CPUs`` for each virtual guest.
* Change the [guimenu]``Virtual Storage Path`` from the default in [path]``/var/lib/xen/`` .
* Change the amount of [guimenu]``Virtual Disk Space`` (in GB) allotted to each virtual guest.
* Change the [guimenu]``Virtual Bridge`` for networking of the virtual guest.
* Deactivate the profile so that it cannot be used to schedule a {kickstart} by removing the [guimenu]``Active`` check mark.
* Check whether to enable logging for custom [option]``%post`` scripts to the [path]``/root/ks-post.log`` file.
* Decide whether to enable logging for custom [option]``%pre`` scripts to the [path]``/root/ks-pre.log`` file.
* Choose whether to preserve the [path]``ks.cfg`` file and all `%include` fragments to the [path]``/root/`` directory of all systems autoinstalled with this profile.
* Select whether this profile is the default for all of your organization's {kickstart}s by checking or unchecking the box.
* Add any [guimenu]``Kernel Options`` in the corresponding text box.
* Add any [guimenu]``Post Kernel Options`` in the corresponding text box.
* Enter comments that are useful to you in distinguishing this profile from others.



[[s4-system-ks-details-options]]
== Operating System

On this page, you can make the following changes to the operating system that the Kickstart profile installs:

Change the base channel::
Select from the available base channels. {productname} administrators see a list of all base channels that are currently synced to the {productname}.

Child Channels::
Subscribe to available child channels of the base channel, such as the Tools channel.

Available Trees::
Use the drop-down menu to choose from available trees associated with the base channel.

Always use the newest Tree for this base channel.::
Instead of selecting a specific tree, you can also check the box menu:Always use the newest Tree for this base channel.[]
This setting lets {productname} automatically pick the latest tree that is associated with the specified base channels.
If you add new trees later, {productname} will always keep the most recently created or modified.

Software URL (File Location)::
The exact location from which the Kickstart tree is mounted.
This value is determined when the profile is created.
You can view it on this page but you cannot change it.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-details-variables]]
== Variables

Autoinstallation variables can substitute values in Kickstart and {ay} profiles.
To define a variable, create a name-value pair ([replaceable]``name/value``) in the text box.

For example, if you want to autoinstall a system that joins the network of a specified organization (for example the Engineering department), you can create a profile variable to set the IP address and the gateway server address to a variable that any system using that profile will use.
Add the following line to the [guimenu]``Variables`` text box.

----
IPADDR=192.168.0.28
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
----


Now you can use the name of the variable in the profile instead of a specific value.
For example, the [option]``network`` part of a Kickstart file looks like the following:

----
network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$IPADDR \
  --gateway=$GATEWAY
----


The [option]``$IPADDR`` will be resolved to ``192.168.0.28``, and the [option]``$GATEWAY`` to `192.168.0.1`

[NOTE]
====
There is a hierarchy when creating and using variables in Kickstart files.
System Kickstart variables take precedence over [guimenu]``Profile`` variables, which in turn take precedence over [guimenu]``Distribution`` variables.
Understanding this hierarchy can alleviate confusion when using variables in {kickstart}s.
====


Using variables are just one part of the larger Cobbler infrastructure for creating templates that can be shared between multiple profiles and systems.
For more about Cobbler and templates, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].



[[s4-sm-system-kick-details-advanced]]
== Advanced Options

From this page, you can toggle several installation options on and off by checking and unchecking the boxes to the left of the option.

----



[[s4-system-ks-sysd-file-pres]]
== File Preservation

If you have previously created a file preservation list, include this list as part of the {kickstart}.
This will protect the listed files from being over-written during the installation process.
For more on file preservation lists, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-file-preservation.adoc[].



[[s4-system-ks-sysd-gpg-ssl]]
== GPG & SSL

image::details-ks-6.png[scaledwidth=444]


The [guimenu]``Activation Keys`` tab allows you to select Activation Keys to include as part of the Kickstart profile.
These keys, which must be created before the Kickstart profile, will be used when re-registering kickstarted systems.




[[s4-system-ks-scripts]]
== Scripts

.Scripts
image::details-ks-7.png[scaledwidth=444]

The [guimenu]``Scripts`` tab is where [option]``%pre`` and [option]``%post`` scripts are created.
This page lists any scripts that have already been created for this Kickstart profile.
To create a Kickstart script, perform the following procedure:

. Click the [guimenu]``add new kickstart script`` link in the upper right corner.
. Enter the path to the scripting language used to create the script, such as ``/usr/bin/perl``.
. Enter the full script in the large text box.
. Indicate whether this script is to be executed in the [option]``%pre`` or [option]``%post`` section of the Kickstart process.
. Indicate whether this script is to run outside of the chroot environment. Refer to the [ref]_Post-installation Script_ section of the [ref]_Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Administration Guide_ for further explanation of the [option]``nochroot`` option.

[NOTE]
====
{productname} supports the inclusion of separate files within the Partition Details section of the Kickstart profile.
For instance, you may dynamically generate a partition file based on the machine type and number of disks at {kickstart} time.
This file can be created via [option]``%pre`` script and placed on the system, such as [path]``/tmp/part-include``.
Then you can call for that file by entering the following line in the Partition Details field of the menu:System Details[Partitioning] tab:

----
%include /tmp/part-include
----
====



[[s4-system-ks-ks-file]]
== Autoinstallation File

.Autoinstallation File
image::details-ks-8.png[scaledwidth=444]

The [guimenu]``Autoinstallation File`` tab allows you to view or download the profile that has been generated from the options chosen in the previous tabs.



[[ref.webui.systems.autoinst.profiles.upload]]
== Upload Kickstart/{ay} File

Click the [guimenu]``Upload Kickstart/Autoyast File`` link from the menu:Systems[Autoinstallation] page to upload an externally prepared {ay} or Kickstart profile.

. In the first line, enter a profile [guimenu]``Label`` for the automated installation. This label[] drop-down menu is only populated if one or more distributions have been created for the selected base channel (see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-distributions.adoc[]).
. Instead of selecting a specific tree, you can also check the box [guimenu]``Always use the newest Tree`` for this base channel. This setting lets {productname} automatically pick the latest tree that is associated with the specified base channels. If you add new trees later, {productname} will always keep the most recently created or modified.
. Select the [guimenu]``Virtualization Type`` from the drop-down menu. For more information about virtualization with **traditional clients**, see xref:client-configuration:virtualization.adoc[].

+
NOTE: If you do not intend to use the autoinstall profile to create virtual guest systems, you can leave the drop-down set to the default choice [guimenu]``KVM Virtualized Guest``.
+

. Either cut-and-paste the file contents, or update the file from the local storage medium:
** Paste it into the [guimenu]``File Contents`` box and click [guimenu]``Create``, or
** enter the file name in the [guimenu]``File to Upload`` field and click btn:[Upload File].

Four subtabs are now available:

* [guimenu]``Details``
* [guimenu]``Bare Metal``
* [guimenu]``Variables``
* [guimenu]``Autoinstallable File``




== File Preservation

Collects lists of files to be protected and re-deployed on systems during {kickstart}.
For instance, if you have many custom configuration files located on a system to be kickstarted, enter them here as a list and associate that list with the Kickstart profile to be used.

To use this feature, click the [guimenu]``Create File Preservation List`` link at the top.
Enter a suitable label and all files and directories to be preserved.
Enter absolute paths to all files and directories.
Then click btn:[Create List].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although file preservation is useful, it does have limitations.
Each list is limited to a total size of 1Â MB.
Special devices like [path]``/dev/hda1`` and [path]``/dev/sda1`` are not supported.
Only file and directory names may be entered.
No regular expression wildcards can be used.
====

When finished, you may include the file preservation list in the Kickstart profile to be used on systems containing those files.

For more information, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-profiles.adoc#ref.webui.systems.autoinst.profiles.create[].

The menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > AutoinstallationÂ Snippets] section allows you to store code snippets, to use them in autoinstallation profiles later on.

Click btn:[Create Snippet] to create a new code snippet.

Default snippets coming with {productname} are not editable.
You can use a snippet, if you add the [guimenu]``Snippet Macro`` statement such as `$SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script')` to your autoinstallation profile.
This is an {ay} profile example:

----
<init-scripts config:type="list">
  $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script')
</init-scripts>
----

When you create a snippet with the [guimenu]``Create Snippet`` link, all profiles including that snippet will be updated accordingly.


Custom Snippets

This is the tab with custom snippets.
Click a name of a snippet to view, edit, or delete it.


All Snippets
