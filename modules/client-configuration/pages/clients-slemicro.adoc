= Registering {nbsp}{micro} Clients

This section contains information about registering clients running these {nbsp}{micro} operating systems:

* {nbsp}{micro}{nbsp}5.0 {x86_64}
* {nbsp}{micro}{nbsp}5.0 {arm64}

[WARNING]
====
Support for {nbsp}{micro} clients is provided as a technology preview for testing purposes, and not all features are fully functional at this stage.
This feature is expected to be fully supported in a later version of {productname}.
Do not use this feature on production systems.

== Add Software Channels

Before you register {nbsp}{micro} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
The products you need for this procedure are:

[[slemicro-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.SLE Micro Products - WebUI
|===

| OS Version
| Product Name

| {nbsp}{micro} 5.0 {x86_64}
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro 5.0 aarch64

| {nbsp}{micro} 5.0 {arm64}
| SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro 5.0 x86_64

|===

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[slemicro-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
.SLE Micro Products - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Updates Channel

| {nbsp}{micro} 5.0 {x86_64}
| suse-microos-5.0-pool-x86_64
| suse-microos-5.0-updates-x86_64

| {nbsp}{micro} 5.0 {arm64}
| suse-microos-5.0-pool-aarch64

== Register Clients

////
To register your {nbsp}{micro} clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo
----
