= Preparation

A configured distribution and an autoinstallation profile is required.

.Procedure: Preparing a Distribution

. Provide the files required to start an installation.
Unpack an installation medium such as a DVD image on your Server.
It contains the Linux kernel, an initrd, and other files required to boot the OS in installation mode.

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:System[Autoinstallation > Distributions].

. In the [guimenu]``Autoinstallable Distributions`` dialog, click [guimenu]``Create Distribution``:
* In the [guimenu]``Distribution Label`` field, enter a name to identify your autoinstallable distribution.
* In the [guimenu]``Tree Path`` field, enter the path to an installation tree located on your {productname} Server.
* Select the matching [guimenu]``Base Channel`` mirrored on the {productname} Server.
This base channel must represent the distribution you want to install.
It can be the [guimenu]``Vendor``, [guimenu]``Custom``, or [guimenu]``Cloned Channels``.
* The [guimenu]``Installer Generation`` should also match.
* Optionally, you can specify kernel options which should be added when booting this distribution.
Note that there are multiple places where you can provide kernel options.
Only add options here that are generic for the distribution.
. Click btn:[Create Autoinstallable Distribution].

For more information, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-distributions.adoc[].


.Procedure: Preparing a Profile

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:System[Autoinstallation > Profiles].

. In the [guimenu]``Autoinstallation Profiles`` dialog, add the profile for your  autoinstallation.
It can be an ``AutoYaST`` or ``Kickstart`` profile.

. There are two ways to create profiles:
* Create a ``Kickstart`` profile using a wizard
* Upload an externally created profile (``Kickstart`` or ``AutoYaST``)

For more information about the ``Kickstart`` wizard, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-profiles.adoc[].



== Upload a Profile

Profiles require a label, and an ``Autoinstallation Tree`` (distribution).

// Virtualization type.
// later?  and again kernel options.

Upload the ``Kickstart`` or ``AutoyaST`` profile.
You can write your own kickstart or {ay} profile directly in the {webui}, or create the profile and upload it from your local file system.

AutoYaST is able to dump a profile from an existing installation.
This can be used as template, but will need to be edited to make it usable by {productname}.

.Procedure: Making an AutoYaST Template Usable by {productname}
. Change the [literal]``add-on`` section and add {productname} URLs.
The URL must use this format:
+
----
http://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/<channel-label>/<distribution-label>
----
. Replace [literal]``<channel-label>`` and [literal]``<distribution-label>`` with the correct labels.
You can also use a variable for `distribution-label`.
Ensure that the distribution label corresponds to the autoinstallable distribution you selected.
You can only configure child channels in this file.
The channels must be children of the base channel you selected in the distribution you use for this profile.
You do not need to specify a base channel.
The base channel is defined in the distribution.
. Register the system after it is installed.
For this step we provide script snippets that can be used.
+
For Salt managed clients, use the `spacewalk/minion_script` snippet:
+
----
<scripts>
  <init-scripts config:type="list">
    $SNIPPET('spacewalk/minion_script')
  </init-scripts>
</scripts>
----
+
For traditional clients, use the `spacewalk/sles_register_script` snippet:
+
----
<scripts>
  <init-scripts config:type="list">
    $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script')
  </init-scripts>
</scripts>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For registering Salt clients, you must accept the Salt key on the {productname} Server before you attempt autoinstallation.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you change the distribution label, it will not automatically change the [parameter]``install=`` kernel option.
You will need to manually change the kernel options to match the distribution label.

For more information about autoinstallation profiles, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-profiles.adoc[].



== Variables and snippets

Profiles are not finalized until they are requested by a client.
This allows you to use variables in profiles.
You can define profile variables in the {webui} by navigating to menu:Profiles[Variables].

Some common variables are:

redhat_management_server::
The server {redhat} clients register to (automatically set).
org::
The organization ID where this profile is created (automatically set).
registration_key::
The key used in the registration snippets.
By specifying this variable, you can set the activation key to be used to register the system.
dont_register::
If specified, the registration will be skipped.
allow_config_actions::
If set to ``1``, it will allow traditional configuration management (traditional only).
allow_remote_commands::
If set to ``1``, it will allow traditional remote command execution (traditional only).
dont_disable_automatic_onlineupdate::
If set, the automatic online update will stay enabled (SUSE OSes only).
dont_disable_local_repos::
If set, local repositories will stay active (not recommended).

Navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Autoinstallation Snippets] to see which snippets are available.
For more information, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-snippets.adoc[].
