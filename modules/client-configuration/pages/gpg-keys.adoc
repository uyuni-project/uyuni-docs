= Using GPG Keys

{productname} uses GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages installed on clients.
In many cases, you will not need to adjust the GPG settings to be able to install software on your clients.

Lists keys and certificates available for inclusion in {kickstart} profiles and provides a means to create new ones.

This is especially important for customers of {productname} or the Proxy Server because systems kickstarted by them must have the server key imported into {productname} and associated with the relevant {kickstart} profiles.

Import a profile by creating a new key on this page and then make the profile association in the [guimenu]``GPG and SSL keys`` subtab of the [guimenu]``Autoinstallation Details`` page.

To create a key or certificate, click the [guimenu]``Create Stored Key/Cert`` link in the upper-right corner of the page.
Enter a description, select the type, upload the file, and click the btn:[Update Key] button.
A unique description is required.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The GPG key you upload to {productname} must be in ASCII format.
Using a GPG key in binary format causes anaconda, and therefore the {kickstart} process, to fail.
