== Prepare Systems for Configuration Management [Management]

To manage traditional client configuration with {productname}, the client must have the appropriate tools and the [path]``config-enable`` file installed.
These tools will be available if you installed the system with the configuration management functionality using {ay} or Kickstart.
If not, they can be found in the Tools child channel for your distribution.
Download and install the latest [path]``mgr-cfg*`` packages:

* [path]``mgr-cfg`` -- the base libraries and functions needed by all [path]``mgr-cfg-*`` packages,
* [path]``mgr-cfg-actions`` -- the RPM package required to run configuration actions scheduled via {productname},
* [path]``mgr-cfg-client`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface to the client features of the Configuration Management system,
* [path]``mgr-cfg-management`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface used to manage {productname} configuration.


Installation of these packages can also be accomplished during bootstrapping if you enable [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` on the [guimenu]``Details`` page of the activation key after creating that activation key.
For more information about activation keys, see
xref:reference:systems/activation-keys.adoc#s3-sm-system-keys-manage[].



== Create Configuration Channels

To create a new central configuration channel:

[[proc.config.channels.create.cfgch]]
.Procedure: Creating Central Configuration Channel
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels], and click btn:[Create Config Channel].
. Enter a name for the channel.
. Enter a label for the channel. This field must contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (``-``) and underscores (``_``).
. Enter a mandatory description for the channel that allows you to distinguish it from other channels.
. Click the btn:[Create Config Channel] button to create the new channel.
. The following page is a subset of the [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page and has three tabs: [guimenu]``Overview`` , [guimenu]``Add Files`` , and [guimenu]``Systems`` . The [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page is discussed in <<config-config-channels-channel-details>>.

To create a new state channel with an [path]``init.sls`` file:

[[proc.config.channels.create.statech]]
.Procedure: Creating State Channel [Salt]
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels], and click btn:[Create State Channel].
. Enter a name for the channel.
. Enter a label for the channel. This field must contain only letters, numbers, hyphens (``-``) and underscores (``_``).
. Enter a mandatory description for the channel that allows you to distinguish it from other channels.
. Enter the [guimenu]``SLS Contents`` for the [path]``init.sls`` file.
. Click the btn:[Create Config Channel] button to create the new channel.
. The following page is a subset of the [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page and has four tabs: [guimenu]``Overview``, [guimenu]``List/Remove Files``, [guimenu]``Add Files``, and [guimenu]``Systems``. The [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page is discussed in <<config-config-channels-channel-details>>.



== Add Configuration Files, Directories, or Symbolic Links

After you have created a configuration channel you can add a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link:

.Procedure: Adding a Configuration File, Directory, or Symbolic Link
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels], and click the name of the configuration channel where you want to add a configuration file.
. Navigate to menu:Add Files[Create File] subtab, and in the [guimenu]``File Type`` section choose whether you want to create a text file, directory, or symbolic link.
. In the [path]``Filename/Path`` text box, set the absolute path to where the file should be deployed.
. If you are creating a symbolic link, indicate the target file and path in the [guimenu]``Symbolic Link Target Filename/Path`` text box.
. Enter the [guimenu]``User name`` and [guimenu]``Group name`` for the file in the [guimenu]``Ownership`` section, and the [guimenu]``File Permissions Mode``.
. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
. If the configuration file includes a macro, enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
. Enter the configuration file content in the [guimenu]``File Contents`` text box, using the script drop-down box to choose the appropriate scripting language.
. Confirm with clicking the btn:[Create Configuration File] button.
