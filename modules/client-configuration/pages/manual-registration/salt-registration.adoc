There are three possible methods for registering Salt minions.
You can use a bootstrap repository, a bootstrap script, or install using the {webui}.

This section describes using a bootstrap repository.
Registering Salt clients with a bootstrap client is the same as registering traditional clients, which is described at xref:quickstart3_chap_suma_keys_and_first_client.adoc#registering.clients.traditional[Registering Traditional Clients]. When using this method, ensure you enable the [guimenu]``Bootstrap using Salt`` and activation key options in [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment``, so that highstate is applied automatically.
For information on using the {webui}, see xref:reference-webui-systems.adoc#ref.webui.systems.bootstrapping[Bootstrapping Salt].

You can also use these methods to change existing traditional clients into Salt minions.

[IMPORTANT]
.GPG Keys and Uyuni Client Tools
====
The GPG key used by Uyuni Client Tools is not trusted by default.
Either update your bootstrap repository to trust the key explicitly, or use the {webui} to manually trust the key from each client.
====


To register Salt clients with a bootstrap repository, you will need to have already set up a {susemgr} tools repository, which is described in xref:quickstart3_chap_suma_keys_and_first_client.adoc#create.tools.repository[Create Tools Repository].
You will also need to have fully synchronized a base channel for clients to obtain software packages (for example: `SLES12-SP4-Pool_for_x86_64`).


.Procedure: Registering Salt Minions
. On your minion as {rootuser} enter the following command:
+

----
zypper ar http://FQDN.server.example.com/pub/repositories/sle/12/4/bootstrap/ \
   sles12-sp4
----
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not use ``HTTPS``.
Use `HTTP` instead to avoid errors.
====
+

. After adding the repository containing the necessary Salt packages execute:
+

----
zypper in salt-minion
----
. Modify the minion configuration file to point to the fully qualified domain name ([replaceable]``FQDN``) of the {productname} server (master):
+

----
vi /etc/salt/minion
----
+
Find and change the line:
+

----
master: salt
----
+
to:
+

----
master: FQDN.server.example.com
----
. Restart the Salt minion with:
+

----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----

Your newly registered minion should now show up within the {webui} under menu:Salt[Keys].
Accept the [guimenu]``pending`` key to begin management.

If you have used your hypervisor clone utility, and attempted to register the cloned Salt client, you might get this error:

----
We're sorry, but the system could not be found.
----

This is caused by the new, cloned, system having the same machine ID as an existing, registered, system.
You can adjust this manually to correct the error and register the cloned system successfully.
