[[contact-methods-salt]]
= Default Contact Method ({salt})

The default contact method using the {salt} protocol is recommended unless there are specific needs.
For more information about {salt} in general, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-overview.adoc[].

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
The {salt} Contact Method is the best scaling method.
All new {productname} features are supported.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The so-called traditional contact method is no longer supported with {productname} 5.0 and later.
Before upgrading from {productname} 4 to 5, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to {salt} or replaced with {salt} proxies.

Software updates are generally pushed from the server to the client.
Connections are initiated from the client.
This means you must open ports on the server, not on clients.
The {salt} clients are also known as {salt} minions.
{productname} Server installs a daemon on every client.

If you need to use {salt} clients in a disconnected setup you can configure SSH Push as a contact method.
With this contact method, clients can be located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
For more information about SSH Push, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltssh.adoc[].



[[onboarding-details]]
== Onboarding Details

{salt} has its own database to keep the keys for the minions. This needs to be kept in sync with the {productname} database.
As soon as the key is accepted in {salt}, the onboarding process in {productname} starts.

The onboarding process will look for existing systems in the {productname} database by searching for the ``minion_id`` and the ``machine-id``.
Depending on the outcome, the following scenarios are possible:

* If nothing is found, the new system gets created.
* In case an entry with the ``minion_id`` or the ``machine-id`` is found, that system will be migrated to match the new system.
* In case there is a match for both entries, and they are not the same system, the onboarding will be aborted with an error.
* In this case the administrator needs to resolve the conflict by removing at least one of the systems.
