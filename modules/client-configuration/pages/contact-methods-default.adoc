[[contact-methods-salt]]
= Default Contact Method ({salt})

The default contact method using the {salt} protocol is recommended unless there are specific needs.
For more information about {salt} in general, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-overview.adoc[].

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
The {salt} Contact Method is the best scaling method.
All new {productname} features are supported.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The so-called traditional contact protocol is no longer supported with {productname} 5.0 and later.
Before upgrading from {productname} 4 to 5, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to {salt} or replaced with {salt} proxies.

For more information about migrating traditional {productname} 4 clients to {salt} clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html

Software updates are generally pushed from the server to the client.
Connections are initiated from the client.
This means you must open ports on the server, not on clients.
The {salt} clients are also known as {salt} minions.
{productname} Server installs a daemon on every client.

If you need to use {salt} clients in a disconnected setup you can configure SSH Push as a contact method.
With this contact method, clients can be located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
For more information about SSH Push, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltssh.adoc[].



[[onboarding-details]]
== Onboarding Details

{salt} has its own database to keep the keys for the minions. This needs to be kept in sync with the {productname} database.
As soon as the key is accepted in {salt}, the onboarding process in {productname} starts.

The onboarding process will look for existing systems in the {productname} database by searching for the ``minion_id`` and the ``machine-id``.
Depending on the outcome, the following scenarios are possible:

* If nothing is found, the new system gets created.
* In case an entry with the ``minion_id`` or the ``machine-id`` is found, that system will be migrated to match the new system.
* In case there is a match for both entries, and they are not the same system, the onboarding will be aborted with an error.
* In this case the administrator needs to resolve the conflict by removing at least one of the systems.
