= Software Repositories

Repositories are used to collect software packages.
When you have access to a software repository, you can install any of the software that the repository provides.
You must have at least one repository associated with your software channels in {productname} to assign clients to the channel and install and update packages on the client.

Most default channels in {productname} are already associated with the correct repositories.
If you are creating custom channels, you will need to associate a repository that you have access to, or that you have created yourself.

For more information about custom repositories and channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].



== Local Repository Locations

You can configure local repositories on Salt clients, to provide packages that are not supplied by {productname} channels.

Local repositories are disabled during onboarding.
After a client has completed onboarding, you can add local repositories to these locations:

.Local Repository Locations
|===
| Client Operating System | Local Repository Directory
| {sles} | [path]``/etc/zypp/repos.d``
| {opensuse} | [path]``/etc/zypp/repos.d``
| {sles} {es} | [path]``/etc/yum.repos.d/``
| {rhel} | [path]``/etc/yum.repos.d/``
| {centos} | [path]``/etc/yum.repos.d/``
| {ubuntu} | [path]``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/``
| {debian} | [path]``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/``

For Salt clients, local repositories remain persistent, even when applying the highstate.
