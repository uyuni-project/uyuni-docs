== Register on the Command Line (Salt)

// Might need an 'unsupported' note? LKB 2019-05-01

Instead of the {webui}, you can use the command line to register a Salt client.
This procedure requires that you have installed the Salt package on the Salt client before registration.
For SLEÂ 12 based clients, you also must have activated the [systemitem]``Advanced Systems Management`` module.

[NOTE]
====
Registring on the command line is also possible with traditional clients, but it requires more steps.
It is not covered here.
Use the bootstrap script procedure to register traditional clients.
For more information, see xref:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

.Procedure: Registering Clients Using the Command Line

. Choose a client configuration file located at:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion
----
+
or:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion.d/NAME.conf
----
+
This is sometimes also called a minion file.
. Add the {productname} Server or Proxy FQDN as the `master`, and the activation key, to the client configuration file:
+
----
master: SERVER.EXAMPLE.COM
server_id_use_src: adler32
enable_legacy_startup_events: False
enable_fqdns_grains: False
grains:
  susemanager:
    activation-key: "<Activation_Key_Name>"
----

. Restart the [systemitem]``salt-minion`` service:
+
----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----
. On the {productname} Server, accept the new client key; replace [systemitem]``<client>`` with the name of your client:
+
----
salt-key -a '<client>'
----

////
REMARK: This is what we previously offered:

.Procedure: Registering Salt Clients
. On your client as {rootuser} enter the following command:
+

----
zypper ar http://FQDN.server.example.com/pub/repositories/sle/12/4/bootstrap/ \
   sles12-sp4
----
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not use ``HTTPS``.
Use `HTTP` instead to avoid errors.
====
+

. After adding the repository containing the necessary Salt packages execute:
+

----
zypper in salt-minion
----
. Modify the client configuration file to point to the fully qualified domain name ([replaceable]``FQDN``) of the {productname} server (master):
+

----
vi /etc/salt/minion
----
+
Find and change the line:
+

----
master: salt
----
+
to:
+

----
master: FQDN.server.example.com
----
. Restart the Salt client with:
+

----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----

Your newly registered client should now show up within the {webui} under menu:Salt[Keys].
Accept the [guimenu]``pending`` key to begin management.

== SLES{nbsp}11 SSL errors

SLES{nbsp}11 clients can sometimes have SSL errors which make some operations unusable, including package management and bootstrapping.
In this case, you will see an error like this:

----
Repository 'SLES11-SP4-SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64' is invalid.
[|] Valid metadata not found at specified URL(s)
Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.
Skipping repository 'SLES11-SP4-SUSE-Manager-Tools x86_64' because of the above error.
Download (curl) error for 'www.example.com':
Error code: Unrecognized error
Error message: error:1409442E:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:tlsv1 alert protocol version
----

This occurs because Apache requires TLS{nbsp}v1.2, but older versions of SLES do not support this version of the TLS protocol.
To fix this error, you need to force Apache to accept a greater range of protocol versions.
Open the [path]``/etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf`` configuration file, locate the [systemitem]``SSLProtocol`` line, and update it to read:

----
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
----

This will need to be done manually on the server, and with a Salt state on the Proxy.
Restart the [systemitem]``apache`` service on each system after making the changes.
