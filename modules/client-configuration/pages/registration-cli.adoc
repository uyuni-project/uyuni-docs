= Register on the Command Line (Salt)

Instead of the {webui}, you can use the command line to register a Salt client.
This procedure requires that you have installed the Salt package on the Salt client before registration.
For SLEÂ 12 based clients, you also must have activated the [systemitem]``Advanced Systems Management`` module.

[NOTE]
====
Registering on the command line is also possible with traditional clients, but it requires more steps.
It is not covered here.
Use the bootstrap script procedure to register traditional clients.
For more information, see xref:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

.Procedure: Registering Clients Using the Command Line

. Choose a client configuration file located at:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion
----
+
or:
+
----
/etc/salt/minion.d/NAME.conf
----
+
This is sometimes also called a minion file.
. Add the {productname} Server or Proxy FQDN as the `master`, and the activation key, to the client configuration file:
+
----
master: SERVER.EXAMPLE.COM
server_id_use_src: adler32
enable_legacy_startup_events: False
enable_fqdns_grains: False
grains:
  susemanager:
    activation_key: "<Activation_Key_Name>"
----

. Restart the [systemitem]``salt-minion`` service:
+
----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----
. On the {productname} Server, accept the new client key; replace [systemitem]``<client>`` with the name of your client:
+
----
salt-key -a '<client>'
----


[WARNING]
====
To register and use {centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, or {sleses}{nbsp}6 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.
For more information about how to resolve this error, see ``Registering Older Clients`` at xref:client-configuration:tshoot-clients.adoc[].

////
REMARK: This is what we previously offered:

.Procedure: Registering Salt Clients
. On your client as {rootuser} enter the following command:
+

----
zypper ar http://FQDN.server.example.com/pub/repositories/sle/12/4/bootstrap/ \
   sles12-sp4
----
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not use ``HTTPS``.
Use `HTTP` instead to avoid errors.
====
+

. After adding the repository containing the necessary Salt packages execute:
+

----
zypper in salt-minion
----
. Modify the client configuration file to point to the fully qualified domain name ([replaceable]``FQDN``) of the {productname} server (master):
+

----
vi /etc/salt/minion
----
+
Find and change the line:
+

----
master: salt
----
+
to:
+

----
master: FQDN.server.example.com
----
. Restart the Salt client with:
+

----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----

Your newly registered client should now show up within the {webui} under menu:Salt[Keys].
Accept the [guimenu]``pending`` key to begin management.
