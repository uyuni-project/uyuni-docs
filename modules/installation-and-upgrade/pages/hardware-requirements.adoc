[[server-hardware-requirements]]
== Server Requirements

By default the {productname} Server container stores packages in the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory.
Repository synchronization fails if this directory runs out of disk space.
Estimate how much space the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory requires based on the clients and repositories you plan to mirror.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname} performance depends on hardware resources, network bandwidth, latency between clients and server, etc.

Based on the experience and different deployments that are in use, the advice for optimal performance of {productname} Server with an adequate number of proxies is to not exceed 10,000 clients per single server.
It is highly recommended to move to the Hub setup and involve consultancy when you have more than 10,000 clients.
Even with fine-tuning and an adequate number of proxies, such a large number of clients can lead to performance issues.

For more information about managing a large number of clients, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-multi-server.adoc[].

| Minimum 100 GB

|===


By default the {productname} Proxy container caches packages in the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory.
If there is not enough space available in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/``, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages.

As a result of this behavior:

* The larger [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory is on the proxy, the less traffic there will be between it and the {productname} Server.
* By making the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory on the proxy the same size as [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` on the {productname} Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization.
* The [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory can be small on the {productname} Server compared to the proxy.
    For a guide to size estimation, see the <<server-hardware-requirements>> section.



[[installation-postgresql-requirements]]
== Database Requirement

{postgresql} is the only supported database.
Using a remote {postgresql} database or remote file systems (such as NFS) with the {postgresql} database is not supported.
In other words, {postgresql} should be on the fastest available storage device for {productname}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because of potential performance issues, running a {postgresql} database remotely from {productname} is discouraged.
While such an environment is possible and even stable in many cases, there is always a risk of data loss if something goes wrong.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
{suse} might not be able to provide assistance in such cases.

== Estimating Disk Space for your Environment

There are three directories that should be considered in an estimated disk space calculation.

These are:

* var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk
* var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql
* var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache

To estimate the disk space required for these directories, particularly when dealing with clients and repositories in a {productname} server, consider the following factors:

Number of Clients:: The space needed depends on the number of clients you plan to manage. 
Each client might require specific packages and updates that need to be stored locally.

Size and Number of Repositories:: The repositories you choose to mirror will significantly impact disk space usage. 
Larger repositories or those with frequent updates will require more space.

Package Sizes:: Different packages have varying sizes. 
Averages can be skewed by a few large packages, so consider both the average and the range of package sizes in your repositories.

Data Retention Policy:: How long you retain old packages, logs, and other data affects space requirements. 
More extended retention equals more space needed.

Overhead for System Operation:: Include extra space for logs, database growth, temporary files, and system overhead.

.Procedure: Steps to Estimate Space Requirements:
. List Repositories: Determine which repositories you plan to mirror. Check their current sizes on the source servers.
. Calculate Per-client Space: If different clients require unique sets of packages, calculate the average space needed per client.
. Aggregate Repository Sizes: Add up the total size of all repositories you intend to mirror.
. Add Overhead and Growth: Factor in additional space for system overhead, growth, and unforeseen needs (typically an additional 10-20%).
. Sum Up: Combine the space for all elements to get a total estimate.
+


Example Calculation:: Suppose you plan to mirror 3 repositories:

* Repo 1: 50 GB
* Repo 2: 75 GB
* Repo 3: 100 GB
+

Assume 50 clients, each needing an average of 1 GB for unique packages.
System overhead and growth:: 20%

Calculate as follows::

* Total repository size = **50 GB + 75 GB + 100 GB** = **225 GB**
* Client-specific space = **50 clients * 1 GB** = **50 GB**
* Total required = **(225 GB + 50 GB) * 120%** = **330 GB**

Thus, you should plan for at least 330 GB of disk space for these directories to accommodate the mirrored repositories, client packages, and system overhead. Adjust these numbers based on your specific needs and data retention policies.


== Persistent Storage and Permissions

Persistent volumes are created by default when deploying the container.

However, it is recommended that the repositories and the database for {productname} are stored on separate storage devices.
Such a setup helps avoid data loss in production environments.

Storage devices must be setup prior to deploying the container.
For more details see: xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[Persistent Container Volumes]

{productname} requires three different volumes:

* Database volume: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql``
* Channel volume: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``
* Cache: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache``

We recommend you use XFS as the filesystem type for all volumes.
Additionally, for on-premise installations, consider using logical volume management (LVM) to manage the disks.
The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with {productname}.
See the tables in this section for guides to estimate the size required.

On your {productname} Server, use this command to find all available storage devices:

----
hwinfo --disk | grep -E "Device File:"
----

Use the [command]``lsblk`` command to see the name and size of each device.

Use the [command]``suma-storage`` command with the device names to set up the external disks as the locations for the database and repositories:

----
suma-storage <channel_devicename> [<database_devicename>]
----

The external storage volumes are set up as XFS partitions mounted at [path]``/manager_storage`` and [path]``/pgsql_storage``.

It is possible to use the same storage device for both channel data and the database.
This is not recommended, as growing channel repositories might fill up the storage, which poses a risk to database integrity.
Using separate storage devices may also increase performance.
If you want to use a single storage device, run [command]``suma-storage`` with a single device name parameter.

If you are installing a proxy, the [command]``suma-storage`` command only takes a single device name parameter and will set up the external storage location as the Squid cache.

When you create disk partitions for the {productname} Server and Proxy, ensure you set the permissions correctly.

For [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql``:

* Owner: Read, Write, Execute
* Group: Read, Execute
* User: None

For [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``:

* Owner: Read, Write, Execute
* Group: Read, Write, Execute
* User: Read, Execute

Check the permissions with this command:

----
ls -l /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk
----

The output should look like this:

----
/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql:
total 0
drwxr-x--- 1 10556 10556 48 Apr 19 14:33 _data

/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 10552 root 30 Apr 19 14:34 _data

----

If required, change the permissions with these commands:

----
chmod 750 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql
chmod 775 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk
----

And owners with:

----
chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql
chown wwwrun:www /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk
----
