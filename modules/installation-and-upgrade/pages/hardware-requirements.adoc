== Server Hardware Requirements

By default the {productname} Server container stores packages in the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory.
Repository synchronization fails if this directory runs out of disk space.
You can estimate how much space the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory requires based on the clients and repositories you plan to mirror.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname} performance depends on hardware resources, network bandwidth, latency between clients and server, etc.

Based on the experience and different deployments that are in use, the advice for optimal performance of {productname} Server with an adequate number of proxies is to not exceed 10,000 clients per single server.
It is highly recommended to move to the Hub setup and involve consultancy when you have more than 10,000 clients.
Even with fine-tuning and an adequate number of proxies, such a large number of clients can lead to performance issues.

For more information about managing a large number of clients, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-multi-server.adoc[].

By default the {productname} Proxy container caches packages in the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory.
If there is not enough space available in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/``, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages.

As a result of this behavior:

* The larger [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory is on the proxy, the less traffic there will be between it and the {productname} Server.
* By making the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory on the proxy the same size as [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` on the {productname} Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization.
* The [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/`` directory can be small on the {productname} Server compared to the proxy.
    For a guide to size estimation, see the <<server-hardware-requirements>> section.



== Storage Devices and Permissions

Persistent volumes are created by default when deploying the container. 
However it is recommended that the repositories and the database for {productname} are stored on separate storage devices.
This will help to avoid data loss.
You must set up the storage devices prior to deploying the container.
For more details see: xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[Persistent Container Volumes]

{productname} requires three different volumes:

* Database volume: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql``
* Channel volume: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``
* Cache: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache``

We recommend you use XFS as the filesystem type for all volumes.
Additionally, for on-premise installations, consider using logical volume management (LVM) to manage the disks.
The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with {productname}.
See the tables in this section for guides to estimate the size required.

On your {productname} Server, use this command to find all available storage devices:

----
hwinfo --disk | grep -E "Device File:"
----

Use the [command]``lsblk`` command to see the name and size of each device.

Use the [command]``suma-storage`` command with the device names to set up the external disks as the locations for the database and repositories:

----
suma-storage <channel_devicename> [<database_devicename>]
----

The external storage volumes are set up as XFS partitions mounted at [path]``/manager_storage`` and [path]``/pgsql_storage``.

It is possible to use the same storage device for both channel data and the database.
This is not recommended, as growing channel repositories might fill up the storage, which poses a risk to database integrity.
Using separate storage devices may also increase performance.
If you want to use a single storage device, run [command]``suma-storage`` with a single device name parameter.

If you are installing a proxy, the [command]``suma-storage`` command only takes a single device name parameter and will set up the external storage location as the Squid cache.

When you create disk partitions for the {productname} Server and Proxy, ensure you set the permissions correctly.

For [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql``:

* Owner: Read, Write, Execute
* Group: Read, Execute
* User: None

For [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``:

* Owner: Read, Write, Execute
* Group: Read, Write, Execute
* User: Read, Execute

Check the permissions with this command:

----
ls -l /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk
----

The output should look like this:

----
/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql:
total 0
drwxr-x--- 1 10556 10556 48 Apr 19 14:33 _data

/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk:
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 10552 root 30 Apr 19 14:34 _data

----

If required, change the permissions with these commands:

----
chmod 750 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql
chmod 775 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk
----

And owners with:

----
chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql
chown wwwrun:www /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk
----
