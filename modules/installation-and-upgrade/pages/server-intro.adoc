Major Version Upgrade (X Upgrade)::
Major upgrade is usually an upgrade from X.Y to X+1.0 or to X+1.1, where Y is the latest minor version of the X series.
For example:

* From version 3.2 to 4.0 or to 4.1 (upgrading directly from 3.2 to 4.2 or later is not supported).

* See xref:installation-and-upgrade:server-x.adoc[].

Minor Version Upgrade (Y Upgrade)::
Minor upgrade refers to upgrading to the next minor version, from X.Y to X.Y+1.
This is often referred to as a product migration, service pack migration, or SP migration.
For example:

* From 4.2 to 4.3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You always upgrade from and to the latest patch level of the minor version.

For example, from 4.2.12 to 4.3.8, or later.

Patch Level Upgrade (Z Upgrade)::
Upgrading within the same minor version.
This is often referred to as a maintenance update or MU.
