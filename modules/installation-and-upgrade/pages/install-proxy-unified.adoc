{productname} Proxy is the {productname} component that caches software packages on an internal server.
The proxy also caches patch updates from {suse} or custom RPMs generated by third-party organizations.
A proxy allows you to use bandwidth more effectively because client systems connect to the proxy for updates, and the {productname} server is no longer required to handle all client requests.
The proxy also supports transparent custom package deployment.

{productname} Proxy is an open source (GPLv2) solution that provides the following features:

* Cache software packages within a Squid proxy.
* Client systems see the {susemgrproxy} as the {productname} server instance.
* The {susemgrproxy} is registered as a client system with the {productname} server.

The primary goal of a {susemgrproxy} is to improve {productname} performance by reducing bandwidth requirements and accelerating response time.
