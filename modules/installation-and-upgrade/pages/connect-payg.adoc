= Connect {payg} instance

In the three major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure), SUSE:

* provides customized {payg} product images for SLES, SLES for SAP, etc.
* operates per-region RMT Servers mirroring repositories for products available as {payg}

This document describes how to connect existing {payg} instance to {productname} server, and gives basic information about credentials collection from the instance.
The goal of this connection is to extract authentication data so the {productname} Server can connect to a cloud RMT host. 
Then the {productname} Server has access to products on the RMT host that are not already available with the {scc} organization credentials.


Before using {payg} feature make sure that: 

* The {payg} instance is launched from the correct SUSE product image (for example, SLES, SLES for SAP, or SLE HPC) to allow access to the desired repositories

* {productname} Server has connectivity to the {payg} instance (ideally in the same region) either directly or via a bastion

* A basic {scc} account is required. Enter your valid {scc} credentials in menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Organization Credentials]. This account is required for accessing the {productname} client tools for boostrapping regardless of {payg} instances.

* If you bootstrap the {payg} instance to SUSE Manager, SUSE Manager will disable its {payg} repositories then add repositories from where it mirrored the data from the RMT server. The final result will be {payg} instances acquiring the same repositories from the RMT servers but through the SUSE Manager server itself. Of course repositories can still be setup primarily from SCC.



== Connecting {payg} instance

[[proc-connecting-new-payg]]
.Procedure: Connecting new {payg} instance
[role=procedure]
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate  to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > {payg}], and click btn:[Add {payg}].
. Start with the page section [guimenu]``{payg} connection Description``.
. In the [guimenu]``Description`` field, add the description.
. Move to the page section [guimenu]``Instance SSH connection data``.
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, enter the instance DNS or IP address to connect from {productname}.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, enter the port number or use default value 22.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, enter the username as specified in the cloud.
. In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, enter the password.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key`` field, enter the instance key.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key Passphrase`` field, enter the key passphrase.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Authentication keys must always be in PEM format.
====

If you are not connecting directly to the instance, but via SSH bastion, proceed with <<proc-adding-ssh-bastion-connection-data>>.

Otherwise, continue with <<proc-finishing-payg-connecting>>.

[[proc-adding-ssh-bastion-connection-data]]
.Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data
[role=procedure]
. Navigate to the page section [guimenu]``Bastion SSH connection data``.
. In the [guimenu]``Host`` field, enter the bastion hostname.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Port`` field, enter the bastion port number.
. In the [guimenu]``User`` field, enter the bastion username.
. In the [guimenu]``Password`` field, enter the bastion password.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key`` field, enter the bastion key.
. In the [guimenu]``SSH Private Key Passphrase`` field, enter the bastion key passphrase.

Complete the setup process with with <<proc-finishing-payg-connecting>>.

[[proc-finishing-payg-connecting]]
.Procedure: Finishing {payg} connecting
[role=procedure]
. To complete adding new {payg} connection data, click btn:[Create].
. Return to {payg} connection data [guimenu]``Details`` page. 
    The updated connection status is displayed on the top section named [guimenu]``Information``.
. Connection status is shown in [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go`` screen too.
. If the authentication data for the instance are correct, the column [guimenu]``Status`` shows "Credentials successfully updated."

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the invalid data are entered at any point, the newly created instance is shown in [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > {payg}``, with column [guimenu]``Status`` displaying error message.
====


As soon as the authentication data is available on the server, the list of available products is updated.

Available products are all versions of the same product family and architecture as the one installed in the {payg} instance. 
For example, if the instance has the {slsa}{nbsp}15 SP1 product installed, {slsa}{nbsp}15 SP2 and {slsa}{nbsp}15 SP3 are automatically shown in [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > Products``. 

Once the products are shown as available, the user can add a product to {productname} by selecting the checkbox next to the product name and clicking btn:[Add product].

After the success message you can verify the newly added channels in the {webui}, by navigating to [guimenu]``Software > Channel List > All``. 

To monitor the syncing progress of each channel, check the log files in the [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync`` directory on the {productname} Server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a product is provided by both the {payg} instance and one of the {scc} subscriptions, it will appear only once in the products list.

When the channels belonging to that product are synced, the data might still come from the SCC subscription, and not from the Pay-As-You-Go instance.
====


=== Deleting the instance connection data

The following procedure describes how to delete SSH connection data of the instance.

[[proc-deleting-connection-data-to-instance]]
.Procedure: Deleting connection data to instance
[role=procedure]
. Open [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > {payg}``.
. Find the instance on the list of existing instances.
. Click on the instance details.
. Select btn:[Delete] and confirm your selection.
. You are returned to the list of instances. 
    The one that was just deleted is no longer shown.



== Instance credential collect status

{productname} server uses credentails collected from the instance to connect to the RMT server and to download the packages using reposync.
These credentials are refreshed every 10 minutes by taskomatic using the defined SSH connection data. Connection to RMT server always uses the last known authentication credentials collected from the {payg} instance.

The status of the {payg} instance credentials collect is shown in the column [literal]``Status`` or on the instance details page.
When the instance is not reachable, the credential update process will fail.

{payg} instance remains connected to {productname} server unless SSH connection data is explicitly deleted.
To delete the SSH connection data to the instance, use <<proc-deleting-connection-data-to-instance>>. 
 

{payg} instance may not be accessible from the {productname} server at all times.

* If the instance exists, but is stopped, the last known credentials will be used to try to connect to the instance. 
    How long the credentials remain valid depends on the cloud provider.

* If the instance no longer exists, but is still registered with SUMA, its credentials are no longer valid and the authentication will fail.
    The error message is shown in the column Status. 
+
[WARNING]
====
The error message only indicates that the instance is not available. 
Further diagnostics about the status of the instance needs to be done on the cloud provider. 
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Any of the following actions or changes in the {payg} instance will lead to credentials failing:
* removing zypper credentials files
* removing the imported certificates
* removing cloud-specific entries from [path]``/etc/hosts``
====


== Registering {payg} system as a client

You can register a {payg} instance from where you harvest the credentials as a {salt} client.
The instance needs to have a valid cloud connection registered, otherwise it will not have access to channels.
If the user removes the cloud packages, the credentials harvesting may stop working.

First set up the {payg} instance to collect authentication data, so it can synchronize the channels.

The rest of the process is the same as for any non-public-cloud client and consists of synchronizing channels, automatic bootstrap script creation, activation key creation and starting the registration.

For more about registering clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].


== Troubleshooting 

Checking the credentials::
* If the script fails to collect the credentials, it should provide a proper error message in the logs and in the {webui}.
* If the credentials are not working, [literal]``reposync`` should show the proper error.

Using [literal]``registercloudguest``::
* Refreshing or changing the [literal]``registercloudguest`` connection to the public cloud update infrastructure should not interfere with the credentials usage.
* Running [literal]```registercloudguest --clean`` will cause problems if no new cloud connection is registered with the cloud guest command.
