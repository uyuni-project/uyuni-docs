{productname} Proxy caches packages in the [path]``/var/cache/`` directory.
If there is not enough space available in [path]``/var/cache/``, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages.

As a result of this behavior:

* The larger [path]``/var/cache/`` directory is on the proxy, the less traffic there will be between it and the {productname} Server.

* By making the [path]``/var/cache/`` directory on the proxy the same size as [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` on the {productname} Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization.

* The [path]``/var/cache/`` directory can be small on the {productname} Server compared to the proxy.
    For a guide to size estimation, see the <<server-hardware-requirements>> section.
