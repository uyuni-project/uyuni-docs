| Recommendation

| openSUSE Leap 15.4
| Clean installation, up-to-date
| openSUSE Leap 15.4

| CPU
|
| Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores

| RAM

| Minimum 2{nbsp}GB

|
| Production Server
| Minimum 8{nbsp}GB

| Disk Space
| [path]``/`` (root directory)
| Minimum 40{nbsp}GB

{productname} Proxy caches packages in the [path]``/var/cache/`` directory.
If there is not enough space available in [path]``/var/cache/``, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages.

As a result of this behavior:

* The larger [path]``/var/cache/`` directory is on the proxy, the less traffic there will be between it and the {productname} Server.
* By making the [path]``/var/cache/`` directory on the proxy the same size as [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` on the {productname} Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization.
* The [path]``/var/cache/`` directory can be small on the {productname} Server compared to the proxy.
    For a guide to size estimation, see the <<server-hardware-requirements>> section.



////
[NOTE]
====
Storage size values are the absolute minimum—only suitable for a small test or demo installation.
Especially [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` may quickly need more space.
Also consider to create a separate partition for [path]``/srv`` where Kiwi images are stored.
