= SUSE Manager Proxy Registration

// needs to be updated for container use

{productname} Proxy systems are installed with the {unifiedinstaller} and registered to {productname} using bootstrap script or {webui}.
// For more information about installing proxies, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-proxy-unified.adoc[].

After the client is succesfully bootstrapped, it needs to be configured as {productname} Proxy.

This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy as the {productname} client, using an activation key.

.Procedure: Registering the Proxy
. Create an activation key based on the [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SUSE-Manager-Proxy-4.3-Pool`` base channel.
    For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have completely downloaded the {productname} Proxy {productnumber} channel and all the recommended and mandatory {sle} {sles-version} {sp-base} channels.
====

. From the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` listing select the recommended channels by clicking the ``include recommended`` icon:
+
* SLE-Module-Basesystem15-{sp-base}-Pool
* SLE-Module-Basesystem15-{sp-base}-Updates
* SLE-Module-Server-Applications15-{sp-base}-Pool
* SLE-Module-Server-Applications15-{sp-base}-Updates
* SLE-Module-SUSE-Manager-Proxy-4.3-Pool
* SLE-Module-SUSE-Manager-Proxy-4.3-Updates
+
The [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SUSE-Manager-Proxy-4.3-Updates`` channel is mandatory.
+
. To bootstrap a proxy, use the bootstrap script.
    For more information about bootstrap scripts, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
+
. Alternatively, in the SUSE Manager Web UI, navigate to menu:System[Bootstrapping].
+
. Navigate to menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels], and check that the four proxy channels ([systemitem]``Pool`` and [systemitem]``Updates`` for [systemitem]``SLE-PRODUCT`` and [systemitem]``SLE-MODULE``) plus the recommended channels are selected.
    [systemitem]``SLE-PRODUCT-Pool`` must be the base channel and the others are child channels.
