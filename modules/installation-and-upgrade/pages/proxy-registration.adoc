[[proxy-register]]
= SUSE Manager Proxy Registration

{productname} Proxy systems are Salt or traditional clients that are installed with the {unifiedinstaller} and registered to {productname} using bootstrap script or GUI.

For more information about installing proxies, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-proxy-unified.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Migrating a traditional proxy to a Salt proxy is not possible.
If you want to change a traditional proxy to a Salt proxy, you need to reinstall the proxy.
For more information about reinstalling proxies, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:proxy-setup.adoc[].
====

After the Salt client is succesfully bootstrapped, it needs to be configured as {productname} Proxy.

This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy as the {productname} client, using an activation key.


//[IMPORTANT]
//====
//When choosing a username or password for your {productname} Proxy, ensure it does not contain an ``@`` or ``:`` character.
//These characters are reserved.
//====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have completely downloaded the {productname} Proxy {productnumber} channel and all the recommended and mandatory {sle} {sles-version} {sp-version} channels.
