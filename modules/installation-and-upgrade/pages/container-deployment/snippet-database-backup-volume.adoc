Server migration or upgrade with [command]``mgradm migration`` or [command]``mgradm upgrade`` can create a volume with the database backup.

When the {postgresql} database version is increased, the old database must be stored in a separate location before running the upgrade.
For this purpose [command]``mgradm`` dynamically creates the volume [path]``var-pgsql-backup``.
When the migration or upgrade is done and the user has validated that the new system is working as expected, this volume can be removed safely.
