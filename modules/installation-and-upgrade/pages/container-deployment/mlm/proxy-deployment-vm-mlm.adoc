= {productname} Proxy Deployment as a Virtual Machine - KVM
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
:noindex:
endif::[]

This chapter provides the Virtual Machine settings for deployment of {productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an image.
KVM will be combined with Virtual Machine Manager (_virt-manager_) as a sandbox for this installation.



// FIXME: make this section a snippet or move it to a general intro for both,
//        KVM and VMware
== Available Images

[IMPORTANT]
====
The preferred method for deploying {productnumber} Proxy is to use one of the following available images.
All tools are included in these images simplifying deployment.
====

// 2025-02-17, ke: as of today, suse-manager directory is still in use
Images for {productname} {productnumber} Proxy are available at link:https://www.suse.com/download/suse-manager/[{productname} {productnumber} VM images].

== Virtual Machine Manager (virt-manager) Settings

Enter the following settings when creating a new virtual machine using *virt-manager*.

[NOTE]
====
This table specifies the minimum requirements.
These are suitable for a quick test installation, such as a server with one client.
If you want to use a production environment and need background information about disk space, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

[[proxy-minimmal.kvm.setup]]
== Initial KVM Setup

.Procedure: Creating Initial Setup
. Create a new virtual machine using the downloaded {minimal} KVM image and select [guimenu]``Import existing disk image``.
. Configure RAM and number of CPUs (at least 16 GB RAM and 4 CPUs).
. Name your KVM machine and select the [guimenu]``Customize configuration before install`` check box.
. Click btn:[Begin Installation] to boot from the image.
. At the JeOS Firstboot screen select start to continue.

== Install container services on the host system
ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]

[NOTE]
====
[literal]``Containers Module`` is required to be available for container host on a {sles} machine.

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

First step is to install the [literal]``mgrpxy`` utility provided by the package of the same name.

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]
The [literal]``mgrpxy`` package is available in the {productname} Proxy product repositories.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
The [literal]``mgrpxy`` package is available in the container utils repository: pick the one matching the distribution in: https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/.
endif::[]

To install them run:

----
zypper in helm mgrpxy
----

=== Using a Custom Container Image for a Service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with [literal]``-tag`` and [literal]``-image``.

For example, use it like this:

----
mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds`` is the image to use and [literal]``0.1.0`` is the version tag, before restarting it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters:

----
mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.
