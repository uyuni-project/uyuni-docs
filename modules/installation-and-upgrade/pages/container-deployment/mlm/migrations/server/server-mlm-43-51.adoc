= {productname} Server Migration to a Containerized Environment

// container host = new server = new server machine with the {productname} {productnumber} Server container(s)
// old server = {productname} 4.3 Server

// We need to figure out which mlm versions prior to the container release can or should be migrated. Something like any version prior to yyyy.mm and later than.


== Requirements and Considerations

=== General

* To migrate a {productname} 4.3 Server to a container, you require a new machine with {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm} and [literal]``mgradm`` installed.

* An in-place migration from {productname} 4.3 to {productnumber} is not supported, regardless of whether the chosen host operating system is {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm}.

* Before migrating from {productname} 4.3 to {productnumber}, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to {salt}.
For more information about migrating traditional {productname} 4.3 clients to {salt} clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html.

* Traditional contact protocol is no longer supported in {productname} 5.0 and later.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This guide only covers the migration from {productname} 4.3 to {productnumber}.
Migrating an existing {productname} {productnumber} instance to the same version while switching the host operating system from {sl-micro} {microversion} to {sles} {bci-mlm}, or vice versa, is not handled by the [command]``mgradm migrate`` command.
====

=== Hostnames

* The current migration procedure does not include functionality for renaming hostnames.
  As a result, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the new server will remain the same as that of the old server.

* The IP address must remain unchanged to ensure that the clients can contact the server.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After the migration, it will be necessary to manually update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server.
====


=== GPG Keys

* Self trusted GPG keys are not migrated.
* GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated.
  Thus synchronizing channels with [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` can fail.
* The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the 4.3 installation to the container host after the actual server migration.
+
.Procedure: Manual Migration of the 4.3 GPG Keys to New Server
. Copy the keys from the 4.3 server to the container host of the new server.
. Later, add each key to the migrated server with the command [command]``mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE>``.

== Migration

===  Prepare {productname} {productnumber} Server Host

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not pre-install {productname} on the prepared {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm} system.

The migration process is designed to perform the server installation automatically.
Running [command]``mgradm install`` and then [command]``mgradm migrate``  is not supported and will lead to an unsupported system state.

In the following steps, we are only preparing the host system, not installing the actual {productname} {productnumber} Server.

[[deploy-sles-host]]
include::../../../prepare-sles-host.adoc[leveloffset=+2]


=== SSH Connection Preparation

This step ensures that the new {productname} {productnumber} Server can connect to the existing 4.3 Server over SSH without requiring a password.
It involves generating and configuring SSH keys, setting up an SSH agent, and copying the public key to the old server.
This setup is required for the migration process to run without manual intervention.

.Procedure: Preparing the SSH Connection
. Ensure that for [systemitem]``root`` an SSH key exists on the new {productnumber} server.
  If a key does not exist, create it with:
+
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa
----
. The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server for a connection to the 4.3 server that does not prompt for a password.
+
----
eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To establish a connection that does not prompt for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server.
If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running [command]``eval $(ssh-agent)``.
Then add the SSH key to the running agent with [command]``ssh-add`` followed by the path to the private key.
You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process.
====

. Copy the public SSH key to the {productname} 4.3 Server ([literal]``<oldserver.fqdn>``) with [command]``ssh-copy-id``.
  Replace [literal]``<oldserver.fqdn>`` with the FQDN of the 4.3 server:
+
----
ssh-copy-id <old server.fqdn>
----
+
The SSH key will be copied into the old server's [path]``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file.
For more information, see the [literal]``ssh-copy-id`` manpage.
+
// . This step is optional:
//   The migration script only uses the 4.3 server's FQDN in the SSH command.
//   This means that every other configuration required to connect, needs to be defined in the [path]``~/.ssh/config`` file.
. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the old {productname} Server to check that no password is needed.
  Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint.
  In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the [path]``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file.
  Then try again.
  The fingerprint will be stored in the local [path]``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file.

=== Perform the Migration

When planning your migration from {productname} 4.3 to {productname} {productnumber}, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the old setup.

This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth.


.Procedure: Performing the Migration
. This step is optional.
  If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the [command]``mgr-storage-server`` tool.
  For more information about [command]``mgr-storage-server``, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#install-hardware-requirements-storage[].

. Execute the following command to install a new {productname} server.
  Replace [literal]``<oldserver.fqdn>`` with the FQDN of the 4.3 server:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to upgrade your 4.3 server and apply all available updates before starting the migration process.
Additionally, remove any unnecessary channels to help reduce the overall migration time.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated.
To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of _initial replication_, _re-replication_, or  _final replication and switch over_ while all the services on the old server can stay up and running.

Only during the final migration the processes on the old server need to be stopped.

For all non-final replications add the parameter [command]``--prepare`` to prevent the automatic stopping the services on the old server.
For example on {productname} server:
----
mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare
----
====

.Procedure: Final Migration
. Stop the {productname} services on 4.3 Server:
+
----
spacewalk-service stop
----
. Stop the PostgreSQL service on 4.3 Server:
+
----
systemctl stop postgresql
----
. Perform the migration on {productname} server
+
----
mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn>
----

. Migrate trusted SSL CA certificates.


==== Migration of the Certificates

Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on {productname} 4.3 in the [path]``/usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/`` directory will not be migrated.
Because {suse} does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the 4.3 installation after the migration.

.Procedure: Migrating the Certificates
. Copy the file from the 4.3 server to the new server.
   For example, as [path]``/local/ca.file``.
. Copy the file into the container with:
+
----
mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
After successfully running the [command]``mgradm migrate`` command, the {salt} setup on all clients will still point to the old 4.3 server.

To redirect them to the {productnumber} server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as 4.3 server.
