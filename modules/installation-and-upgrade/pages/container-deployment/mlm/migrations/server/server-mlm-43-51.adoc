// container host = new server = new server machine with the {productname} {productnumber} Server container(s)
// old server = {productname} 4.3 Server

// We need to figure out which mlm versions prior to the container release can or should be migrated. Something like any version prior to yyyy.mm and later than.


== Requirements and considerations


=== General requirements

* To migrate a {productname} 4.3 Server to a container, you require a new machine with {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm} and [literal]``mgradm`` installed.

* An in-place migration from {productname} 4.3 to {productnumber} is not supported, regardless of whether the chosen host operating system is {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm}.

* Before migrating from {productname} 4.3 to {productnumber}, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to {salt}.
For more information about migrating traditional {productname} 4.3 clients to {salt} clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html[Migrate Traditional Clients to Salt Clients].

* Traditional contact protocol is no longer supported in {productname} 5.0 and later.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This guide only covers the migration from {productname} 4.3 to {productnumber}.

Migrating an existing {productname} {productnumber} instance to the same version while switching the host operating system from {sl-micro} {microversion} to {sles} {bci-mlm}, or vice versa, is not handled by the [command]``mgradm migrate`` command.
====


=== Hostnames

* Current migration procedure does not include functionality for renaming hostnames.
  As a result, fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the new server will remain the same as that of the old server.

* The IP address must remain unchanged to ensure that the clients can contact the server.


[IMPORTANT]
====
After the migration, it is necessary to manually update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server.
====


=== GPG keys

* Self-trusted GPG keys are not migrated.
* GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated.
  Thus, synchronizing channels with [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` can fail.
* The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the 4.3 installation to the container host after the actual server migration.
+
.Procedure: Manual migration of the 4.3 GPG keys to the new server
[role=procedure]
____
. Copy the keys from the 4.3 server to the container host of the new server.

. Later, add each key to the migrated server with the command [command]``mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE>``.
____


=== SSL certificates

During a migration the server SSL certificate and CA chain are copied from the source server, meaning that only the database certificates are required


== Migration

===  Prepare {productname} {productnumber} server host

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not pre-install {productname} on the prepared {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm} system.

The migration process is designed to perform the server installation automatically.
Running [command]``mgradm install`` and then [command]``mgradm migrate``  is not supported and will lead to an unsupported system state.

In the following steps, we are only preparing the host system, not installing the actual {productname} {productnumber} Server.
====

You can use VM images based on {sl-micro} {microversion} as a migration target.
In such a scenario, you can prepare the host system as described in

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-vm-mlm.adoc[] 

+

or

+

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-vmdk-mlm.adoc[].

However, at the end the last step is executing the command [command]``mgradm migrate <FQDN>`` instead
of [command]``mgradm install <FQDN>``.

=== SSH connection preparation

This step ensures that the new {productname} {productnumber} Server can connect to the existing 4.3 Server over SSH without requiring a password.
It involves generating and configuring SSH keys, setting up an SSH agent, and copying the public key to the old server.
This setup is required for the migration process to run without manual intervention.

.Procedure: Preparing the SSH connection
[role=procedure]
____
. Ensure that for [systemitem]``root`` an SSH key exists on the new {productnumber} server.
  If a key does not exist, create it with:

+

----
ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

. The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server for a connection to the 4.3 server that does not prompt for a password.

+

----
eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add
----

+

[NOTE]
====
To establish a connection that does not prompt for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server.
If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running [command]``eval $(ssh-agent)``.
Then add the SSH key to the running agent with [command]``ssh-add`` followed by the path to the private key.
You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process.
====

. Copy the public SSH key to the {productname} 4.3 Server ([literal]``<oldserver.fqdn>``) with [command]``ssh-copy-id``.
  Replace [literal]``<oldserver.fqdn>`` with the FQDN of the 4.3 server:
+
----
ssh-copy-id <old server.fqdn>
----
+
The SSH key will be copied into the old server's [path]``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file.
For more information, see the [literal]``ssh-copy-id`` manpage.
+
// . This step is optional:
//   The migration script only uses the 4.3 server's FQDN in the SSH command.
//   This means that every other configuration required to connect, needs to be defined in the [path]``~/.ssh/config`` file.
. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the old {productname} Server to check that no password is needed.
  Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint.
  In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the [path]``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file.
  Then try again.
  The fingerprint will be stored in the local [path]``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file.

=== Perform the migration

When planning your migration from SUSE Manager 4.3 to {productname} {productnumber}, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the old setup.

This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth.

endif::[]

ifdef::backend-pdf[]
include::../../../../../partials/snippet-hardened-tmpdir.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
endif::[]



[IMPORTANT]
====
When migrating from SUSE Manager 4.3, you will be prompted for the [guimenu]``Password for the CA key to generate``.
It is essential to enter the same CA password that was used in your SUSE Manager 4.3 installation.

Entering the wrong password will result in a failure to generate the database certificate and will cause the migration to abort with the following error:

----
Error: cannot configure db container: Cannot generate database certificate: CA validation failed!
----

Make sure the correct CA password is available before starting the migration process.
====


.Procedure: Performing the migration
[role=procedure]
____
. This step is optional.
  If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the [command]``mgr-storage-server`` tool.
  For more information about [command]``mgr-storage-server``, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#install-hardware-requirements-storage[].

. Execute the following command to migrate and set up a new {productname} {productnumber} server.
  Replace [literal]``<oldserver.fqdn>`` with the FQDN of the 4.3 server:

+

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to upgrade your 4.3 server and apply all available updates before starting the migration process.
Additionally, remove any unnecessary channels to help reduce the overall migration time.
====

+

[NOTE]
====
The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated.
To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of _initial replication_, _re-replication_, or  _final replication and switch over_ while all the services on the old 4.3 server can stay up and running.

Only during the final migration, the processes on the old 4.3 server need to be stopped.

For all non-final replications add the parameter [command]``--prepare`` to prevent the automatic stopping of
services on the old 4.3 server.
====
+ 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Re-running a failed migration creates multiple large backup directories, which accumulate and consume significant space, since each unsuccessful migration creates a new backup directory inside [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.

These backups are not automatically removed by the migration tool.
If a migration fails, you must manually inspect and clean up old backup directories to ensure sufficient space is available for the next attempt. 

Failure to manage this space may result in a failure of the next migration attempt.

After the migration and validation of everything, [path]``var-pgsql-backup`` volume can be removed.
====


+

[WARNING]
====
* The [command]``--prepare`` step can be run multiple times only as long as a final migration has not been started.
* Once the final migration is initiated and reaches the database upgrade stage, you must not run the [command]``--prepare`` command again, as it can lead to data corruption.
====

+

----
mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare
----
____


.Procedure: Final migration
[role=procedure]
____
. Stop the SUSE Manager services on 4.3 Server:

+

----
spacewalk-service stop
----

. Stop the PostgreSQL service on 4.3 Server:

+

----
systemctl stop postgresql
----

. Perform the final migration on {productname} {productnumber} Server

+

----
mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn>
----

. Migrate trusted SSL CA certificates.

____


==== Migration of the certificates

Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on {productname} 4.3 in the [path]``/usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/`` directory will not be migrated.
Because {suse} does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the SUSE Manager 4.3 server after the migration.

.Procedure: Migrating the certificates
[role=procedure]
____
. Copy the file from the SUSE Manager 4.3 Server to the new {productname} {productnumber} Server.
   For example, as [path]``/local/ca.file``.

. Copy the file into the container with:

+

----
mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/
----
____


[IMPORTANT]
====
After successfully running the [command]``mgradm migrate`` command, the {salt} setup on all clients will still point to the old 4.3 server.

To redirect them to the {productnumber} server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as 4.3 server.

Adjusting the IP address can be avoided if the latest version of the minion is installed on the clients, as the newer version can automatically re-connect with the server using only the FQDN.

//----
//mgradm migrate kubernetes <oldserver.fqdn>
//----


== Client tools rebranding

{productname} {productnumber} introduces a rebranded set of client tools for all supported operating systems. 
This transition is seamless, and users performing a new product synchronization should only notice the updated channel names.

Channels named [literal]``SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ``, used by clients previously registered with {productname} 4.3 or 5.0, are no longer available in version 5.1 and will no longer receive updates in 5.1.

Although the legacy channels remain assigned to existing clients after migration, the corresponding repositories have been removed.

To ensure continued updates, users must:

* Mirror the new [literal]``SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Client Tools for XYZ`` channels for the relevant products and assign them to the appropriate clients.

* Unassign the outdated [literal]``SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ`` channels.

This also means that any CLM projects based on the old client tools must be adjusted accordingly.

For example workflow, see xref:common-workflows:workflow-switch-to-new-client-tools-channels.adoc[].
