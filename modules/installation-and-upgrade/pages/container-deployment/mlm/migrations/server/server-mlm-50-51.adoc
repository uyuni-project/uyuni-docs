= Distribution Upgrade and Server Migration


[NOTE]
====
* {productname} 5.0 must be stopped before upgrade.
* {productname} 5.0 is not supported on top of {sl-micro} 6.1 & {sles} 15 SP7 as host os

== {sle-micro} 5.5 to {sl-micro} 6.1


This document provides the tested procedure to upgrade a {sle-micro} 5.5 host deployed with {productname} 5.0 Server to {sl-micro} 6.1 and migrate to {productname} {productnumber}.

=== Prerequisites

* {productname} 5.0 is installed and running on {sle-micro} 5.5.
* System is registered and has active subscriptions with {scc}.

=== Distribution Upgrade and Server Migration

.Procedure: Migration from {productname} 5.0 to {productname} {productnumber}
[role=procedure]
_____

. Verify Current Product Status

+

[source,console]
----
SUSEConnect --status-text
----

+

**Confirm:**

- Base OS: `SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro 5.5`
- Extension: `SUSE Manager Server 5.0 Extension`

+

. Ensure System is Updated

+

[source,console]
----
transactional-update patch
----

+


* If patches were applied, **reboot the system** before proceeding to migration:

[source,console]
----
reboot
----

* If no updates were found, you can proceed directly to the migration step.

+

. Start the Migration:

+

[source,console]
----
transactional-update migration --auto-agree-with-licenses --gpg-auto-import-keys
----

+

Follow the prompts and select the available migration to **SUSE Linux Micro 6.1** and **{productname} Server Extension 5.1**.

+

. Reboot to Apply Changes

+

[source,console]
----
reboot
----

+

. Post-Reboot Checks:

+

Verify upgraded OS and {productname} extension:
+

[source,console]
----
cat /etc/os-release
SUSEConnect --status-text
----

+

You should see:

- `SL-Micro 6.1`
- `Multi-Linux Manager Server Extension 5.1`

+

. Enable Root SSH Access (_if required_).
SL Micro 6.1 disables root login via SSH by default.
Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/sshd.conf`:

+

[source,console]
----
PermitRootLogin yes
----

+

And restart the service:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl restart sshd
----

+

For more information, see xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-remote-root-on-micro.adoc[].

. Upgrade Server Containers

+

[source,console]
----
mgradm upgrade podman
----

+

Follow the prompts to pull and configure the new 5.1.0 containers.


. Check running containers:

+

[source,console]
----
podman ps
----

+

You should see:

- `server:5.1.0`
- `server-postgresql:5.1.0`

+

. Verify {productname} Tools

+

[source,console]
----
mgradm --version
----

+

Expected output:

+

- Version `5.1.11` or later
- References `5.1.0`

[NOTE]
====
* Errors for missing services like `uyuni-db` or `saline` during upgrade can be ignored if not installed previously.
====

=== Migration Complete

The system is now running {productname} 5.1 on SL Micro 6.1.
Continue with post-migration validation.

== {sles} 15 SP6 to 15 SP7

This document provides the tested procedure to upgrade a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 host deployed with SUSE Multi-Linux Manager 5.0 Server to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 with SUSE Multi-Linux Manager 5.1.

=== Prerequisites

* SUSE Multi-Linux Manager 5.0 is installed and running on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6.
* The system is registered and has valid subscriptions in SUSE Customer Center (SCC).
* Ensure backups are created before proceeding.

. Upgrade Server Containers

+

[source,console]
----
mgradm upgrade podman
----

+

Follow prompts to pull the new container images and reconfigure the environment.

+

. Check Running Containers

_____

=== Migration Complete

The system is now successfully upgraded to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 and SUSE Multi-Linux Manager 5.1.
Validate your setup before resuming production operations.

[IMPORTANT]
====

{productname} {productnumber} introduces a rebranded set of client tools for all supported operating systems. This transition is seamless, and users performing a new product synchronization should only notice the updated channel names.

Channels named `SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ`, used by clients previously registered with {productname} 4.3 or 5.0, are no longer available in version 5.1 and will no longer receive updates in 5.1.

Although the legacy channels remain assigned to existing clients after migration, the corresponding repositories have been removed.

To ensure continued updates, users must:

- Mirror the new `SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Client Tools for XYZ` channels for the relevant products and assign them to the appropriate clients.
- Unassign the outdated `SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ` channels.

This also means that any CLM projects based on the old client tools must be adjusted accordingly.
