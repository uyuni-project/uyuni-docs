== {sle-micro} 5.5 to {sl-micro} 6.1


This document provides the tested procedure to upgrade a {sle-micro} 5.5 host deployed with {productname} 5.0 Server to {sl-micro} 6.1 and migrate to {productname} {productnumber}.

=== Prerequisites

* {productname} 5.0 is installed and running on {sle-micro} 5.5.
* System is registered and has active subscriptions with {scc}.

=== Distribution Upgrade and Server Migration

.Procedure: Migration from {productname} 5.0 to {productname} {productnumber}
[role=procedure]
_____

. Verify Current Product Status

+

[source,console]
----
SUSEConnect --status-text
----

+

**Confirm:**

- Base OS: `SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro 5.5`
- Extension: `SUSE Manager Server 5.0 Extension`

+

. Ensure System is Updated

+

[source,console]
----
transactional-update patch
----

+


* If patches were applied, **reboot the system** before proceeding to migration:

[source,console]
----
reboot
----

* If no updates were found, you can proceed directly to the migration step.

+

. Start the Migration:

+

[source,console]
----
transactional-update migration --auto-agree-with-licenses --gpg-auto-import-keys
----

+

Follow the prompts and select the available migration to **SUSE Linux Micro 6.1** and **{productname} Server Extension 5.1**.

+

. Reboot to Apply Changes

+

[source,console]
----
reboot
----

+

. Post-Reboot Checks:

+

Verify upgraded OS and {productname} extension:
+

[source,console]
----
cat /etc/os-release
SUSEConnect --status-text
----

+

You should see:

- `SL-Micro 6.1`
- `Multi-Linux Manager Server Extension 5.1`

+

. Enable Root SSH Access (_if required_).
SL Micro 6.1 disables root login via SSH by default.
Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/sshd.conf`:

+

[source,console]
----
PermitRootLogin yes
----

+

And restart the service:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl restart sshd
----

+

For more information, see xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-remote-root-on-micro.adoc[].

. Upgrade Server Containers

+

[source,console]
----
mgradm upgrade podman
----

+

Follow the prompts to pull and configure the new 5.1.0 containers.


. Check running containers:

+

[source,console]
----
podman ps
----

+

You should see:

- `server:5.1.0`
- `server-postgresql:5.1.0`

+

. Verify {productname} Tools

+

[source,console]
----
mgradm --version
----

+

Expected output:

+

- Version `5.1.11` or later
- References `5.1.0`

=== Migration Complete

The system is now running {productname} 5.1 on SL Micro 6.1.
Continue with post-migration validation.
