.Supported operating system for the Server Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm}.

Container host::
A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like [systemitem]``Podman``, which lets it manage and deploy containers.
These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight.
This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments.
The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully.
An FQDN typically follows the format <host>.<domain>.com.

For instance:

* [literal]``mlm.example.com``
* [literal]``mlm.container.lab``

For more information, see the section on network requirements in xref:installation-and-upgrade:network-requirements.adoc[].
====

== Persistent Volumes

// This sections needs to be run by devs. How would a customer use custom storage? How do we set this up with mgradm?

{productname} {productnumber} defines the required persistent storage volumes by default.
These are created during installation by the [command]``mgradm`` tool if they do not already exist.

These volumes are created in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``, where [systemitem]``Podman`` stores its volumes by default.

.Recommendations
[NOTE]
====
You can leverage the simplicity of storage by mounting an external storage device to this directory.
Because it will store the {postgresql} database, binary packages for repositories, caches, operating system images, autoinstallation distributions, and configuration files, we have three recommendations:

Fast Storage::
This mount point should ideally be NVMe or SSD-class devices.
Slower storage will adversely affect {productname} performance.

Large Capacity::
Recommended minimum size for this is at least 300Â GB, and larger if there will be multiple Linux distributions or architectures to manage.

Recommended Filesystem::
XFS (though any supported filesystem for {sl-micro} {microversion} could work).

Optional::
You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on the expected volume path inside it such as [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``.
This adds to the complexity of a {productname} deployment, and may affect the resilience the default storage recommendation provides.

====


For a list of all persistent volumes in the container, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[].




[[deploy-mlm-server-host]]
==  Prepare {productname} Server Host

You can deploy {productname} on {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm}.
{sl-micro} is a transactional system, while {sles} is a full server operating system.

Depending on your decision, either continue with xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.adoc#deploy-mlm-server-micro[] or with xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.adoc#deploy-mlm-server-sles[] and skip the not selected section.



[[deploy-mlm-server-micro]]
=== Install {sl-micro} {microversion} and Deploy Server


==== Download the Installation Media

.Procedure: Downloading the Installation Media
. Locate the {sl-micro} {microversion} installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/.
. Download [filename]``SL-Micro-6.1-DVD-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso``.
. Prepare a DVD or USB flash drive with the downloaded [filename]``.iso`` image for installation.
. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive (USB disk or key) containing the installation image for {sl-micro} {microversion}.
. Boot or reboot your system.


For more information about preparing your machines (virtual or physical), see link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/6.1/html/Micro-deployment-images/index.html[Introduction to {sl-micro} {microversion} Deployment].


==== Install {sl-micro}

.Procedure: Installing {sl-micro} {microversion}

. Use the arrow keys to select [systemitem]``Installation``.
. Adjust keyboard and language.
. Click the [systemitem]``checkbox`` to accept the license agreement.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Select the registration method.
  For this example, we will register the server with {scclongform}.
+

.Registering {productname} as an Extension during Installation
[NOTE]
====
The {productname} {productnumber} containers are installed as extensions.
Depending on the specific extension needed from the list below, additional {scclongform} registration codes will be required for each.

* {productname} {productnumber} Server
* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
* Retail Branch Server
====

+

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {sl-micro} {microversion} entitlement is included within the {productname} entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code.
====

. Enter your {scclongform} email address.
. Enter your registration code for {sl-micro} {microversion}.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Server extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Server extension registration code.
. Click btn:[Next] to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``NTP Configuration`` page click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Authentication for the System`` page enter a password for the root user.
  Click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` page click btn:[Install].

This concludes installation of {sl-micro} {microversion} and {productname} {productnumber} as an extension.



==== Registration from the Command Line (Optional)

If you added {productname} {productnumber} as an extension during {sl-micro} {microversion} installation then you can skip this step. However, optionally you may skip registration during {sl-micro} {microversion} installation by selecting the btn:[Skip Registration] button.
This section provides steps on registering your products after {sl-micro} {microversion} installation.

.Procedure: Post Installation Product Registration
. Register {sl-micro} {microversion} to {scclongform} from the command line run the following commands on the container host:
+
----
transactional-update register -r <reg_code> -e <your_email>
----

. Use the registration code you obtained from your {scclongform} account for {sl-micro} {microversion}.
+
[NOTE]
====
The following steps register a server with the {x86_64} architecture and thus require a registration code for the {x86_64} architecture.
To register {arm} or {s390x} architectures use the correct registration code.
====

. Next add the **{productname} Server Extension 5.1 x86_64** Extension.
  List available extensions with the following command:

+

----
transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions
----

. Use your **{productname} Server Extension 5.1 x86_64** registration code with the following command:

+

----
transactional-update register -p SUSE-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code>
----
. Reboot.


==== Update the System

.Procedure: Updating the System
. Log in as *root*.
. Run **transactional-update**:

+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sl-micro} is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates.
However, this behavior is not desirable for the {productname} environment.
To prevent automatic updates on your server, {productname} disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process.

If you prefer the {sl-micro} default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command:

[source, shell]
----
systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer
----
====

To continue with deployment, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.adoc#deploy-mlm-server-persistent-storage[].


[[deploy-mlm-server-sles]]
=== Install {sles} {bci-mlm} and Deploy Server

Alternatively, you can deploy {productname} on {sles} {bci-mlm}.


The following procedure describes the main steps of the installation process.

.Procedure: Installing {productname} on {sles} {bci-mlm}
. Locate and download {sles} {bci-mlm} [literal]``.iso`` at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/.
// FIXME Do we need the following step?
+
. Make sure that the {scc} code you plan to use has the Extensions enabled.
. Start the installation of {sles} {bci-mlm}.
  .. On the [literal]``Language, keyboard and product selection`` select the product to install.
  .. On the [literal]``License agreement`` read the agreement and check [guimenu]``I Agree to the License Terms``.
. Select the registration method.

+

[NOTE]
====
For {sles} {bci-mlm}, you are required to have a valid {sles} subscription and corresponding regcode, which you must provide on this screen.
You will be required to enter the {productname} Extension regcode below.
====
. In the screen [literal]``Extensions and Modules Selection`` check the following:
  * {productname} Server Extension
  * Basesystem Module
  * Containers Module
. Complete the installation.
+

Enter the {productname} Extension regcode.
. When the installation completes, log in to the newly installed server as root.
. Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install):

+

[source,shell]
----
zypper up
----

. Reboot.
. Log in as root and install [package]``podman`` plus [package]``mgradm`` and [package]``mgradm-bash-completion`` (if not already automatically installed):

[source,shell]
----
zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion
----

To continue with deployment, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.adoc#deploy-mlm-server-persistent-storage[].



[[deploy-mlm-server-persistent-storage]]
== Configure Custom Persistent Storage

Configuring persistent storage is optional, but it is the only way to avoid serious trouble with container full disk conditions.
It is highly recommended to configure custom persistent storage with the [command]``mgr-storage-server`` tool.

* For more information, see [command]``mgr-storage-server --help``.
This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes.

+

Use the command in the following manner:

+

----
mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>]
----

+

For example:

+

----
mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1

----

+

[NOTE]
====
This command will create the persistent storage volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.

For more information, see

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[]
* xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-container-full-disk.adoc[]
====


[[deploy-mlm-server-mgradm]]
== Deploy {productname} with [literal]``mgradm``

.Procedure: Deploying {productname} {productnumber} Using [literal]``mgradm``
. Log in as root.
. Execute the following command, replacing `<multi-linux-manager.example.com>` with your fully qualified domain name:
+
[source,shell]
----
mgradm install podman <multi-linux-manager.example.com>
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the above command fails ensure that you have registered {productname} {productnumber}.
If you skipped registration during installation and now need to register from the command line, follow the steps below to log in to the registry:

[source,shell]
----
podman login -u <EMAIL> -p <REGISTRATION-CODE> registry.suse.com
----

Use the {productname} {productnumber} registration key when prompted.
====

. Enter a certificate and administrator account password when prompted.
+

[NOTE]
====
The administrator account password must be at least 5 characters and less
than 48 characters in length.
====
+

. Press btn:[Enter].
. Enter the email address of the administration account.
  Press btn:[Enter].
. Wait for deployment to complete.
. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.
. Enter your username (default is [literal]``admin``) and the password you set during the deployment process.

In this guide you deployed {productname} {productnumber} Server as a container.
Proceed to the next section to add your organization credentials for syncing with {scclongform}.


== Connect {productname} {productnumber} to {scclongform}

This section covers synchronizing with {scc} from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[[proc-admin-organization-credentials]]
.Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.
. Enter your username (default is [literal]``admin``) and the password you set during the deployment process.
. In the {productname} {webui}, select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. Point your browser to the {scclongform}.
. Select your organization from the left navigation.
. Select the users tab from the top of the page then btn:[Organization Credentials].
. Make a note of your **Mirroring credentials**.
. Back in the {productname} {webui} enter your [guimenu]``Username`` and [guimenu]``Password``, and confirm with btn:[Save].

When the credentials are confirmed with a green check-mark icon, proceed with <<proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync>>.


[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scclongform}
. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
  If you recently registered with {scclongform} a list of products will begin populating the table.
  This operation could take up to a few minutes.
  You can monitor the progress of the operation in section on the right ``Refresh the product catalog from {scclongform}``.
  The table of products lists architecture, channels, and status information.
  For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].
+
image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Use the ``Filter by product description`` and ``Filter by architecture`` to filter the list of displayed products.
  The channels listed on the btn:[Products] page provide repositories for clients.
+

* Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
  Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Click btn:[Add Products] at the top of the page to start product synchronization.

After adding the channel, {productname} will schedule the channel to be synchronized.
This can take a long time as {productname} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scclongform} to the local [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory of your server.

When the channel is fully synchronized, a bootstrap repository for it will be automatically generated.
This step is crucial for successfully bootstrapping clients, ensuring that the channel synchronization and distribution are operational on the client side. This completes the installation and configuration of {productname}, along with preparing the channels necessary for bootstrapping clients.

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can proceed with registering the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy or additional clients.

For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



== Entering the Container for Management

To get to a shell inside the container, run on the container host:
----
mgrctl term
