.Supported operating system for the Server Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm}.

Container host::
A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like [systemitem]``Podman``, which lets it manage and deploy containers.
These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight.
This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments.
The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully.
An FQDN typically follows the format <host>.<domain>.com.

For instance:

* [literal]``mlm.example.com``
* [literal]``mlm.container.lab``

For more information, see the section on network requirements in xref:installation-and-upgrade:network-requirements.adoc[].
====

== Persistent Volumes

// This sections needs to be run by devs. How would a customer use custom storage? How do we set this up with mgradm?

{productname} {productnumber} defines the required persistent storage volumes by default.
These are created during installation by the [command]``mgradm`` tool if they do not already exist.

These volumes are created in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``, where [systemitem]``Podman`` stores its volumes by default.

.Recommendations
[NOTE]
====
You can leverage the simplicity of storage by mounting an external storage device to this directory.
Because it will store the {postgresql} database, binary packages for repositories, caches, operating system images, autoinstallation distributions, and configuration files, we have three recommendations:

Fast Storage::
This mount point should ideally be NVMe or SSD-class devices.
Slower storage will adversely affect {productname} performance.

Large Capacity::
Recommended minimum size for this is at least 300Â GB, and larger if there will be multiple Linux distributions or architectures to manage.

Recommended Filesystem::
XFS (though any supported filesystem for {sl-micro} {microversion} could work).

Optional::
You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on the expected volume path inside it such as [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``.
This adds to the complexity of a {productname} deployment, and may affect the resilience the default storage recommendation provides.

====


For a list of all persistent volumes in the container, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[].




[[deploy-mlm-server-host]]
==  Prepare {productname} Server Host

You can deploy {productname} on {sl-micro} {microversion} or {sles} {bci-mlm}.
{sl-micro} is a transactional system, while {sles} is a full server operating system.

Depending on your decision, either continue with xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.adoc#deploy-mlm-server-micro[] or with xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.adoc#deploy-mlm-server-sles[] and skip the not selected section.

[[deploy-mlm-server-persistent-storage]]
== Configure Custom Persistent Storage

Configuring persistent storage is optional, but it is the only way to avoid serious trouble with container full disk conditions.
It is highly recommended to configure custom persistent storage with the [command]``mgr-storage-server`` tool.

* For more information, see [command]``mgr-storage-server --help``.
This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes.

+

Use the command in the following manner:

+

----
mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>]
----

+

For example:

+

----
mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1

----

+

[NOTE]
====
This command will create the persistent storage volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.

For more information, see

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[]
* xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-container-full-disk.adoc[]

[[deploy-mlm-server-mgradm]]
== Deploy {productname} with [literal]``mgradm``

.Procedure: Deploying {productname} {productnumber} Using [literal]``mgradm``
. Log in as root.
. Execute the following command, replacing `<multi-linux-manager.example.com>` with your fully qualified domain name:
+
[source,shell]
----
mgradm install podman <multi-linux-manager.example.com>
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the above command fails ensure that you have registered {productname} {productnumber}.
If you skipped registration during installation and now need to register from the command line, follow the steps below to log in to the registry:

[source,shell]
----
podman login -u <EMAIL> -p <REGISTRATION-CODE> registry.suse.com
----

Use the {productname} {productnumber} registration key when prompted.
====

. Enter CA key (certificate authority) and administrator account password when prompted.
+

[NOTE]
====
The administrator account password must be at least 5 characters and less
than 48 characters in length.
====
+

. Press btn:[Enter].
. Enter the email address of the administration account.
  Press btn:[Enter].
. Wait for deployment to complete.
. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.
. Enter your username (default is [literal]``admin``) and the password you set during the deployment process.

In this guide you deployed {productname} {productnumber} Server as a container.
Proceed to the next section to add your organization credentials for syncing with {scclongform}.


== Connect {productname} {productnumber} to {scclongform}

This section covers synchronizing with {scc} from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[[proc-admin-organization-credentials]]
.Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.
. Enter your username (default is [literal]``admin``) and the password you set during the deployment process.
. In the {productname} {webui}, select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. Point your browser to the {scclongform}.
. Select your organization from the left navigation.
. Select the users tab from the top of the page then btn:[Organization Credentials].
. Make a note of your **Mirroring credentials**.
. Back in the {productname} {webui} enter your [guimenu]``Username`` and [guimenu]``Password``, and confirm with btn:[Save].

When the credentials are confirmed with a green check-mark icon, proceed with <<proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync>>.


[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scclongform}
. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
  If you recently registered with {scclongform} a list of products will begin populating the table.
  This operation could take up to a few minutes.
  You can monitor the progress of the operation in section on the right ``Refresh the product catalog from {scclongform}``.
  The table of products lists architecture, channels, and status information.
  For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].
+
image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Use the ``Filter by product description`` and ``Filter by architecture`` to filter the list of displayed products.
  The channels listed on the btn:[Products] page provide repositories for clients.
+

* Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
  Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Click btn:[Add Products] at the top of the page to start product synchronization.

After adding the channel, {productname} will schedule the channel to be synchronized.
This can take a long time as {productname} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scclongform} to the local [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory of your server.

When the channel is fully synchronized, a bootstrap repository for it will be automatically generated.
This step is crucial for successfully bootstrapping clients, ensuring that the channel synchronization and distribution are operational on the client side. This completes the installation and configuration of {productname}, along with preparing the channels necessary for bootstrapping clients.

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can proceed with registering the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy or additional clients.

For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



== Entering the Container for Management

To get to a shell inside the container, run on the container host:
