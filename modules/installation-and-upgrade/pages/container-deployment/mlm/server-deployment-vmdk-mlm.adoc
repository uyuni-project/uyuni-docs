This chapter provides the required Virtual Machine settings for deployment of {productname} {productnumber} as an Image.
VMware will be used as a sandbox for this installation.

== Available Images

[IMPORTANT]
====
The preferred method for deploying {productname} {productnumber} Server is to use one of the following available images.
All tools are included in these images greatly simplifying deployment.
====

Images for {productname} {productnumber} are available at link:https://www.suse.com/download/suse-manager/[{productname} {productnumber} VM images].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Customized {productname} {productnumber} VM images are provided only for {sle-micro} {microversion}.
To run the product on {sles} {bci-mlm}, use the standard {sles} {bci-mlm} installation media available at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/ and enable the {productname} {productnumber} extensions on top of it.

== {productname} Virtual Machine Settings - VMware

This sections describes VMware configurations, focusing on the creation of an extra virtual disk essential for the {productname} storage partition within VMware environments.

.Procedure: Creating the VMware Virtual Machine

. Download {productname} Server [filename]``.vmdk`` file then transfer a copy to your VMware storage.

. Make a copy of uploaded [filename]``.vmdk`` file using VMware web interface.
  This will convert provided [filename]``.vmdk`` file to the format suitable for vSphere hypervisor.

. Create and name a new virtual machine based on the Guest OS Family [systemitem]``Linux`` and Guest OS Version {sle} 15 (64-bit).

// FIXME: do we want to keep this size here? \/

+

. Add an additional [systemitem]``Hard Disk 2`` of 500 GB (or more).

. Configure RAM and number of CPUs with minimum values. *)

. Set the network adapter as required.

. Power on the VM, and follow firstboot dialogs (keyboard layout, license agreement, time zone, password for root).

. When installation completes log in as root.

. Proceed to the next section.

*) For minimum values, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#proxy-hardware-requirements[].

== Register {sl-micro} and {productname} {productnumber} Server

Before starting obtain your {productname} Registration Code from {scclongform} - https://scc.suse.com.

[NOTE]
====
The {sl-micro} {microversion} entitlement is included within the {productname} entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code.
====

.Procedure: Registering {sl-micro} and {productname} {productnumber}
. Boot the virtual machine.
. Log in as `root`.
. Register {sl-micro} with {scc}.
+

----
transactional-update register -r <REGCODE> -e <your_email>
----

. Reboot.

. Register {productname} {productnumber} with {scclongform}.
+

----
transactional-update register -p SUSE-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <REGCODE>
----

. Reboot
. Update the system:
+

----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied reboot.

. This step is optional.
  However, if custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the [command]``mgr-storage-server`` tool.
** For more information, see [command]``mgr-storage-server --help``.
This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes.

** Use the command in the following manner:
+

----
mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>]
----
+
For example:
+
----
mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command will create the persistent storage volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.

For more information, see

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[]
* xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-container-full-disk.adoc[]
====
. Run the following command to deploy {productname}:
+

----
mgradm install podman <FQDN>
----
