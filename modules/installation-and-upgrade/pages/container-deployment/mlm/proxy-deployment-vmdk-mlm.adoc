This chapter provides the Virtual Machine settings for deployment of {productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an image.
VMware will be used as a sandbox for this installation.



// FIXME: make this section a snippet or move it to a general intro for both,
//        KVM and VMware
== Available Images

[IMPORTANT]
====
The preferred method for deploying {productname} Proxy is to use one of the following available images.
All tools are included in these images greatly simplifying deployment.
====

Images for {productname} {productnumber} Proxy are available at link:https://www.suse.com/download/suse-manager/[{productname} {productnumber} VM images].

== Virtual Machine Settings - VMware

This sections describes VMware configurations, focusing on the creation of an extra virtual disk essential for the {productname} Proxy storage partition within VMware environments.


.Procedure: Creating the VMware Virtual Machine

. Download {productname} Proxy [filename]``.vmdk`` file then transfer a copy to your VMware storage.

. Make a copy of uploaded [filename]``.vmdk`` file using VMware web interface.
  This will convert provided [filename]``.vmdk`` file to the format suitable for vSpere hypervisor.

. Create and name a new virtual machine based on the Guest OS Family [systemitem]``Linux`` and Guest OS Version {sle} 15 (64-bit).

. Add an additional [systemitem]``Hard Disk 2`` of 500 GB (or more).

. Configure RAM and number of CPUs (at least 16 GB RAM and 4 CPUs).

. Set the network adapter as required.

. Power on the VM, and follow firstboot dialogs (keyboard layout, license agreement, time zone, password for root).

. When installation completes log in as root.

. Proceed to the next section.

=== Using a Custom Container Image for a Service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with [literal]``-tag`` and [literal]``-image``.

For example, use it like this:

----
mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds`` is the image to use and [literal]``0.1.0`` is the version tag, before restarting it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters:

----
mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.
