= Convert a Client to MLM Proxy

:description: Ensure your Client system is subscribed to the Proxy Extension channel and has valid SSL certificates before conversion.
== Overview

This chapter describes how to convert a client system into a {productname} Proxy using the {webui}.

It assumes that the proxy host system has already been bootstrapped, is subscribed to the base operating system channel (such as  {sles} 15 SP7 or {sl-micro} 6.1) and to the Proxy Extension channel.

For information about client onboarding, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].

== Requirements

Before starting the conversion, ensure the following requirements are fulfilled.


=== Supported Systems

Only the following operating systems are currently supported for proxy conversion:

* {sles} 15 SP7
* {sl-micro} 6.1

=== Client Must Be

- Already onboarded in {productname}
- Reachable via the network
- Subscribed to the appropriate proxy extension channel:
** {productname} Proxy Extension 5.1 (matching architecture)


== Preparation

Before proceeding with the proxy conversion, make sure the following preparations are completed to avoid interruptions during the conversion process.

=== SSL Certificates

Valid SSL certificates are required to secure communication between the proxy and other components.

You need:

* The public certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the certificate on the {productname} server
* A certificate for the proxy.
* The corresponding private key for the proxy certificate.

[NOTE]
====
If your CA uses an intermediate certificate chain, you must include all intermediate certificates as well.
====

If you are not using third party certificates, you can generate them using the `rhn-ssl-tool` inside the {productname} container.

.Generate a proxy certificate

. On the {productname} server host, run:
+
[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server \
  --set-hostname="<PROXY-FQDN>" \
  --dir="/root/ssl-build"
----
+
For more information about other parameters, see xref:administration:ssl-certs-selfsigned.adoc[].
+

. Transfer the certificates to {productname} server host
+
[source,shell]
----
mgrctl cp server:/root/ssl-build/<PROXY-FQDN>/server.crt /root/proxycert.pem
mgrctl cp server:/root/ssl-build/<PROXY-FQDN>/server.key /root/proxykey.pem
mgrctl cp server:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT /root/rootca.pem
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To confirm the exact folder where the certificates and key files were generated, you can list the directories with:
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- ls -ltd /root/ssl-build/*/
----
====

. Transfer the certificates from the {productname} server host to your local machine or other target system:
+

[source,shell]
----
scp <MLM-FQDN>:/root/proxycert.pem ./
scp <MLM-FQDN>:/root/proxykey.pem ./
scp <MLM-FQDN>:/root/rootca.pem ./
----

=== Packages Preparation

It is recommended to deploy the container images as RPM packages. Please ensure the following packages are installed on the client:

* suse-multi-linux-manager-5.1-<ARCH>-proxy-httpd-image
* suse-multi-linux-manager-5.1-<ARCH>-proxy-salt-broker-image
* suse-multi-linux-manager-5.1-<ARCH>-proxy-squid-image
* suse-multi-linux-manager-5.1-<ARCH>-proxy-ssh-image
* suse-multi-linux-manager-5.1-<ARCH>-proxy-tftpd-image

You can install these packages from the {webui} by navigating to the [literal]``Software`` > [literal]``Packages`` >  [literal]``Install`` tab, then searching for the packages above, and installing them.

For details on air-gapped deployment, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/proxy-air-gapped-deployment-mlm.adoc[]

== Setup Proxy Client

. Navigate to the client's [literal]``Overview`` page.
. Click button btn:[Convert to Proxy].
+
Confirm you were redirected to the proxy configuration form.
+
This page can be accessed later from the [literal]``Details`` > [literal]``Proxy`` > [literal]``Configuration`` tab.

. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Proxy[Configuration] and fill in the required data:

+
.Procedure: Configuring the Proxy
.. In the [guimenu]``Parent FQDN`` field, type the fully qualified domain name for the parent server or proxy.
.. In the [guimenu]``Proxy SSH port`` field, type the SSH port on which the SSH service is listening on the {productname} Proxy. It is recommended to keep the default: 8022.
.. In the [guimenu]``Max Squid cache size`` field, type the maximum allowed size for the Squid cache, in Gigabytes.
.. In the [guimenu]``Proxy admin email`` field, type the administrator's email address.
.. In the [literal]``Certificates`` section, provide the certificates for the {productname} Proxy, obtained in the preparation step.

.. In the [literal]``Source`` section, select one of the two options: [literal]``RPM`` or [literal]``Registry``.
+
* The [literal]``RPM`` option is recommended for air-gapped or restricted environments.
* The [literal]``Registry`` option can be used if connectivity to the container image registry is available. +
If selected, you will be prompted to choose between two sub-options: [literal]``Simple`` or [literal]``Advanced``.
+
** If [literal]``Simple`` is selected, provide values in the [literal]``Registry URL`` and [literal]``Containers Tag`` fields.
*** For [literal]``Registry URL`` use: [literal]``registry.suse.com/suse/multi-linux-manager/5.1/x86_64``.
*** Select the tag from the drop-down list.

** If [literal]``Advanced`` is selected, an additional section of the form is shown:
*** For each individual container URL field, use the registry: [literal]``registry.suse.com/suse/multi-linux-manager/5.1/x86_64`` followed by the corresponding suffix, for example, `_proxy-httpd_` or `_salt-broker_`.
*** Select the tag from the drop-down list.

. Once all fields are filled, click btn:[Apply] to apply the configuration and schedule the proxy installation task.

== Verify Proxy Activation

Check the client’s event history to confirm task success.

(Optional) Access the proxy’s HTTP endpoint to validate it shows a welcome page.
