== Deployment preparations

In this section, you will gain expertise in setting up and deploying a {productname} Server. The process encompasses the installation of [command]``Podman``, [filename]``Uyuni container utilities``, deployment, and then initiating your interaction with the container through [command]``mgrctl``.

It is important to note that this section assumes you have already configured a {tumbleweed} or {opensuse} {opensuse-version} server, whether it's running on a physical machine or within a virtual environment.



== Installing Podman on openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} and {tumbleweed}


To install [command]``Podman`` on either {opensuse} {opensuse-version} or {opensuse} {tumbleweed}, proceed with the following steps.

.Procedure: Installing Podman
. Open a terminal window.

. Update the package manager's repository information to ensure you have the latest package information:
+

[source,shell]
----
sudo zypper refresh
----

. Install [command]``Podman`` by running the following command:
+

[source,shell]
----
sudo zypper -y install podman
----

. Zypper will download and install [command]``Podman`` along with its dependencies.

. Once the installation is complete, verify that [command]``Podman`` is installed by running:
+

[source,shell]
----
podman --version
----
+

This command should display the installed version of [command]``Podman``.
You should now have [command]``Podman`` successfully installed on your openSUSE Leap 15.5 system, and you can start using it to manage containers on your system.

== Installing Uyuni tools for use with containers

=== {opensuse} {opensuse-version}

.Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on {opensuse} {opensuse-version}
. Add the following repository to your {opensuse} {opensuse-version} server and accept the key.
+

----
sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Master:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Leap_15.5/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master:ContainerUtils.repo
----

. Install tools:
+

----
sudo zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion netavark
----

=== {opensuse} {tumbleweed}

.Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on {opensuse} {tumbleweed}
. Add the following repository to your {opensuse} {tumbleweed} server and accept the key.
+

----
sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Master:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master:ContainerUtils.repo
----

. Install tools:
+

----
sudo zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion netavark
----

== Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman



=== mgradm overview


{productname} is deployed as a container using the mgradm tool, assuming you have already installed the necessary tools in earlier steps. 
There are two approaches to deploying a {productname} server as a container:

Beginner Path:: You can start container deployment by executing the mgradm command. This will guide you through entering basic server variables.

Intermediate Path:: Alternatively, you have the option to create a custom [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` file, which the [command]``mgradm`` tool can utilize during deployment. For detailed instructions on configuring [filename]``mgradm.yaml``, please refer to xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mgradm-yaml-custom-configuration.adoc[Custom YAML configuration with mgradm].

For additional information, you can explore further by running [command]``mgradm --help`` from the command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[command]``mgradm`` will prompt for basic variables if they are not provided using command line parameters or the [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` configuration file. 

For security, **using command line parameters to specify passwords should be avoided**: use a configuration file with proper permissions instead.
====

=== Persistent volumes

Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes.

[NOTE]
====
If you are just testing out {productname} you do not need to specify these volumes. [command]``mgradm`` will setup the correct volumes by default.

Specifiying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments.
====

By default [command]``Podman`` stores its volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``. 

You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``. This is especially important for the database and package mirrors. 

For a list of all persistent volumes in the container see,  xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[Persistent container volumes]
