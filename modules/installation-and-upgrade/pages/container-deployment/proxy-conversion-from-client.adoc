= Proxy conversion from client

== Introduction

This chapter describes how {productname} proxy can be registered with {productname} server.
The main principle consists of using a functionality within {webui} which converts an already onboarded client to a proxy.

The client which is a candidate for conversion to proxy must adhere to the following pre-requisites:

* it must already be onboarded
* it is reachable
* it has access to client tools 

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]
* it is a transactional system
endif::[]


== Convert the client to {productname} Proxy

The process of conversion is done entirely from the {webui} for already registered clients. 
For more information about client onboarding, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].

Either procedure can be used, and will achieve the same outcome.
