= Deploy {productname} {productnumber} Proxy as a Virtual Machine

This chapter provides the Virtual Machine settings for deployment of {productname} {productnumber} as an image.
KVM will be combined with Virtual Machine Manager (_virt-manager_) as a sandbox for this installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The preferred method for deploying {productname} {productnumber} Proxy is to use one of the following available images. All tools are included in these images greatly simplifying deployment.

== Register {sl-micro} and {productname} {productnumber}


.Procedure: Registering {sl-micro} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
. Boot the virtual machine.
. Log in as `root`.
. Register {sl-micro} with SCC.
+

----
transactional-update register -r <REGCODE> -e <your_email>
----

. Reboot.

. Register {productname} {productnumber} with {scc}.
+

----
transactional-update register -p SUSE-Manager-Proxy/5.0/x86_64 -r <REGCODE>
----

. Reboot.

. Update the system:
+

----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied reboot.



== Create an Activation Key for the Proxy

On the {productname} server, create an activation key for the Proxy. 

.Task: Create an Activation Key
. Navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys], and click btn:[Create key].
. Create an activation key for the proxy host with {sl-micro} {microversion} as the parent channel.
  This key should include all recommended channels and the Proxy as an extension child channel.
. Proceed to boostrapping the proxy host as a minion.



== Bootstrap the Proxy Host

.Task: Bootstrap the Proxy Host
. Select menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. Fill in the fields for your proxy host.
. Select the Activation key created in the previous step from the dropdown.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap].
. Wait for the Bootstrap process to complete successfully.
  Check the menu:Salt[] menu and confirm the {salt} key is listed and accepted.
. Reboot the proxy host.
. Select the host from the menu:System[] list and trigger a second reboot after all events are finished to conclude the onboarding.


.Task: Update the Proxy Host
. Select the host from the menu:Systems[] list and apply all patches to update it.
. Reboot the proxy host.



[[proxy-setup-containers-generate-config]]
== Generate the Proxy Configuration

The configuration archive of the {productname} Proxy is generated by the {productname} Server. 
Each additional proxy requires its own configuration archive.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The container host for the {productname} Proxy must be registered as client to the {productname} Server prior to generating this proxy configuration.
====


You will perform the following tasks:

1. Generate a Proxy configuration file.
2. Transfer the configuration to the Proxy.
3. Start the Proxy with the [literal]``mgrpxy`` command.

[[proc-proxy-containers-setup-webui]]
.Procedure: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration using {webui}

. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Proxy Configuration] and fill the required data:
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy.
. In the [guimenu]``Parent FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the {productname} Server or another {productname} Proxy.
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy SSH port`` field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on {productname} Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022.
. In the [guimenu]``Max Squid cache size [MB]`` field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Typically this should be at most 60% of available storage for the containers.
. In the [guimenu]``SSL certificate`` selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for {productname} Proxy or an existing one should be used.
You can consider generated certificates as {productname} builtin (self signed) certificates.
+
Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate.
+
The CA certificates generated on the server are stored in the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/ssl-build`` directory.
+
For more information about existing or custom certificates and the concept of corporate and intermediate certificates, see  xref:administration:ssl-certs-imported.adoc[].

. Click btn:[Generate] to register new proxy FQDN in {productname} Server and generate configuration archive with details for container host.
. After a few moments you are presented with file to download. Save this file locally.

image::suma_proxy_containerized_webui.png[scaledwidth=80%]

[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-config]]
== Transfer the Proxy Configuration

The {webui} generates a configuration archive.
This archive needs to be made available on the proxy container host.


.Procedure: Copying the Proxy Configuration
. Copy the files from the Server container to the Server host OS:
+
----
mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz .
----

. Next copy the files from the Server host OS to the Proxy host: 
+
----
scp config.tar.gz <proxy-FQDN>:/root
----

. Install the Proxy with:
+ 

----
mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz
----



[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-start]]
== Start the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy

Container can now be started with the [literal]`mgrpxy` command:

[[proc-setup-containers-setup-start]]
.Procedure: Start and Check Proxy Status

. Start the Proxy by calling:
+

----
mgrpxy start
----

. Check container status by calling:
+

----
mgrpxy status
----
+

Five {productname} Proxy containers should be present:

- proxy-salt-broker
- proxy-httpd
- proxy-tftpd
- proxy-squid
- proxy-ssh

And should be part of the [literal]``proxy-pod`` container pod.


////
[[installation-proxy-containers-services]]
== Install container services on the host system
ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[NOTE]
====
[literal]``Containers Module`` is required to be available for container host on a {sles} machine.
====
endif::[]

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

First step is to install the [literal]``mgrpxy`` utility provided by the package of the same name.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
The [literal]``mgrpxy`` package is available in the {productname} Proxy product repositories.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
The [literal]``mgrpxy`` package is available in the container utils repository: pick the one matching the distribution in: https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/.
endif::[]

To install them run:

----
zypper in helm mgrpxy
---- 
////


=== Using a Custom Container Image for a Service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with [literal]``-tag`` and [literal]``-image``.

For example, use it like this:

----
mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds`` is the image to use and [literal]``0.1.0`` is the version tag, before restarting it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters:

----
mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.
