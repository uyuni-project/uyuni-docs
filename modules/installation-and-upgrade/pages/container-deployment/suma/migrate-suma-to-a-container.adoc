= Migrating the {productname} server to a containerized environment

// We need to figure out which SUMA versions prior to the container release can or should be migrated. Something like any version prior to yyyy.mm and later than.

To migrate a {productname} {productnumber} server to a container, a new machine is required.

[NOTE]
====
It is not possible to perform an in-place migration. 
====

The original server is referred to as the **source server,** while the newly set-up machine is designated as the **destination server.**

The migration procedure currently does not include any hostname renaming functionality.
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the destination server will remain identical to the one of the source server.
Therefore, after the migration, it will be necessary to manually adjust the DNS records to point to the new server.


== Initial Preparation on the Source Server

.Procedure: Initial preparation on the source server
. Stop the {productname} services:
+

----
spacewalk-service stop
----

. Stop the PostgreSQL service:
+

----
systemctl stop postgresql
----


== Prepare the SSH Connection

.Procedure: Preparing the SSH connection
. The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the destination server for a passwordless connection to the source server.
+

[NOTE]
====
To establish a passwordless connection, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the destination server.
If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running `eval $(ssh-agent)`.
Then, add the SSH key to the running agent with `ssh-add /path/to/the/private/key`.
You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process.
==== 

. The migration script only uses the source server's FQDN in the SSH command. 

. This means that every other configuration required to connect, needs to be defined in the [path]``~/.ssh/config`` file.


== Perform the Migration

.Procedure: Performing the Migration
. Execute the following command to install a new {productname} server, replacing **<source.fqdn>** with the appropriate FQDN of the source server:
+

----
mgradm migrate podman <source.fqdn>
----

// uncomment when kubernetes support is added
//----
//mgradm migrate kubernetes <source.fqdn>
//----
