[[sumavm.ignition]]
== {productname} basic configuration using [systemitem]``Ignition``

[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname} image does not set up [systemitem]``root`` or any other user account.
User or [systemitem]``root`` authentications need to be set up during first boot.
This can be done using [systemitem]``Ignition`` or [systemitem]``Cloud-Init`` methods.
====

[systemitem]``Ignition`` is a provisioning tool that enables you to configure a system according to your specification on the first boot.
When the system is booted for the first time, [systemitem]``Ignition`` is loaded as part of an initramfs and searches for a configuration file within a specific directory (on a USB flash disk, or you can provide a URL).

[systemitem]``Ignition`` uses a configuration file in the JSON format.
The file is called [path]``config.ign``.

The [path]``config.ign`` is a JSON configuration file that provides prescriptions for Ignition.
You can either create the file manually in JSON, or you can use the Fuel Ignition tool to generate a basic set of prescriptions.
The Fuel Ignition tool does not provide a full set of options, so you might have to modify the file manually.
For more information, see https://ignite.opensuse.org/.

When installing, the configuration file [path]``config.ign`` must reside in the [path]``ignition`` subdirectory on the configuration media labeled [systemitem]``ignition``.
The directory structure must look as follows:

----
<root directory>
└── ignition
    └── config.ign
----

If you intend to configure a QEMU/KVM virtual machine, provide the path to the [path]``config.ign`` file as an attribute of the qemu command.
For example:

----
-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=PATH_TO_config.ign
----

The [path]``config.ign`` file contains various data types: objects, strings, integers, booleans, and lists of objects.
For the complete specification, see https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_3/.



// FIXME: we probably do not need this section
=== Set Root Password Using [systemitem]``Ignition``

The {productname} VM image does not set up root or any other user account.
User or [systemitem]``root`` authentications need to be set up during first boot.
The [literal]``passwd`` attribute is used to add users.
If you intend to log in the system, create root and set the root's password and/or add the SSH key to the [systemitem]``Ignition`` configuration.
You need to hash the root password, for example, by using the [command]``openssl`` command:

----
openssl passwd -6
----

The command creates a hash of the password you chose.
Use this hash as the value of the [literal]``passwordHash`` attribute.

The users attribute must contain at least one [literal]``name`` attribute.
[literal]``ssh_authorized_keys`` is a list of ssh keys for the user.

Create the [path]``root/ignition/config.ign`` file with the following content:

----
{
  "ignition": {
    "version": "3.2.0"
  },
  "passwd": {
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "root",
        "passwordHash": "$2a$10$qV298UV11u9lCFDjpHpCUe1cErBiVR.G3shukxs3.2PAO1xhJWs0K"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Prepare the [systemitem]``Ignition`` ISO file using the command:

----
mkisofs -full-iso9660-filenames -o suma_ignition.iso -V ignition root
----

Attach the created [path]``suma_ignition.iso`` file as a volume to the virtual machine at first boot.
This particular example is setting the [systemitem]``root`` password to `linux`.
Substitute your password hash for the one in this example.

For more information about [systemitem]``Ignition``, see https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.4/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/#cha-images-ignition.



// FIXME: we probably do not need this section
[[sumavm.cloud_init]]
== {productname} basic configuration using Cloud Init disk

[systemitem]``Cloud Init`` is a provisioning tool that enables you to configure a system according to your specification on the first boot.
When the system is booted for the first time, [systemitem]``Cloud Init service`` is loaded and searches for a configuration file within a specific directory (on a USB flash disk, or you can provide a URL).

[systemitem]``Cloud Init`` uses few configuration files in the YAML format. Used files are named [path]``meta-data``, [path]``network-config`` and [path]``user-data``.

[systemitem]``Cloud Init`` allows numerous sources where to store configuration data. 
In this guide we use local iso image with volume id [literal]``cidata`` as a source. 
The directory structure must look as follows:

----
<root directory>
└── meta-data
└── network-config
└── user-data
----

If you intend to configure a QEMU/KVM virtual machine, provide the path to the [path]``config.ign`` as an attribute of the qemu command.
For example:

----
-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=PATH_TO_config.ign
----

The [systemitem]``Cloud Init`` allows many management options. For a complete specification, refer to Cloud Init specification (https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

// FIXME: we probably do not need this section
=== Set Up Root Password Using Cloud Init

You need to hash the root password, for example, by using the [command]``openssl`` command:

----
openssl passwd -6
----

The command creates a hash of the password you chose.
Use this hash as the value of the [literal]``password`` attribute.

Prepare the needed configuration files using the following commands:

----
touch network-config
touch meta-data
----

Create a file named [path]``user-data`` with the following content:

----
#cloud-config
chpasswd:
  expire: false
  users:
    - name: root
      password: $2a$10$qV298UV11u9lCFDjpHpCUe1cErBiVR.G3shukxs3.2PAO1xhJWs0K
----

Prepare [systemitem]``Cloud Init`` ISO file using the command:

----
mkisofs -rational-rock -joliet -o suma_cloudinit.iso -V cidata network-config meta-data user-data
----

Attach the created [path]``suma_cloudinit.iso`` file as a volume to the creating virtual machine.
This particular example is setting [systemitem]``root`` password to `linux`.
Substitute your password hash for the one in this example

== {productname} Virtual Machine Settings - VMware

This sections describes VMware configurations, focusing on the creation of an extra virtual disk essential for the {productname} storage partition within VMware environments.

.Procedure: Creating the VMware Virtual Machine

. Download {productname} Server [filename]``.vmdk`` file then transfer a copy to your VMware storage.

. Upload the prepared Ignition or Cloud Init disk file you created using the instructions above.

. Create and name a new virtual machine based on the Guest OS Family [systemitem]``Linux`` and Guest OS Version {sle} 15 (64-bit).

. In [guimenu]``Customize settings`` browse to the uploaded [filename]``.vmdk`` using [systemitem]``IDE controller 0`` storage device in the [systemitem]``Controller Location``.

. Add an additional [systemitem]``Hard Disk 2`` of 500 GB (or more).

. Configure RAM and number of CPUs (at least 16 GB RAM and 4 CPUs).

. Set the network adapter as required.

. Set the [systemitem]``CD/DVD Drive 1`` to use the uploaded configuration as a [systemitem]``Datastore ISO``.
  Check the box next to btn:[Connect].
  This drive must be present when you power on the machine initially.

. Power on the VM, and log in using credentials set by configuration disk.


[[minimal.susemgr.prep]]
== Preparing Virtual Machine for {productname}

Before starting obtain your SUSE Manager Registration Code from SUSE Customer Center - https://scc.suse.com.


// FIXME
// Here we probably want to use sl-micro and thus transactional-update
// See server-deployment-vm-suma, section "Register {sl-micro} and
// {productname} {productnumber} Server

[[proc.minimal.susemgr.prep]]
.Procedure: Preparing for {productname} run

. Log in as `root`.

. Register {productname} with SCC.
  For example, replace `<productnumber>` with `{productnumber}` and `<architecture>` with `x86_64`:
+

----
SUSEConnect -e <EMAIL_ADDRESS> -r <SUSE_MANAGER_CODE> \
  -p SUSE-Manager-Server/<productnumber>/<architecture>
----

. Validate the authorized extensions by running the list extensions command:
+

----
SUSEConnect --list-extensions
----

. Add {productname} repositories:
+

----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-basesystem/15.4/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-server-applications/15.4/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-web-scripting/15.4/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-suse-manager-server/<productnumber>/x86_64
----

. Prepare {productname} storage:
  [path]``mgr-storage-server`` command automatically prepares and configures previously created external storage for use with {productname}.
  In the following command the first parameter is the device for {productname} data, the second parameter is the device for the database.
+

----
mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>]
----
+
For example:
+
----
mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command will create the persistent storage volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.
