.Supported operating system for the Server Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {micro} {microversion}.

Container host::
A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers.
These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight.
This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments.
The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully.
An FQDN typically follows the format <host>.<domain>.com.

For instance:

* [literal]``suma.example.com``
* [literal]``suma.container.lab``

For more information, see the section on network requirements in xref:installation-and-upgrade:network-requirements.adoc[].
====

== Persistent Volumes

// This sections needs to be run by devs. How would a customer use custom storage? How do we set this up with mgradm?

{productname} {productnumber} defines the required persistent storage volumes by default.
These are created during installation by the [command]``mgradm`` tool if they do not already exist.

These volumes are created in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``, where [systemitem]``Podman`` stores its volumes by default.

.Recommendations
[NOTE]
====
You can leverage the simplicity of storage by mounting an external storage device to this directory.
Since it will store the {postgresql} database, binary packages for repositories, caches, operating system images, autoinstallation distributions, and configuration files, we have three recommendations:

Fast Storage::
This mount point should ideally be NVMe or SSD-class devices.
Slower storage will adversely affect {productname} performance.

Large Capacity::
Recommended minimum size for this is at least 300 GB, and larger if there will be multiple Linux distributions or architectures to manage.

Recommended Filesystem::
XFS (though any supported filesystem for {micro} {microversion} could work).

====

Optional::
You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on the expected volume path inside it such as [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``.
This adds to the complexity of a {productname} deployment, and may affect the resilience the default storage recommendation provides.


For a list of all persistent volumes in the container, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[].

// To set up custom persistent volumes see:



== {micro} {microversion} Installation

.Procedure: Download the Installation Media
. Locate the {micro} {microversion} installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/.
. You will need an account with {scc} and must be logged in to download the ISO image.
. Download [filename]``SLE-Micro-5.5-DVD-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso``.
. Prepare a DVD or USB flash drive for installation.

.Registering {productname} as an Extension during Installation
[NOTE]
====
The {productname} {productnumber} container is installed as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring {scc} registration codes for {micro} {microversion}, you will also need {scc} registration codes for the following extensions:

* {productname} {productnumber} Server
* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
* Retail Branch Server

The following section uses a registration code for the {x86_64} architecture. To register {arm} or {s390x} architectures replace with the correct registration code.
====

. Enter your {scc} email address.
. Enter your registration code for {micro} {microversion}.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``Extension and Module Selection`` page, uncheck the **Hide Development Versions** checkbox. 
. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Server extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Server extension registration code.
. Click btn:[Next] to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``NTP Configuration`` page click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Authentication for the System`` page enter a password for the root user.
  Click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` page click btn:[Install].

This concludes installation of {micro} {microversion} and {productname} {productnumber} as an extension.



=== Registration from the Command Line (Optional)

If you added {productname} {productnumber} as an extension during {micro} {microversion} installation then you can skip this step. However, optionally you may skip registration during {micro} {microversion} installation by selecting the btn:[Skip Registration] button.
This section provides steps on registering your products after {micro} {microversion} installation.

.Procedure: Post Installation Product Registration
. Register {micro} {microversion} to {scc} from the command line run the following commands on the container host:
+
----
transactional-update register -r <reg_code> -e <your_email>
----

. Use the registration code you obtained from your {scc} account for {micro} {microversion}.
+
[NOTE]
====
The following section uses a registration code for the {x86_64} architecture. To register {arm} or {s390x} architectures replace it with the correct registration code.
====

. Next add the **SUSE Manager Server Extension 5.0 x86_64 (Beta)** Extension. List available extensions with the following command:
+
----
transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions
----

. Use your **SUSE Manager Server Extension 5.0 x86_64** registration code with the following command:
+
----
transactional-update register -p SUSE-Manager-Server/5.0/x86_64 -r <reg_code>
----
. Reboot.


=== Update the system


. Log in as *root*.
. Run **transactional-update**:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot.


== Deploy with mgradm

.Procedure: Deploy {productname} {productnumber} Using mgradm
. Log in as root.
. Execute the following command, replacing `<suma.example.com>` with your fully qualified domain name:
+
[source,shell]
----
mgradm install podman <suma.example.com>
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the above command fails ensure that you have registered {productname} {productnumber}.
If you skipped registration during installation and now need to register from the command line, follow the steps below to log in to the registry:

[source,shell]
----
podman login -u <EMAIL> -p <REGISTRATION-CODE> registry.suse.com
----

Use the {productname} {productnumber} registration key when prompted.
====

. Enter a certificate and administrator account password when prompted.
+

[NOTE]
====
The administrator account password must be at least 5 characters and less
than 48 characters in length.
====
+

. Press btn:[Enter].
. Enter the email address of the administration account.
  Press btn:[Enter].
. Wait for deployment to complete.
. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.
. Enter your username (default is [literal]``admin``) and the password you set during the deployment process.

In this guide you deployed {productname} {productnumber} Server as a container.
Proceed to the next section to add your organization credentials for syncing with {scc}.



== Connect {productname} {productnumber} to {scc}

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[[proc-admin-organization-credentials]]
.Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.
. Enter your username (default is [literal]``admin``) and the password you set during the deployment process.
. In the {productname} {webui}, select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. Point your browser to the {scc}.
. Select your organization from the left navigation.
. Select the users tab from the top of the page then btn:[Organization Credentials].
. Make a note of your **Mirroring credentials**.
. Back in the {productname} {webui} enter your [guimenu]``Username`` and [guimenu]``Password``, and confirm with btn:[Save].

When the credentials are confirmed with a green check-mark icon, proceed with <<proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync>>.


[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the [guimenu]``SUSE Products`` tab.
  If you recently registered with {scc} a list of products will begin populating the table.
  This operation could take up to a few minutes.
  You can monitor the progress of the operation in section on the right ``Refresh the product catalog from SUSE Customer Center``.
  The table of products lists architecture, channels, and status information.
  For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].
+
image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Use the ``Filter by product description`` and ``Filter by architecture`` to filter the list of displayed products.
  The channels listed on the btn:[Products] page provide repositories for clients.
+

* Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
  Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Click btn:[Add Products] at the top of the page to start product synchronization.

After adding the channel, {productname} will schedule the channel to be synchronized.
This can take a long time as {productname} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scc} to the local [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory of your server.

When the channel is fully synchronized, a bootstrap repository for it will be automatically generated.
This step is crucial for successfully bootstrapping clients, ensuring that the channel synchronization and distribution are operational on the client side. This completes the installation and configuration of {productname}, along with preparing the channels necessary for bootstrapping clients.

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can proceed with registering the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy or additional clients.

For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
