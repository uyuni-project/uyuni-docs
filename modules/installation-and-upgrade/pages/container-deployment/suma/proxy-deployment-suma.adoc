= {productname} Proxy Deployment on {sle-micro}
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
:noindex:
endif::[]


This guide outlines the deployment process for the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sle-micro} is only supported as regular minion ([systemitem]``default`` contact method) for the time being.
We are working on managing it as Salt SSH client ([systemitem]``salt-ssh`` contact method), too.
====


To successfully deploy, you will perform the following actions:


// Add certificate tasks item
.Procedure: Deploying Proxy
. Review hardware requirements.
. Synchronize the {sle-micro} {microversion} parent channel and the proxy extension child channel on the server.
. Install {sle-micro} {microversion} on a bare-metal machine.
. During the installation, register {sle-micro} {microversion} along with the {productname} Proxy extension.
. Create a {salt} activation key.
. Bootstrap the proxy as a client with the [systemitem]``default`` connection method.
. Generate a proxy configuration.
. Transfer the proxy configuration from server to proxy.
. Use the proxy configuration to register the client as a proxy with {productname}.


.Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {sle-micro} {microversion}.

Container host::
A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers.
These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight.
This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments.
The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.

image::setup-wizard.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Synchronizing the Parent Channel and Proxy Extension
. In the {productname} {webui} select menu:Admin[Products].
. From the products page enter {sle-micro} in the filter field.
. Next use the drop-down to select the required architecture.
  For this example {x86_64}.
. In the [systemitem]``Product Description`` field select the {sle-micro} {microversion} checkbox then use the drop-down to select the [systemitem]``SUSE Manager Proxy Extension 5.0 x86_64`` extension.
. Click the btn:[Add products] button.
. Wait for the synchronization to complete.



== {sle-micro} {microversion} Installation

.Procedure: Downloading the Installation Media
. Locate the {sle-micro} {microversion} installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/.
. You will need an account with {scclongform} and must be logged in to download the ISO.
. Download [filename]``SLE-Micro-5.5-DVD-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso``.
. Prepare a USB flash disk or DVD for installation.
. Insert a DVD or a bootable USB stick containing the installation image for {sle-micro} {microversion}.
. Boot or reboot your system.


For detailed documentation on preparing your machines OS (virtual or physical), see link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.5/html/SLE-Micro-all/book-deployment-slemicro.html[{sle-micro} {microversion} Deployment Guide].


.Procedure: Installing {sle-micro} {microversion}
. Use the arrow keys to select [systemitem]``Installation``.
. Adjust Keyboard and language.
  Click the [systemitem]``checkbox`` to accept the license agreement.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Select your registration method.
  For this example, we will register the proxy with {scclongform}.
+

.{productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an extension
[NOTE]
====
The {productname} {productnumber} Proxy is registered as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring an {scclongform} registration key for {sle-micro} {microversion}, you will also need an {scclongform} registration code for the following extension:

* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
====

. Enter your {scclongform} Email address.
. Enter your registration code for {sle-micro} {microversion}.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``Extension and Module Selection`` page uncheck the **Hide Development Versions** checkbox.
. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension registration code.
. Click btn:[Next] to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``NTP Configuration`` page click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Authentication for the System`` page enter a password for the root user.
  Click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` page click btn:[Install].

This finalizes installation of {sle-micro} {microversion} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an extension.



=== Update the System


.Procedure: Updating the System
. Log in as *root*.
. Run **transactional-update**:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot the system.
. Log in as root.
. Install the container utilities:
+
[source, shell]
----
transactional-update pkg install mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion
----
+
* Alternatively you may install [systemitem]``mgrpxy-zsh-completion`` or [systemitem]``mgrpxy-fish-completion``.
+
. Reboot the system.



=== Configure Custom Persistent Storage

This step is optional.
However, if custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the [command]``mgr-storage-proxy`` tool.
This tool simplifies creating the container storage and Squid cache volumes.

Use the command in the following manner:
----
mgr-storage-proxy <storage-disk-device>
----

For example:
----
mgr-storage-proxy /dev/nvme1n1
----

For more information, type:
----
mgr-storage-proxy --help
----


[NOTE]
====
This command will create the persistent storage volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.

For more information, see

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[]
* xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-container-full-disk.adoc[]

[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-start]]
== Start the {productname} Proxy

Container can now be started with the [literal]`mgrpxy` command:

[[proc-setup-containers-setup-start]]
.Procedure: Starting and Checking Proxy Status

. Start the proxy by calling:
+
----
mgrpxy start
----
. Check container status by calling:
+
----
mgrpxy status
----
+
Five {productname} Proxy containers should be present and should be part of the [literal]``proxy-pod`` container pod:

* proxy-salt-broker
* proxy-httpd
* proxy-tftpd
* proxy-squid
* proxy-ssh


////
[[installation-proxy-containers-services]]
== Install container services on the host system
ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

[NOTE]
====
[literal]``Containers Module`` is required to be available for container host on a {sles} machine.
====
endif::[]

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

First step is to install the [literal]``mgrpxy`` utility provided by the package of the same name.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
The [literal]``mgrpxy`` package is available in the {productname} Proxy product repositories.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
The [literal]``mgrpxy`` package is available in the container utils repository: pick the one matching the distribution in: https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/.
endif::[]

To install them run:

----
zypper in helm mgrpxy
----
////


=== Using a Custom Container Image for a Service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is configured to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with [literal]``-tag`` and [literal]``-image``.

For example:
----
mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds`` is the image to use and [literal]``0.1.0`` is the version tag, before restarting it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters:
----
mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.

[[installation-proxy-containers-firewall-rules]]
== Allow network access for provided services on container host firewall


{productname} Proxy containers work as so called node-port service.
This means proxy container pod shares container host network TCP and UDP port space.
For this reason container host firewall must be configured to accept incoming traffic on ports used by {productname} Proxy containers.
Those ports are:

- 69/UDP - TFTP
- 80/TCP - HTTP
- 443/TCP - HTTPS
- 4505/TCP - Salt
- 4506/TCP - Salt
- 8022/TCP - SSH

Continue with setting up the installed {productname} Proxy as a containers at xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/suma/proxy-container-setup.adoc[].
