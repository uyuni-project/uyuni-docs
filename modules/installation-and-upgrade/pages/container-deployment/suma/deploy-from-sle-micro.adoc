= Deploy {productname} {productnumber} as a container using {micro}

In this section, you will gain expertise in setting up and deploying a containerized {productname} {productnumber} Server.
This process encompasses the installation of {micro}, and then initiating interaction with the container through the [command]``mgradm`` and [command]``mgrctl`` commands.


== Container Host general Requirements

For general requirements see, xref:installation-and-upgrade:general-requirements.adoc[General requirements]

A {micro} or {sles} server should be installed from installation media.
This procedure is described below.

[[installation-server-containers-requirements]]
== Container Host Requirements

For CPU, RAM and storage requirements see, xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc[Hardware requirements]


[IMPORTANT]
====
To guarantee that clients can resolve the {productname} {productnumber} domain name, both the container server and host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups.
====


== {micro} {microversion} Installation

Get a copy of the {micro} {microversion} install media. You can begin installation on either a virtual machine or on a physical server. 


.Procedure: {micro} {microversion} installation
. Begin installation from media

. Adjust Keyboard and language. Click the [systemitem]``checkbox`` to accept the License Agreement.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Select your registration method. For this example we will register the sever with {scc}.

. Enter your {scc} Email address. 

. Enter your registration code for {micro} {microversion}.
+

.Base operating system for {productname} {productnumber} Server
[NOTE]
====
For SUSE Manager 5.0, the base operating system of the container is {micro} {microversion}
You can find these keys from your {scc} account.
====

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Server extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Server extension registration code.
+

.{productname} as an extension
[NOTE]
====
{productname} {productnumber} is installed as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring {scc} registration keys for the base Server, you will also need {scc} registration codes for the following extensions:

* {productname} {productnumber} Server
* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
* Retail Branch Server

====
+

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Enter or accept default [systemitem]``NTP Server``.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Add the [systemitem]``root user`` password twice to confirm.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Adjust [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` as required.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

This concludes installation of {micro} {microversion}.



== Deploy {productname} {productnumber} as container on {micro} {microversion}


=== Basic and advanced deployment with mgradm

.Procedure: Basic deployment of a {productname} {productnumber} container with Podman
. from the terminal run the following command as the root user.
+

[source, shell]
----
sudo mgradm install podman
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step.

[source, shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====
+

. Enter your servers FQDN.

. Enter a database and certificate password when prompted.

. Wait for deployment to complete.

. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.

In this section you learned the basic method for deploying a {productname} {productnumber} Server container.


.Procedure: Advanced - Deploy {productname} {productnumber} using a custom configuration file
. Prepare an mgradm.yaml file similar to the following example:
+

[source, yaml]
----
# Database password
db:
  password: MySuperSecretDBPass
# Certifcate password
cert:
  password: MySuperSecretCAPass
# SSL password
ssl:
  password: MySuperSecretSllPassword

# If you have these you can provide them to setup your oganization credentials
scc: 
  user: ccUsername
  password: ccPassword

# Adminstrators email
email: email@example.com
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For security, **using command line parameters to specify passwords should be avoided**: use a configuration file with proper permissions instead.
====
+

. from the terminal run the following command a the sudo user. Replace `uyuni.example.com` with your FQDN.
+

[source, shell]
----
sudo mgradm -c mgradm.yaml install podman <FQDN>
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step.

[source, shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====

. Wait for deployment to complete.

. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.

In this section you learned how to deploy an {productname} Server container.

=== Persistent volumes

[NOTE]
====
If you are just testing out {productname} you do not need to specify these volumes. [command]``mgradm`` will setup the correct volumes by default.

Specifiying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments.
====

Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes.



By default [command]``Podman`` stores its volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``. 

You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``.
This is especially important for the database and package mirrors. 

For a list of all persistent volumes in the container see,  xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[Persistent container volumes]
