= Deploy {productname} {productnumber} as a container using {micro} {microversion}
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
:noindex:
endif::[]

In this section, you will gain expertise in setting up and deploying a containerized {productname} {productnumber} Server.
This process installs {micro}, and then interacts with the container through the
container utilities [command]``mgradm`` and [command]``mgrctl``.


== Container Host general Requirements

For general requirements, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:general-requirements.adoc[].

A {micro} or {sles} server should be installed from installation media.
This procedure is described below.

[[installation-server-containers-requirements]]
== Container Host Requirements

For CPU, RAM, and storage requirements, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
To guarantee that clients can resolve the {productname} {productnumber} domain name, both the container server and host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups.
====


== {micro} {microversion} Installation

Get a copy of the {micro} {microversion} installation media.
You can begin the installation on either a virtual machine or on a physical server.


.Procedure: {micro} {microversion} installation
. Begin the installation from the installation media.

. Adjust keyboard and language.
  Click the [systemitem]``checkbox`` to accept the license agreement.

. Click btn:[Next] to continue.

. Select your registration method.
  For this example, we will register the sever with the {scc}.

. Enter your {scc} email address.

. Enter your registration code for {micro} {microversion}.
+

.Base operating system for {productname} {productnumber} containerized Server
[NOTE]
====
For SUSE Manager 5.0, the base operating system of the container is {sles} {bci-suma}.
You can find these keys in your {scc} account.
====

. Decide if you would like to activate online repositories or not.

. Click btn:[Next] to continue.

. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Server extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Server extension registration code.
+

.{productname} as an extension
[NOTE]
====
{productname} {productnumber} is installed as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring {scc} registration keys for the base Server, you will also need {scc} registration codes for the following extensions:

* {productname} {productnumber} Server
* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
* Retail Branch Server

====
+

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Enter or accept default [systemitem]``NTP Server``.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Add the [systemitem]``root user`` password twice to confirm.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

. Adjust [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` as required.

. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.

This concludes the installation of {micro} {microversion}.



== Update the Container Host

When the installation completes, update the container host system.

.Procedure: Update the container host and install the container utilities

. Log in at the prompt as *root*.

. Run **transactional-update**:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot the system.

. Log in as root.

. Install the container utilities:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update pkg install mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion
----
+

. Reboot the system.


== Deploy {productname} {productnumber} as container on {micro} {microversion}


=== Basic and advanced deployment with mgradm

.Procedure: Basic deployment of a {productname} {productnumber} container with Podman
. From the terminal of the container host, run the following command as the root user.
  Entering your server's FQDN is optional.
  Leave blank for a default setup.
+

[source, shell]
----
mgradm install podman <FQDN>
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed on the terminal if you miss this step.

[source, shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====
+

. Enter a database and certificate password when prompted. Press btn:[Enter].

. Enter a certificate and administrator account password when prompted.
+

[NOTE]
====
The administrator account password must be at least 5 characters and less
than 48 characters in length.
====
+

. Press btn:[Enter].

. Wait for deployment to complete.

. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN, or IP address.

In this section you learned the basic method for deploying a {productname} {productnumber} Server container.


.Procedure: Advanced deployment of a {productname} {productnumber} container using a custom configuration file
. Prepare a configuration file named [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` similar to the following example:
+

[source, yaml]
----
# Database password. Randomly generated by default
db:
  password: MySuperSecretDBPass

# Password for the CA certificate
ssl:
  password: MySuperSecretSSLPassword

# Your SUSE Customer Center credentials
scc: 
  user: ccUsername
  password: ccPassword

# Organization name
organization: YourOrganization

# Email address sending the notifications
emailFrom: notifications@example.com

# Administrators account details
admin:
  password: MySuperSecretAdminPass
  login: LoginName
  firstName: Admin
  lastName: Admin
  email: email@example.com
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
For security, **using command line parameters to specify passwords should be avoided**: use a configuration file with proper permissions instead.
====
+

. From the terminal, run the following command as the root user.
  Entering your server's FQDN is optional.
+

[source, shell]
----
mgradm -c mgradm.yaml install podman <FQDN>
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step.

[source, shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====

. Wait for deployment to complete.

. Open a browser and proceed to your server's FQDN or IP address.

In this section you learned how to deploy a {productname} Server container.

=== Persistent volumes

[NOTE]
====
If you are just testing out {productname} you do not need to specify these volumes. [command]``mgradm`` will setup the correct volumes by default.

Specifying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments.
====

Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes.



By default, [command]``Podman`` stores its volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``. 

You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``.
This is especially important for the database and package mirrors. 

For a list of all persistent volumes in the container see, xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[Persistent container volumes].


== Container Management
To begin managing your containers, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/container-management.adoc[Container management].
