== Available Images

[IMPORTANT]
====
The preferred method for deploying {productname} {productnumber} Proxy is to use one of the following available images.
All tools are included in these images greatly simplifying deployment.
====

Images for {productname} {productnumber} Proxy are available at link:https://www.suse.com/download/suse-manager/[{productname} {productnumber} VM images].

[[proxy-quickstart.sect.vmware.settings]]
== Virtual Machine Settings - VMware

This sections describes VMware configurations, focusing on the creation of an extra virtual disk essential for the {productname} Proxy storage partition within VMware environments.


.Procedure: Creating the VMware Virtual Machine

. Download {productname} Proxy [filename]``.vmdk`` file then transfer a copy to your VMware storage.

. Make a copy of uploaded [filename]``.vmdk`` file using VMware web interface.
  This will convert provided [filename]``.vmdk`` file to the format suitable for vSpere hypervisor.

. Create and name a new virtual machine based on the Guest OS Family [systemitem]``Linux`` and Guest OS Version {sle} 15 (64-bit).

. Add an additional [systemitem]``Hard Disk 2`` of 500 GB (or more).

. Configure RAM and number of CPUs (at least 16 GB RAM and 4 CPUs).

. Set the network adapter as required.

. Power on the VM, and follow firstboot dialogs (keyboard layout, license agreement, time zone, password for root).

. When installation completes log in as root.

. Proceed to the next section.



[[minimal.susemgr.prep]]
== Register {sle-micro} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy

// Before starting obtain your SUSE Manager Registration Code from SUSE Customer Center - https://scc.suse.com.

.Procedure: Registering {sle-micro} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
. Boot the virtual machine.
. Log in as `root`.
. Register {sle-micro} with SCC.
+

----
transactional-update register -r <REGCODE> -e <your_email>
----

. Reboot.

. Register {productname} {productnumber} Proxy with {scc}.
+

----
transactional-update register -p SUSE-Manager-Proxy/5.0/x86_64 -r <REGCODE>
----

. Reboot

. Update the system:
+

----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied reboot.

. This step is optional.
  However, if custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the [command]``mgr-storage-proxy`` tool.
** For more information, see [command]``mgr-storage-proxy --help``.
This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes.

** Use the command in the following manner:
+

----
mgr-storage-proxy <storage-disk-device>
----
+
For example:
+
----
mgr-storage-proxy /dev/nvme1n1
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This command will move the persistent storage volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes`` to the specified storage device.

For more information, see

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[]
* xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-container-full-disk.adoc[]

== Create an Activation Key for the Proxy

On the {productname} server, create an activation key for the Proxy.

.Task: Create an Activation Key
. Navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys], and click btn:[Create key].
. Create an activation key for the proxy host with {sle-micro} {microversion} as the parent channel.
  This key should include all recommended channels and the Proxy as an extension child channel.
. Proceed to boostrapping the proxy host as a minion.



== Bootstrap the Proxy Host

.Task: Bootstrap the Proxy Host
. Select menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. Fill in the fields for your proxy host.
. Select the Activation key created in the previous step from the dropdown.
. Click btn:[Bootstrap].
. Wait for the Bootstrap process to complete successfully.
  Check the menu:Salt[] menu and confirm the {salt} key is listed and accepted.
. Reboot the proxy host.
. Select the host from the menu:System[] list and trigger a second reboot after all events are finished to conclude the onboarding.


.Task: Update the Proxy Host
. Select the host from the menu:Systems[] list and apply all patches to update it.
. Reboot the proxy host.

[[proxy-vm-setup-containers-transfer-config]]
== Transfer the Proxy Configuration

The {webui} generates a configuration archive.
This archive needs to be made available on the proxy container host.


.Procedure: Copying the Proxy Configuration
. Copy the files from the Server container to the Server host OS:
+
----
mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz .
----

. Next copy the files from the Server host OS to the Proxy host:
+
----
scp config.tar.gz <proxy-FQDN>:/root
----

. Install the Proxy with:
+

----
mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz
----



[[proxy-vm-setup-containers-transfer-start]]
== Start the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy

Container can now be started with the [literal]`mgrpxy` command:

[[proc-proxy-vm-setup-containers-setup-start]]
.Procedure: Start and Check Proxy Status

. Start the Proxy by calling:
+

----
mgrpxy start
----

. Check container status by calling:
+

----
mgrpxy status
----
+

Five {productname} Proxy containers should be present:

- proxy-salt-broker
- proxy-httpd
- proxy-tftpd
- proxy-squid
- proxy-ssh

And should be part of the [literal]``proxy-pod`` container pod.


=== Using a Custom Container Image for a Service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with [literal]``-tag`` and [literal]``-image``.

For example, use it like this:

----
mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds`` is the image to use and [literal]``0.1.0`` is the version tag, before restarting it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters:

----
mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.
