== What is Air-gapped Deployment?


Air-gapped deployment refers to the setup and operation of any networked system that is physically isolated from insecure networks, especially the internet. This type of deployment is commonly used in high-security environments such as military installations, financial systems, critical infrastructure, and anywhere sensitive data is handled and must be protected from external threats.

You can easily deploy container images using [systemitem]``Podman``, [systemitem]``Docker``, or [systemitem]``Skopeo`` on a machine with internet access. 

.Procedure
. Pull the desired image, then save the image as a [literal]``tar`` archive. 
For example:
+
.Podman
----
podman pull registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest
podman save --output server.tar registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest
----
+
.Docker
----
docker pull registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest
docker save --output server.tar registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest
----
+
.Skopeo
----
skopeo copy docker://registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest docker-archive:server.tar:registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/server:latest
----
+
. Transfer the resulting [filename]``server-image.tar`` to the Server container host and load it using the following command:
+
.Load the server image
----
podman load -i server.tar
----

=== Deploy {productname} on {leapmicro}

{productname} also provides all the needed container images in RPM packages that can be installed on the system.

[NOTE]
====
User should make the needed RPM available on the internal network. That can be done by using a second {productname} Server or any kind of mirror.
====

.Procedure: Install {productname} on {leapmicro} in Air-gapped
. Install {leapmicro}.
. Update the system.
. Install tools packages and image packages (replace $ARCH$ with the correct architecture):

+

[source,shell]
----
transactional-update pkg install mgradm* mgrctl* uyuni-server*-image*
----
+
. Reboot.
. Deploy {productname} with [command]``mgradm``. In an Air-gapped environment you may want to use the option [command]``--pullPolicy Never``.


For more detailed information about installing {productname} Server on {leapmicro}, see xref:container-deployment/uyuni/server-deployment-uyuni.adoc[Server Deployment].

To upgrade {productname} Server, users should upgrade all packages in the system and follow the procedures defined in xref:container-management/updating-server-containers.adoc[Server Upgrade].
