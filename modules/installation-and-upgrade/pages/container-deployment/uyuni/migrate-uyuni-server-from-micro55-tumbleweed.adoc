This page describes a simple, backup-and-restore migration of a {productname} Server running on SUSE Micro 5.5 to a fresh host running openSUSE Tumbleweed as the base OS.


== Overview of the Migration Process

You will:

* Create a full server backup with [command]``mgradm backup`` on the openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 host.
* Reinstall the host with openSUSE Tumbleweed (server profile).
* Install {productname} tools and prerequisites on Tumbleweed.
* Restore the backup with [command]``mgradm backup restore``.
* Start services and verify the server.


== Requirements and Considerations

* Source server: openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 running {productname} (for example: {productnumber}).
* Target server: openSUSE Tumbleweed with the same hostname/FQDN and IP (recommended) to avoid client-side changes.
* SSH/scp access between machines for transferring the backup tarball.
* Sufficient free disk space on both source and target for the backup and restore.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Restore to the same {productname} version you backed up, or a version explicitly documented as compatible for restore. If you use development or preview repositories (for example, Uyuni Master), expect changes and re-validate.
====

== Migration Procedure

=== Step 1: Create a Backup on the openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 Server
.Procedure:  Create a Backup
[role="procedure"]
____
. As root on the old server, create a backup directory and run the backup:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgradm backup /tmp/uyuni-backup
----
. Package the backup for transfer:

+

[source,shell]
----
tar -C /tmp -cvf /tmp/uyuni-backup.tar uyuni-backup
----
. Copy the backup to a safe location you can reach from the new host:

+

[source,shell]
----
scp /tmp/uyuni-backup.tar <USER>@<HOST>:/path/to/store/
----

[TIP]
====
You can store the backup to external storage or an object store as long as you can fetch it on the new host.
====

____

=== Step 2: Reinstall the Host with openSUSE Tumbleweed
.Procedure: Reinstalling the Host
[role="procedure"]
____

. Reprovision the VM or bare-metal host with openSUSE Tumbleweed.
. Choose a basic “server profile” installation.
. Set the same hostname/FQDN and IP address as the original server if you want clients to reconnect seamlessly.

____

=== Step 3: Install {productname} Tools and Prerequisites on Tumbleweed

.Procedure: Installing Tools and Prerequisites
[role="procedure"]
____

. Add the Uyuni Stable repository and install tools:
+
[source,shell]
----
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-x86_64-Media1 uyuni-server-stable
zypper ref
zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion uyuni-storage-setup-server
----
. Install Podman if it was not automatically pulled in:

+

[source,shell]
----
zypper in podman
----

[NOTE]
====
The package [package]``uyuni-storage-setup-server`` provides the [command]``mgr-storage-server`` tool for preparing persistent volumes. Installing [package]``podman`` explicitly may be necessary on some installations.
====

____

=== Step 4: Optional - Prepare Persistent Storage

.Procedure: Prepareing Persistent Storage
[role="procedure"]
____

It is recommended to configure persistent storage with [command]``mgr-storage-server`` to avoid container full-disk issues.

[source,shell]
----
mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>]
----

[NOTE]
====
Devices must be raw (no existing filesystem). The tool creates volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.

For details, see:

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[]
* xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-container-full-disk.adoc[]
====

____

=== Step 5 Fetch and Restore the Backup on Tumbleweed

.Procedure: Fetching and Restoring the Backup
[role="procedure"]
____

. Copy the backup to the new server and unpack it:

+

[source,shell]
----
scp <USER>@<HOST>:/path/to/store/uyuni-backup.tar /tmp/
tar -C /tmp -xvf /tmp/uyuni-backup.tar
----
. Restore using [command]``mgradm`` (point to the extracted backup directory):

+

[source,shell]
----
mgradm backup restore /tmp/uyuni-backup
----

____

=== Step 6: Start Services and Verify

.Procedure: Starting Services and Verifying

. Start the server services:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgradm start
----
. Verify:
** Check that all containers are up: [command]``mgrctl ps`` or [command]``podman ps``.
** Access the Web UI (HTTPS) and log in.
** Review logs for errors: [command]``mgrctl logs server`` and other components as needed.

___

== Notes and Troubleshooting

* If Podman wasn’t installed automatically, install it with [command]``zypper in podman`` and rerun the restore/start steps.
* Ensure the target host has the same time, hostname, and IP configuration expected by your setup (especially if clients exist).
* For large environments, ensure adequate disk throughput and space. The backup and restore can take a long time.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the restore fails or the new system cannot start, you can still boot the original openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 system and continue service. Keep the original VM/snapshots until you fully validate the new Tumbleweed-based server.
