= Containerized {productname} Proxy Setup
ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
:noindex:
endif::[]

Once container host for {productname} Proxy containers is prepared, setup of containers require few additional steps to finish configuration.

1. Generate {productname} Proxy configuration archive file
2. Transfer configuration archive to the container host prepared in installation step and extract it
3. Start the proxy sevices with [literal]``mgrpxy``



[[proxy-setup-containers-generate-config]]
== Create and generate {productname} Proxy configuration

Configuration of {productname} Proxy is generated by {productname} Server and this configuration generation is required to be done for each containerized proxy.
There are two ways how to generate {productname} configuration: use the {webui} or the [literal]``spacecmd`` command.


[[proc-proxy-containers-setup-webui]]
.Procedure: Generating Of Container Services Configuration using Web UI

. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Proxy Configuration] and fill the required data:

. In the [guimenu]``Proxy FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy.

. In the [guimenu]``Parent FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the {productname} Server or another {productname} Proxy.

. In the [guimenu]``Proxy SSH port`` field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on {productname} Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022.

. In the [guimenu]``Max Squid cache size [MB]`` field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Typically this should be at most 60% of available storage for the containers.

. In the [guimenu]``SSL certificate`` selection list choose [literal]``Use existing``.

. Click btn:[Generate] to register new proxy FQDN in {productname} Server and generate configuration archive with details for container host.

. After a few moments you are presented with file to download. Save this file locally.

[[proc-proxy-containers-setup-spacecmd]]
.Procedure: Generating Container Services Configuration with [command]``spacecmd``

. In the console run following command:
+
----
spacecmd proxy_container_config -- <proxy_fqdn> <parent_fqdn> <squid_max_cache> <admin_email>
----

. Answer questions presented by script, namely {productname} credentials and CA password.
+
This will generate file `config.tar.gz` with configuration for the {productname} Proxy containers.
+
For more information about [literal]`spacecmd` container proxy generation, see xref:reference:spacecmd/proxy_container.adoc[].


If a [literal]``Proxy FQDN`` is used to generate {productname} Proxy container configuration that is not a registered minion, a new system entry will appear in system list.
This new entry will be shown under previously entered [literal]``Proxy FQDN`` value and will be of [literal]``Foreign`` system type.


[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-config]]
== Transfer {productname} Proxy configuration

Both [command]``spacecmd`` command  and {webui} ways generate a configuration archive.
This archive needs to be made available on container host.

Transfer this generated archive to the container host.

For installation instructions to use the archive to get the proxy containers, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/uyuni/proxy-container-installation-uyuni.adoc[].

[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-start]]
== Start {productname} Proxy containers

Container can now be started with the [literal]`mgrpxy` command:

[[proc-setup-containers-setup-start]]
.Procedure: Start {productname} Proxy containers

----
mgrpxy start uyuni-proxy-pod
----

Check if all containers started up as expected by calling

----
podman ps
----

Five {productname} Proxy containers should be present:

- proxy-salt-broker
- proxy-httpd
- proxy-tftpd
- proxy-squid
- proxy-ssh

And should be part of [literal]``proxy-pod`` container pod.
