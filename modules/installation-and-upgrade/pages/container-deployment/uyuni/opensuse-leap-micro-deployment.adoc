== Deployment preparations

In this section, you will gain expertise in setting up and deploying a {productname} Server.
The process encompasses the installation of [command]``Podman``, [systemitem]``Uyuni container utilities``, deployment, and then initiating interaction with the container through [command]``mgrctl``.

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes you have already configured an {leapmicro} {microversion} host server, whether it is running on a physical machine or within a virtual environment.
====

== Container Host general requirements

For general requirements, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:general-requirements.adoc[General requirements].

An {leapmicro} {microversion} server should be installed from installation media.
This procedure is described below.

[[installation-server-containers-requirements]]
== Container Host Requirements

For CPU, RAM, and storage requirements, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc[Hardware requirements].


[IMPORTANT]
====
To guarantee that clients can resolve the FQDN domain name, both the containerized server and the host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups.
====

== Update the host


== Installing Uyuni tools for use with containers


.Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on {leapmicro} {microversion}
. On your local host open a terminal window or start up a virtual machine running {leapmicro} {microversion}.

. Login.

. Enter the [command]``transactional-update shell``:
+

----
transactional-update shell
----
+

. Add the following repository to your {leapmicro} {microversion} server:
+

----
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Leap_Micro_5.5/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Stable:ContainerUtils.repo
----
+

. Refresh the repository list and accept the key:
+
----
zypper ref
----
+

. Install the container tools:
+

[source, shell]
----
zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion netavark
----
+

. Exit the transactional shell:
+
----
transactional update # exit
----

. Reboot the host.

== Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman



=== mgradm overview

{productname} is deployed as a container using the [command]``mgradm`` tool.
There are two methods of deploying a {productname} server as a container. 
In this section we will focus on basic container deployment.

For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/mgradm-yaml-custom-configuration.adoc[].


For additional information, you can explore further by running [command]``mgradm --help`` from the command line.


.Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman
. From the terminal run the following command as the sudo user or as root.
+

[source, shell]
----
sudo mgradm install podman
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step.

[source, shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====

. Wait for deployment to complete.

. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.

In this section you learned how to deploy an {productname} Server container.



=== Persistent volumes

Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes.

[NOTE]
====
If you are just testing out {productname} you do not need to specify these volumes. [command]``mgradm`` will setup the correct volumes by default.

Specifying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments.
====

By default [command]``podman`` stores its volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``. 

You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``. This is especially important for the database and package mirrors. 

For a list of all persistent volumes in the container, see  xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[].
