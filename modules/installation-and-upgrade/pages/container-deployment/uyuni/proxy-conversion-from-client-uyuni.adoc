= Proxy conversion from client

== Introduction

This chapter describes how {productname} proxy can be registered with {productname} server from the {webui}.

The client which is a candidate for conversion to proxy must adhere to the following pre-requisites:

* it must already be onboarded
* it is reachable
* it has access to client tools 
* it has access to proxy channels

== Convert the client to {productname} Proxy

The process of conversion is done entirely from the {webui} for already registered clients. 
For more information about client onboarding, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].

The following two procedures describe the client conversion to a proxy.
Either procedure can be used, and will achieve the same outcome.

.Procedure: Converting client to {productname} Proxy using dedicated button
. For the client chosen to be converted to proxy, go to its [literal]``Overview`` page.
. Click button btn:[Convert to Proxy].
. Wait for the conversion to complete.
. Confirm that the conversion has been successful by locating a new tab [literal]``Proxy`` on the [literal]``Overview`` page.
. Confirm there are two tabs within [literal]``Proxy``: [literal]``Clients`` and [literal]``Configuration``.

Proceed with the steps to <<configure-proxy>>.

.Procedure: Converting client to {productname} Proxy by changing client's properties
. For the client chosen to be converted to proxy, go to its [literal]``Properties`` page.
. Locate the section [literal]``Add-on System Types``.
. Check the option [literal]``Proxy``.
. Click button btn:[Update Properties].
. Follow the displayed note and apply highstate to complete the conversion.
. Confirm that the conversion has been successful by locating a new tab [literal]``Proxy`` on the [literal]``Overview`` page.
. Confirm there are two tabs within [literal]``Proxy``, [literal]``Clients`` and [literal]``Configuration``.

Proceed with the steps to <<configure-proxy>>.


[[configure-proxy]]
== Configure the Proxy

Once the client had been succesfully converted to proxy, it needs to be configured.

.Procedure: Configuring the Proxy 
. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Proxy[Configuration] and fill in the required data:
. In the [guimenu]``Parent FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the parent server or proxy.
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy SSH port`` field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on {productname} Proxy. It is recommended to keep default 8022.
. In the [guimenu]``Max Squid cache size [MB]`` field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache.
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy admin email`` field type the administrator's email.
. In the section [literal]``Certificates`` select one of two options: [literal]``Keep`` or [literal]``Replace``.
* Select [literal]``Keep`` if an existing certificates should be used. 
   This option is not available when you configure the proxy for the first time.
* Select [literal]``Replace`` if the new server certificates should be provided for {productname} proxy.
+
The certificate can be replaced by one of the two options:
+
** an existing certificate, provided by the third-party authority
** a brand new certificate generated from the existing {productname} CA certificate for the proxy, by using command [command]``rhn-ssl-tool``
+
For more information about certificate creation, see xref:administration:ssl-certs.adoc[].
. In the section [literal]``Source`` select one of two options: [literal]``RPM`` or [literal]``Registry``.
+
. Option [literal]``RPM`` is recommended for air-gapped or restricted environments.
+ 

[WARNING]
====
If [literal]``RPM`` option is selected, a number of packages must be installed before proceeding further.
====

+
Go to [literal]``Software`` tab, search and install the following packages (the example illustrates the use of [literal]``x86_64`` architecture):

* uyuni-proxy-httpd-image
* uyuni-proxy-salt-broker-image
* uyuni-proxy-squid-image
* uyuni-proxy-ssh-image
* uyuni-proxy-tftpd-image

+

Return to Proxy configuration tab, and continue with the remaining configuration.
 
. Option [literal]``Registry`` can be used if connectivity is available.
+
For more information about deployment in air-gapped environment, see  xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/proxy-air-gapped-deployment-mlm.adoc[].

. In case [literal]``Registry`` is selected, proceed with selecting one of two options: [literal]``Simple`` or [literal]``Advanced``.
. If the option selected is [literal]``Simple``, provide the values in [literal]``Registry URL`` and [literal]``Containers Tag``.
+
* For [literal]``Registry URL`` use [literal]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni``.
* Select the tag from the drop-down list.

. If the option selected is [literal]``Advanced`` additional section of the form opens.
+
*  For every indivudual URL field, use the registry [literal]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni`` and the corresponding suffix, or example _proxy-httpd_ or _salt-broker_.
* Select the tag from the drop-down list.
. Once all fields are filled in, click btn:[Apply] to apply the changes.


[WARNING]
====
When configuring a proxy chain, the parent proxy needs access to any registry that a child proxy is set to use as its source.
