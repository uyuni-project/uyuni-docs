= Deploy a {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
:noindex:
endif::[]


This guide outlines the deployment process for the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy.
This guide presumes you have already successfully deployed a {productname} {productnumber} Server. 
To successfully deploy, you will perform the following actions:


.Checklist: Proxy Deployment
. Review hardware requirements.
. Synchronize the {leapmicro} {microversion} parent channel and the Proxy extension child channel on the server.
. Install {leapmicro} {microversion} on a bare-metal machine.
. During the installation, register {leapmicro} {microversion} along with the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension.
. Create a {salt} activation key.
. Bootstrap the Proxy as a {salt} minion.
. Generate a Proxy configuration.
. Transfer the Proxy configuration from Server to Proxy
. Use the Proxy configuration to register the {salt} minion as a Proxy with {productname}.


.Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {leapmicro} {microversion}.

Container host:: A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.

.{productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an extension
[NOTE]
====
The {productname} {productnumber} Proxy is registered as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring an {scc} registration key for {micro} {microversion}, you will also need an {scc} registration code for the following extension:

* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
====

. Enter your {scc} Email address. 
. Enter your registration code for {micro} {microversion}.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``Extension and Module Selection`` page uncheck the **Hide Development Versions** checkbox. 
. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension registration code.
. Click btn:[Next] to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``NTP Configuration`` page click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Authentication for the System`` page enter a password for the root user. Click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` page click btn:[Install].

This concludes installation of {micro} {microversion} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an extension.



=== Update the system


.Task: Update the System
. Login as *root*.
. Run **transactional-update**:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot the system.
. Login as root.
. Install the container utilities:
+

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively you may install [systemitem]``mgrpxy-zsh-completion`` or [systemitem]``mgrpxy-fish-completion``.
====
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update pkg install mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion
----
+

. Reboot the system.



== Create an Activation Key for the Proxy

.Task: Create an Activation Key
. Select menu:Systems[Activation Keys] then click btn:[+ Create key].
. Create an activation key for the proxy host with {micro} {microversion} as the parent channel. This key should include all recommended channels and the Proxy as an extension child channel.
. Proceed to boostrapping the proxy host as a minion.



== Bootstrap the Proxy Host as a Minion

.Task: Bootstrap the Proxy Host
. Select menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
. Fill in the fields for your Proxy host.
. Select the Activation key created in the previous step from the dropdown.
. Click btn:[+ Bootstrap].
. Wait for the Bootstrap process to complete successfully.
  Check the menu:Salt[] menu and confirm the {salt} minion key is listed and accepted.
. Reboot the Proxy host.
. Select the host from the menu:System[] list and trigger a second reboot after all events are finished to conclude the onboarding.


.Task: Update the Proxy Host
. Select the host from the menu:Systems[] list and apply all patches to update it.
. Reboot the Proxy host.



[[proxy-setup-containers-generate-config]]
== Generate the Proxy Configuration

The configuration archive of the {productname} Proxy is generated by the {productname} Server. 
Each additional Proxy requires its own configuration archive.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The container host for the {productname} Proxy must be registered as a salt minion to the {productname} Server prior to generating this Proxy configuration.
====


You will perform the following tasks:

1. Generate a Proxy configuration file.
2. Transfer the configuration to the Proxy.
3. Start the Proxy with the [literal]``mgrpxy`` command.

[[proc-proxy-containers-setup-webui]]
.Task: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration using Web UI

. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Proxy Configuration] and fill the required data:
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy.
. In the [guimenu]``Parent FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the {productname} Server or another {productname} Proxy.
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy SSH port`` field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on {productname} Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022.
. In the [guimenu]``Max Squid cache size [MB]`` field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Typically this should be at most 60% of available storage for the containers.
. In the [guimenu]``SSL certificate`` selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for {productname} Proxy or an existing one should be used.
You can consider generated certificates as {productname} builtin (self signed) certificates.
+
Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate.
+
The CA certificates generated on the server are stored in the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/ssl-build`` directory.
+
For more information about existing or custom certificates and the concept of corporate and intermediate certificates, see  xref:administration:ssl-certs-imported.adoc[].

. Click btn:[Generate] to register new proxy FQDN in {productname} Server and generate configuration archive with details for container host.
. After a few moments you are presented with file to download. Save this file locally.

image::suma_proxy_containerized_webui.png[scaledwidth=80%]

[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-config]]
== Transfer the Proxy Configuration

The {webui} generates a configuration archive.
This archive needs to be made available on the Proxy container host.


.Task: Copy the Proxy configuration
. Copy the files from the Server container to the Server host OS:
+
----
mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz .
----

. Next copy the files from the Server host OS to the Proxy host: 
+
----
scp config.tar.gz <proxy-FQDN>:/root
----

. Install the Proxy with:
+ 

----
mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz
----



[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-start]]
== Start the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy

Container can now be started with the [literal]`mgrpxy` command:

[[proc-setup-containers-setup-start]]
.Task: Start and Check Proxy Status

. Start the Proxy by calling:
+

----
mgrpxy start
----

. Check container status by calling:
+

----
mgrpxy status
----
+

Five {productname} Proxy containers should be present:

- proxy-salt-broker
- proxy-httpd
- proxy-tftpd
- proxy-squid
- proxy-ssh

And should be part of the [literal]``proxy-pod`` container pod.



=== Using a custom container image for a service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with [literal]``-tag`` and [literal]``-image``.

For example, use it like this:

----
mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds`` is the image to use and [literal]``0.1.0`` is the version tag, before restarting it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters:

----
mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz
----

This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.
