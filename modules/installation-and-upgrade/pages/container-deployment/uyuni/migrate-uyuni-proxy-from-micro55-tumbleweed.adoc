This page describes how to migrate a {productname} Proxy host from SUSE Micro 5.5 to a fresh openSUSE Tumbleweed installation using the proxy administration tool [command]``mgrpxy``.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This guide was tested on Tumbleweed only. There is no known reason it wouldn’t work on other supported bases, but always validate in a test environment before production.
====



== Overview of the Proxy Migration Process

You will:

* Save proxy configuration from the old system (including Apache/Squid tuning).
* Reinstall the host with openSUSE Tumbleweed.
* Re-register the host using the system reactivation key.
* Install [command]``mgrpxy`` (and Podman if needed).
* Restore configuration and run [command]``mgrpxy install podman`` with optional tuning files.


== Requirements and Considerations

* Keep the same hostname/FQDN and IP when possible so the server and clients interact with the proxy as before.
* Ensure you have the “system reactivation key” for the existing proxy system (UI: Systems > select the proxy > Details > Reactivation).
* Ensure SSH/scp access to move configuration archives off and onto the machine.

== Migration Procedure

=== Step 1: Save Proxy Configuration and Tuning Files

.Procedure: Save Proxy Configuration and Tuning Files
[role="procedure"]
____

. Copy the Uyuni proxy configuration directory to a safe location:

+

[source,shell]
----
scp -r /etc/uyuni <USER>@<HOST>:/some/where/safe/
----
. Identify Apache and Squid tuning files currently in use by the legacy proxy services:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl cat uyuni-proxy-httpd.service | grep EXTRA_CONF= | sed 's/.*=-v\([^:]\+\):.*/\1/'
systemctl cat uyuni-proxy-squid.service | grep EXTRA_CONF= | sed 's/.*=-v\([^:]\+\):.*/\1/'
----
. Copy those tuning files to the same safe location as well.

[TIP]
====
Typical default paths after you copy them back will be:

* Apache tuning: [path]``/etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf``
* Squid tuning: [path]``/etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf``
====

=== Step 2: Reinstall the Host with openSUSE Tumbleweed
.Procedure: Reinstalling the Host with openSUSE Tumbleweed
[role="procedure"]
____

. Reinstall the machine with openSUSE Tumbleweed (server profile recommended).
. Set the same hostname/FQDN and IP as before when possible.

____



=== Step 3: Re-register the Host with the Reactivation Key

.Procedure: Re-register the Host with the Reactivation Key
[role="procedure"]
____

. From the {productname} Web UI, obtain the system reactivation key for the existing proxy system record (Systems > Details > Reactivation).
. Bootstrap/re-register the Tumbleweed host using that reactivation key so it claims the existing system entry.

[NOTE]
====
Use your standard bootstrapping process for Tumbleweed hosts in your environment (for example, the bootstrap script or your configuration management), ensuring the reactivation key is applied.
====

____



=== Step 4: Install {productname} Proxy Tools and Podman

.Procedure: Install Proxy Tools and Podman
[role="procedure"]
____

. Add the Uyuni Master repository and install tools:

+

[source,shell]
----
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Master/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-x86_64-Media1 uyuni-server-master
zypper ref
zypper in mgrpxy mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion
----
. Ensure Podman is installed (required to run containers):

+

[source,shell]
----
zypper in podman
----

____



=== Step 5: Restore Configuration and Install the Proxy

.Procedure: Restore Configuration and Install the Proxy
[role="procedure"]
____

. Copy back the saved configuration directory to the new host:

+

[source,shell]
----
scp -r <USER>@<HOST>:/some/where/safe/uyuni /etc/
----
. If you saved Apache/Squid tuning files, place them at the expected default paths or note their locations for parameters in the next command:

+

[source,shell]
----
# Default paths expected by mgrpxy parameters (adjust/move your files accordingly)
# Apache tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf
# Squid tuning:  /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf
----
. Run the proxy installation with Podman. If you do not use tuning files, omit the corresponding parameters:

+

[source,shell]
----
# With tuning files
mgrpxy install podman \
	--tuning-httpd /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf \
	--tuning-squid /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf

# If you have no tuning files, remove the tuning parameters:
# mgrpxy install podman
----

[NOTE]
====
In an upcoming release, if tuning files are placed at the default paths noted above, the explicit parameters will not be required.
====

____


=== Step 6: Verify the Proxy

.Procedure: Verify the Proxy
[role="procedure"]
____

. Check containers are running:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl ps
# or
podman ps
----
. Confirm the proxy appears healthy in the {productname} Web UI and that clients using this proxy operate normally.

____

== Troubleshooting

* If Podman was missing, install it and rerun the [command]``mgrpxy install`` step.
* Verify the host’s time, hostname, and IP match expectations.
* If the host did not reattach to the existing system record, confirm you used the correct reactivation key and repeat the bootstrap.
