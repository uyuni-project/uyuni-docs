== Deployment Preparations


In this section, you will gain expertise in setting up and deploying a {productname} Server.
The process encompasses the installation of [command]``Podman``, [systemitem]``Uyuni container utilities``, deployment, and then initiating interaction with the container through [command]``mgrctl``.

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes you have already configured an {opensuse} {tumbleweed} host server, whether it is running on a physical machine or within a virtual environment.

https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/
====


== Container Host General Requirements

For general requirements, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:general-requirements.adoc[General requirements].

An {opensuse} {tumbleweed} server should be installed from installation media.

https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/

This procedure is described below.

[[installation-server-containers-requirements]]
== Container Host Requirements

For CPU, RAM, and storage requirements, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc[Hardware requirements].


[IMPORTANT]
====
To guarantee that clients can resolve the FQDN domain name, both the containerized server and the host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups.

== Installing Uyuni Tools For Use With Containers


.Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on {opensuse} {tumbleweed}
[role="procedure"]
____

. On your local host, open a terminal window and log in.
. Add the following repository to your {opensuse} {tumbleweed} server. You might need to use `sudo` for the following commands.

+

----
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-$(arch)-Media1/ uyuni-server-stable
----

+

. Refresh the repository list and import the key:

+

----
zypper ref
----

+

When prompted, trust and import the new repository GPG key.

+

. Install the container tools:

+

[source, shell]
----
zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion uyuni-storage-setup-server
----

____

For more information on the Uyuni Container Utilities, see link:https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Stable:ContainerUtils[Uyuni Container Utilities].


== Configure Custom Persistent Storage

This step is optional.
However, if custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the [command]``mgr-storage-server`` tool. 

* For more information, see [command]``mgr-storage-server --help``.
This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes.

Use the command in the following manner: 
----
mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>]
----

For example: 
----
mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1
----

[NOTE]
====
This command will create the persistent storage volumes at [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.

For more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[].
====


== Install and Enable Podman

Before deploying {productname}, you must install and enable [package]``podman``.

.Procedure: Installing and Enabling Podman
[role=procedure]
____

. Log in as root and install podman:
+
[source, shell]
----
zypper in podman
----

. Start and enable the Podman service:
+
[source, shell]
----
systemctl enable --now podman.service
----

== Deploying an Uyuni Container With Podman

=== [command]``mgradm`` Overview

{productname} is deployed as a container using the [command]``mgradm`` tool.
There are two methods of deploying a {productname} server as a container. 
In this section we will focus on basic container deployment.

For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/mgradm-yaml-custom-configuration.adoc[].

For additional information, you can explore further by running [command]``mgradm --help`` from the command line.

.Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman
. From the terminal run the following command as the sudo user or as root.
+
[source, shell]
----
sudo mgradm install podman
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step.

[source,shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing 
error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====

. Wait for deployment to complete.
. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.

//In this section you learned how to deploy an {productname} Server container.



=== Persistent Volumes

Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes.

[NOTE]
====
If you are just testing out {productname} you do not need to specify these volumes. 
[command]``mgradm`` will setup the correct volumes by default.

Specifying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments.
====

By default [command]``podman`` stores its volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``. 

You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``. 
This is especially important for the database and package mirrors. 

For a list of all persistent volumes in the container, see:

* xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[]
* xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-container-full-disk.adoc[]
