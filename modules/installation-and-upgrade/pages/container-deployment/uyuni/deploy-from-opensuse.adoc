= Deploying {productname} as a container


== Deployment preparations

In this section, you will gain expertise in setting up and deploying a {productname} Server.
The process encompasses the installation of [command]``Podman``, [systemitem]``Uyuni container utilities``, deployment, and then initiating interaction with the container through [command]``mgrctl``.

[NOTE]
====
This section assumes you have already configured an {opensuse} Leap {opensuse-version} server, whether it is running on a physical machine or within a virtual environment.
====



== Installing Podman on {opensuse} Leap {opensuse-version}


To install [command]``Podman`` on {opensuse} Leap {opensuse-version}, proceed with the following steps.

.Procedure: Installing Podman
. Open a terminal window.

. Update the package manager's repository information to ensure you have the latest package information:
+

[source,shell]
----
sudo zypper refresh
----

. Install [command]``Podman`` by running the following command:
+

[source,shell]
----
sudo zypper -y install podman
----
+

Zypper will download and install [command]``Podman`` along with its dependencies.

. When the installation is complete, verify that [command]``Podman`` is installed by running:
+

[source,shell]
----
podman --version
----
+

This command should display the installed version of [command]``Podman``.
You should now have [command]``Podman`` successfully installed on your openSUSE Leap 15.5 system, and you can start using it to manage containers on your system.

For more information, see https://podman.io/.



== Installing Uyuni tools for use with containers

=== {opensuse} {opensuse-version}

.Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on {opensuse} {opensuse-version}
. Add the following repository to your {opensuse} {opensuse-version} server and accept the key.
+

----
sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Master:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Leap_15.5/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master:ContainerUtils.repo
----

. Install tools:
+

[source, shell]
----
sudo zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion netavark
----

// === {opensuse} {tumbleweed}

// .Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on {opensuse} {tumbleweed}
// . Add the following repository to your {opensuse} {tumbleweed} server and accept the key.
// +

// ----
// sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Master:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Master:ContainerUtils.repo
// ----

// . Install tools:
// +

// [source, shell]
// ----
// sudo zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion netavark
// ----

== Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman



=== mgradm overview

{productname} is deployed as a container using the mgradm tool.
There are two approaches to deploying a {productname} server as a container. However, this section will focus on basic container deployment:

Basic deployment:: You can start basic container deployment by executing the [command]``mgradm`` command. This will guide you through entering basic server variables.



For additional information, you can explore further by running [command]``mgradm --help`` from the command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[command]``mgradm`` will prompt for basic variables if they are not provided using command line parameters or the [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` configuration file. 

For security, **using command line parameters to specify passwords should be avoided**: use a configuration file with proper permissions instead.
====


.Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman
. from the terminal run the following command a the sudo user.
+

[source, shell]
----
sudo mgradm install podman
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step.

[source, shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====

. Wait for deployment to complete.

. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN.

In this section you learned how to deploy an {productname} Server container.



=== Persistent volumes

Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes.

[NOTE]
====
If you are just testing out {productname} you do not need to specify these volumes. [command]``mgradm`` will setup the correct volumes by default.

Specifiying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments.
====

By default [command]``Podman`` stores its volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/``. 

You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk``. This is especially important for the database and package mirrors. 

For a list of all persistent volumes in the container see,  xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[Persistent container volumes]
