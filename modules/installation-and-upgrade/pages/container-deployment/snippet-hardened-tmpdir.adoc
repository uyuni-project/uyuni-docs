[NOTE]
====
{productname} server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the [path]``/tmp`` folder.
In such cases export the [literal]``TMPDIR`` environment variable to another existing path before running [command]``mgradm``.
For example:
----
export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp
