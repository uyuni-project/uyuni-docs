[NOTE]
====
{productname} server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the [path]``/tmp`` folder.
In such cases, as a workaround, export the [literal]``TMPDIR`` environment variable to another existing path before running [command]``mgradm``.
For example:

[source,shell]
----
export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp
----

In forthcoming maintenance updates, {productname} tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary.
