:description: To successfully run mgradm commands on hardened MLM servers, export the TMPDIR environment variable to a different directory.

[NOTE]
====
{productname} server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the [path]``/tmp`` folder.
In such cases, as a workaround, export the [literal]``TMPDIR`` environment variable to another existing path before running [command]``mgradm``.
For example:

[source,shell]
----
export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp
----

In {productname} updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary.
