= Required Network Ports

This section contains a comprehensive list of ports that are used for various communications within {productname}.

You will not need to open all of these ports.
Some ports only need to be opened if you are using the service that requires them.



== External Inbound Server Ports

External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Server to protect the server from unauthorized access.

Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the {productname} Server.

The client initiates the connection, and it stays open to receive commands from the Salt master.
| 4506        | TCP      | salt       | Required to accept communication requests from clients.
The client initiates the connection, and it stays open to report results back to the Salt master.

| 5557        | TCP      | Prometheus | Required for scraping Tomcat JMX metrics.

== External Outbound Server Ports

External outbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Server to restrict what the server can access.

Opening these ports allows network traffic from the {productname} Server to communicate with external services.

|===
| Port number | Protocol | Used By | Notes
| 80          | TCP | HTTP       | Required for {scc}.
Port 80 is not used to serve the {webui}.
| 443         | TCP | HTTPS      | Required for {scc}.
| 25151       | TCP | Cobbler    |
|===



== Internal Server Ports

Internal port are used internally by the {productname} Server.
Internal ports are only accessible from [literal]``localhost``.

In most cases, you will not need to adjust these ports.

|===
| Port number | Notes
| 2828        | Satellite-search API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.
| 2829        | Taskomatic API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat.
| 8005        | Tomcat shutdown port.
| 8009        | Tomcat to Apache HTTPD (AJP).
| 8080        | Tomcat to Apache HTTPD (HTTP).
| 9080        | Salt-API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.
| 32000       | Port for a TCP connection to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that runs Taskomatic and satellite-search.
|===


Port 32768 and higher are used as ephemeral ports.
These are most often used to receive TCP connections.
When a TCP connection request is received, the sender will choose one of these ephemeral port numbers to match the destination port.

You can use this command to find out which ports are ephemeral ports:

----
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
----



== External Inbound Proxy Ports

External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Proxy to protect the proxy from unauthorized access.

Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the {productname} proxy.

|===
| Port number | Protocol | Used By | Notes
| 22          |          |         | Required for ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel contact methods.
Clients connected to the proxy initiate check in on the server and hop through to clients.
| 67          | TCP/UDP  | DHCP    | Required only if clients are requesting IP addresses from the server.
| 69          | TCP/UDP  | TFTP    | Required if the server is used as a PXE server for automated client installation.
| 443         | TCP      | HTTPS   | {webui}, client, and server and proxy (``tftpsync``) requests.
| 4505        | TCP      | salt    | Required to accept communication requests from clients.
The client initiates the connection, and it stays open to receive commands from the Salt master.
| 4506        | TCP      | salt    | Required to accept communication requests from clients.
The client initiates the connection, and it stays open to report results back to the Salt master.

== External Outbound Proxy Ports

External outbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Proxy to restrict what the proxy can access.

Opening these ports allows network traffic from the {productname} Proxy to communicate with external services.

| Port number | Protocol | Used By | Notes
| 80          |          |         | Used to reach the server.
| 443         | TCP      | HTTPS   | Required for {scc}.
|===



== External Client Ports

External client ports must be opened to configure a firewall between the {productname} Server and its clients.

In most cases, you will not need to adjust these ports.

| Port number | Direction | Protocol | Notes
| 22          | Inbound   | SSH      | Required for ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel contact methods.
| 80          | Outbound  |          | Used to reach the server or proxy.
| 9090        | Outbound  | TCP      | Required for Prometheus user interface.
| 9093        | Outbound  | TCP      | Required for Prometheus alert manager.

| 9187        | Outbound  | TCP      | Required for Prometheus PostgreSQL.

== Required URLs

There are some URLs that {productname} must be able to access to register clients and perform updates.
In most cases, allowing access to these URLs is sufficient:

* scc.suse.com
* updates.suse.com

If you are using non-{suse} clients you might also need to allow access to other servers that provide specific packages for those operating systems.
For example, if you have {ubuntu} clients, you will need to be able to access the {ubuntu} server.

For more information about troubleshooting firewall access for non-{suse} clients, see xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-firewalls.adoc[].
