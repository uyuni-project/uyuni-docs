Public clouds provide {productname} under a Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) model.
That means that they pre-install {productname}, so you do not need to perform any installation steps.

However, you will need to perform some additional setup steps before you can use {productname}.
For public cloud setup instructions, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:pubcloud-setup.adoc[].
