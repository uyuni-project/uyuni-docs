= Upgrade Intro 

**Updated:** {docdate}

{productname} has three main components, all of which need regular updates.
This guide covers updating the {productname} Server, Proxy, and clients, as well as some underlying components, such as the database.

It is possible to automate some of the upgrades, but others need to be performed manually.

[NOTE]
====
This guide is not intended to be read cover to cover.
Instead, navigate to the component you want to upgrade, then identify the versions you are upgrading from and to.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
{productname} uses an [literal]``X.Y.Z`` versioning schema.
To determine which upgrade procedure you need, look at which part of the version number is changing.

Major Version Upgrade (X Upgrade)::
Upgrading to the next major version.
For example, upgrading from 3.2 to 4.1.
This type of upgrade does not apply to 4.2.

Minor Version Upgrade (Y Upgrade)::
Upgrading to the next minor version.
This is often referred to as a product migration, service pack migration, or SP migration.
For example, upgrading from 4.1 to 4.2.

Patch Level Upgrade (Z Upgrade)::
Upgrading within the same minor version.
This is often referred to as a maintenance update.
For example, upgrading from 4.1.2 to 4.1.8 or from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1.

If you are upgrading the {productname} Server, see xref:upgrade:server-intro.adoc[].
