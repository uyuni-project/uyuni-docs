= Upgrade introduction

**Updated:** {docdate}

{productname} has three main components, all of which need regular updates.
This guide covers updating the {productname} Server, Proxy, and clients, as well as some underlying components, such as the database.

It is possible to automate some of the upgrades, but others need to be performed manually.

[NOTE]
====
This guide is not intended to be read cover to cover.
Instead, navigate to the component you want to upgrade, then identify the versions you are upgrading from and to.
====

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
{productname} uses an [literal]``X.Y.Z`` versioning schema.
To determine which upgrade procedure you need, look at which part of the version number is changing.

[NOTE]
====
The version number below are just examples.
Do not understand them as most recent available options.
{suse} uses these numbers for illustrative purposes only!
====

Major Version Upgrade (X Upgrade)::
Upgrading to the next major version.
Such a major upgrade usually is an upgrade from X.Y to X+1.0 or to X+1.1, where Y is the latest minor version of the X series.
For example:

* From version 3.2 to 4.0 or to 4.1 (upgrading directly from 3.2 to 4.2 or later is not supported).

Minor Version Upgrade (Y Upgrade)::
Upgrading to the next minor version.
This is often referred to as a product migration, service pack migration, or SP migration.
Such a minor upgrade is an upgrade from X.Y to X.Y+1.
For example:

* From 4.2 to 4.3.

If you take a closer look, you always upgrade from and to the latest patch level of the minor version.
For example, from 4.2.12 to 4.3.8.

Patch Level Upgrade (Z Upgrade)::
Upgrading within the same minor version.
This is often referred to as a maintenance update or MU.
For example, upgrading from 4.3.7 to 4.3.8.
