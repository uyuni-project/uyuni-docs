== Upgrade the Proxy

To update a proxy you first stop the proxy service, then update the software and finally restart the proxy service.



.Procedure: Updating the {productname} Proxy
. On the {productname} Proxy, stop the proxy service:
+
----
spacewalk-proxy stop
----
. In the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Proxy] and click the name of the proxy.
. Select all the packages to be updated on the proxy, and then apply the selection.
. On the {productname} Proxy, start the proxy service:

If you need to update many proxies, you can create an action chain of this command sequence on the {productname} Server.
You can use the action chain to perform updates on multiple proxies at the same time.
