= {postgresql} Requirements

{postgresql} is the only supported database.
Using a remote {postgresql} database or remote file systems (such as NFS) with the {postgresql} database is not supported.
In other words, {postgresql} should be on the fastest available storage for {productname}.

**Additional background information:**

Because of potential performance issues, running a {postgresql} database remotely from {productname} is discouraged in general.
While it does work and is stable in many cases, there is always a risk of data loss if something goes wrong.
