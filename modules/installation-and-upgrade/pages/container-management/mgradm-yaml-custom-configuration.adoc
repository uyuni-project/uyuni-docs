= Custom YAML Configuration and Deployment with [command]``mgradm``

You have the option to create a custom [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` file, which the [command]``mgradm`` tool can utilize during deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[command]``mgradm`` will prompt for basic variables if they are not provided using command line parameters or the [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` configuration file.

For security, **using command line parameters to specify passwords should be avoided**: use a configuration file with proper permissions instead.
