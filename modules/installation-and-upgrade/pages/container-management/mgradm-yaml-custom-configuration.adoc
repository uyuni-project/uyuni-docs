= Custom YAML configuration and deployment with mgradm

You have the option to create a custom [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` file, which the [command]``mgradm`` tool can utilize during deployment. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
[command]``mgradm`` will prompt for basic variables if they are not provided using command line parameters or the [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` configuration file. 

For security, **using command line parameters to specify passwords should be avoided**: use a configuration file with proper permissions instead.

.Procedure: Deploying the {productname} container with Podman using a custom configuration file
. Prepare a configuration file named [filename]``mgradm.yaml`` similar to the following example:
+

[source, yaml]
....
# Database password. Randomly generated by default
db:
  password: MySuperSecretDBPass

# Password for the CA certificate
ssl:
  password: MySuperSecretSSLPassword

# Your SUSE Customer Center credentials
scc: 
  user: ccUsername
  password: ccPassword

# Organization name
organization: YourOrganization

# Email address sending the notifications
emailFrom: notifications@example.com

# Administrators account details
admin:
  password: MySuperSecretAdminPass
  login: LoginName
  firstName: Admin
  lastName: Admin
  email: email@example.com
....

. From the terminal, run the following command as the root user.
  Entering your server's FQDN is optional.
+

[source, shell]
----
mgradm -c mgradm.yaml install podman <FQDN>
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed on the terminal if you miss this step.

[source, shell]
----
