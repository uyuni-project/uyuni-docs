= Update Containers

Before running the upgrade command, it is recommended to upgrade the [literal]``mgrpxy`` tool first.

.Procedure
. One can do so by running the following command:
+
----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied, [literal]``reboot``.

. The {productname} {productnumber} Proxy containers running on [literal]``podman`` can be updated using the following command:
+

----
mgrpxy upgrade podman
----
+
. Or, those running on a Kubernetes cluster can update using:
+
----
mgrpxy upgrade kubernetes
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify the tag parameter when upgrading to specific version, it will default to upgrading to the most recent version.
To upgrade to a specific version, provide the tag parameter with the desired image tag.

[IMPORTANT]
====

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
While there is an option to upgrade a specific container using its specific tag, this feature is intended for applying PTFs only.
endif::[]

We highly recommend using the same tag for all proxy containers to ensure consistency under normal circumstances.
====

For air-gapped installations, first upgrade the container RPM packages, then run the [command]``mgrpxy upgrade podman`` command.
