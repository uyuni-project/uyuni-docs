[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify the tag parameter when upgrading to specific version, it will default to upgrading to the most recent version.
To upgrade to a specific version, provide the tag parameter with the desired image tag.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
While there is an option to upgrade a specific container using its specific tag, this feature is intended for applying PTFs only.
We highly recommend using the same tag for all proxy containers to ensure consistency under normal circumstances.
====

For air-gapped installations, first upgrade the container RPM packages, then run the [command]``mgrpxy upgrade podman`` command.
