= {productname} Proxy Upgrade
:revdate: 2025-05-05
:page-revdate: {revdate}

Before running the upgrade command, it is required to update the host operating system.
Updating the host operating system will also result in the update of the {productname} tooling such as the [literal]``mgrpxy`` tool.

.Procedure: Upgrading Proxy

. Refresh software repositories with [command]``zypper``:

+

[source,shell]
----
zypper ref
----

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]

. Depending on the host operating system, proceed with these steps:

+

For a transactional system such as {sl-micro}: ::

+

--

. Apply available updates with [command]``transactional-update``:

+

[source,shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied, [literal]``reboot``.

--

+

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

. Apply available updates with [command]``transactional-update``:

+

[source,shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied, [literal]``reboot``.

endif::[]


ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]

For {sles}: ::

+

--

Update installed software with [command]``zypper``:

[source,shell]
----
zypper up
----

--

endif::[]

+

. The {productname} Proxy containers running on [literal]``podman`` can be updated using the following command:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrpxy upgrade podman
----

+

Or, those running on a Kubernetes cluster can update using:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrpxy upgrade kubernetes
----

[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify the tag parameter when upgrading to specific version, it will default to upgrading to the most recent version.
To upgrade to a specific version, provide the tag parameter with the desired image tag.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]

While there is an option to upgrade a specific container using its specific tag, this feature is intended for applying PTFs only.
endif::[]

We highly recommend using the same tag for all proxy containers to ensure consistency under normal circumstances.
====

For air-gapped installations, first upgrade the container RPM packages, then run the [command]``mgrpxy upgrade podman`` command.
