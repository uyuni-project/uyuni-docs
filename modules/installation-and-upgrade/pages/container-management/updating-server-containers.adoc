= Update Containers

Before running the upgrade command, it is recommended to upgrade the [literal]``mgradm`` tool first.

. One can do so by running the following command:
+
----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied, [literal]``reboot``.

. The {productname} {productnumber} Server container can be updated using the following command:
+

----
mgradm upgrade podman
----

This command will bring the status of the container up-to-date and restart the server.

.Upgrading to specific version
