= {productname} Server Upgrade
:revdate: 2025-07-29
:page-revdate: {revdate}

Before running the upgrade command, it is required to update the host operating system.
Updating the host operating system will also result in the update of the {productname} tooling such as the [literal]``mgradm`` tool.

.Procedure: Upgrading Server

. Refresh software repositories with [command]``zypper``:

+

[source,shell]
----
zypper ref
----

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]

. Depending on the host operating system, proceed with these steps:

+

For a transactional system such as {sl-micro}: ::

+

--

. Apply available updates with [command]``transactional-update``:

+

[source,shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied, [literal]``reboot``.

--

+

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

. Apply available updates with [command]``transactional-update``:

+

[source,shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. If updates were applied, [literal]``reboot``.

endif::[]

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]

For {sles}: ::

+

--

Update installed software with [command]``zypper``:

[source,shell]
----
zypper up
----

--

endif::[]

+

. The {productname} Server container can be updated using the following command:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgradm upgrade podman
----

+

This command will bring the status of the container up-to-date and restart the server.


.Upgrading with third-party SSL certificate
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using third-party certificates, the database container needs to have an SSL certificate with the following Subject Alternate Names (SANs):

* [literal]``db``
* [literal]``reportdb``
* the externally facing fully qualified domain name

The same certificate can be used for both the main container and the database one, but it needs to have those SANs too.

In order to pass the new certificates to the upgrade command, use the [command]``--ssl-db-ca-root``, [command]``--ssl-db-cert`` and [command]``--ssl-db-key`` parameters.
====

.Upgrading to specific version
[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify the tag parameter, it will default to upgrading to the most recent version.
To upgrade to a specific version, provide the tag parameter with the desired image tag.
====

For more information on the upgrade command and its parameters, use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
mgradm upgrade podman -h
----


For air-gapped installations, first upgrade the container RPM packages, then run the [literal]``mgradm`` command.
