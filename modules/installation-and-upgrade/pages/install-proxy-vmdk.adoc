== {productname} Virtual Machine Creation - VMware

This sections describes VMware configurations, focusing on the creation of an extra virtual disk essential for the {productname} storage partition within VMware environments.

.Procedure: Creating the VMware Virtual Machine

. Download {productname} Server [filename]``.vmdk`` file.
  Then transfer a copy to your VMware storage.

. Make a copy of uploaded [filename]``.vmdk`` file using VMware web interface.
  This will convert provided [filename]``.vmdk`` file to the format suitable for vSphere hypervisor.
  Use this new copy as a base image for the virtual machine.

. Create and name a new virtual machine based on the Guest OS Family [systemitem]``Linux`` and Guest OS Version {sle} 15 (64-bit).

. Add an additional [systemitem]``Hard Disk 2`` of 500 GB (or more).

. Configure RAM and number of CPUs (at least 8 GB RAM and 2 CPUs).

. Set the network adapter as required.

. Power on the VM.

. At the JeOS Firstboot screen select start to continue and check the following configuration dialogs (keyboard layout, license agreement, time zone, password for root).


. When installation completes log in as root.

. For registering {productname} Proxy with SCC, preparing  {productname} Proxy storage, and further steps, proceed with xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-proxy-vm.adoc#minimal.susemgrproxy.prep[].
