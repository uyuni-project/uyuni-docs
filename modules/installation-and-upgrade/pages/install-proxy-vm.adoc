= Install {productname} Proxy in a Virtual Machine Environment Using {productname} Proxy VM Image



== Virtual Machine Manager Settings

This chapter provides the required Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) settings for {productname} Proxy.
KVM combined with Virtual Machine Manager (_virt-manager_) will be used as a sandbox for this installation.



You will find the VM images for {productname} {productnumber} Proxy in various formats.
It includes {sles} {sles-version} {sp-base} as the underlying operating system and the {productname} Proxy software current at the time of build.
Download the appropriate {productname} Proxy image for your environment from https://download.suse.com/.

[NOTE]
====
This table specifies the minimum requirements.
These are suitable for a quick test installation, such as a server with one client.
If you want to use a production environment, review the requirements listed in xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

[[proxyvm.kvm.install]]
== Install {productname} Proxy Virtual Machine


Create virtual machine with additional virtual disks required for the {productname} Proxy storage partitions.

// FIXME: add details on networking (bridge).

.Procedure: Creating the VM and Additional Partitions with [command]``virt-manager``
. In [command]``virt-manager``, open menu:File[New Virtual Machine].
. In the [guimenu]``Create a new virtual machine`` dialog, select [guimenu]``Import existing disk image`` and confirm with btn:[Forward].
. Enter the filename of the downloaded {productname} Proxy KVM image and set [literal]``SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4`` as the operating system.
  Confirm with btn:[Forward].
. Configure RAM and number of CPUs (at least 8 GB RAM and 2 CPUs).
  Confirm with btn:[Forward].
. Set the name of your VM and select the [guimenu]``Customize configuration before install`` check box.
. With the [guimenu]``Network selection`` drop-down menu select the configured bridge device.
. Confirm with btn:[Finish].
. In the overview dashboard, at the bottom of the left navigation bar, click btn:[Add Hardware] to create additional virtual disks.
  These disks will be partitioned and mounted later.

[NOTE]
====
Storage size values are the absolute minimum—only suitable for a small test or demo installation.
Also consider to create a separate partition for [path]``/srv/tftpboot/`` where images on Retail Branchservers are stored.

. Above the left navigation bar, click btn:[Begin Installation] to boot the new VM from the {productname} Proxy image.
  Wait until the [guimenu]``JeOS Firstboot`` start option is presented.



== Run JeOS Firstboot Setup

. Confirm to start the [guimenu]``JeOS Firstboot`` setup.
. Select system locale such as [literal]``en_US``.
. Select keyboard layout such as [literal]``us``.
. Check end user license agreement.
. Select time zone such as [literal]``UTC``.
. Enter and confirm root password.
  Keep note of the root password.
. Wait until the login prompt is presented.

== Preparing virtual machine for {productname} Proxy

Before starting, obtain a registration code for this image from SUSE Customer Center - https://scc.suse.com.


[[proc.minimal.susemgrproxy.prep]]
.Procedure: Preparing for {productname} Proxy run

. Log in as `root`.

. Register {productname} Proxy with SCC:
+

----
SUSEConnect -e <EMAIL_ADDRESS> -r <SUSE_MANAGER_PROXY_CODE>
----

. Prepare {productname} Proxy storage:
  [command]``suma-storage`` command automatically prepares and configures previously created external storage for use with the proxy.
  In the following command, the first parameter is the device for {productname} Proxy Squid cache that [command]``suma-storage`` can handle:
+

----
suma-storage /dev/vdb
----
+
// FIXME info about network configuration and applying update in readme

. The virtual machine is now ready for {productname} Proxy to be set up.


Continue with registering the installed {productname} Proxy as a client: xref:installation-and-upgrade:proxy-registration.adoc[].
