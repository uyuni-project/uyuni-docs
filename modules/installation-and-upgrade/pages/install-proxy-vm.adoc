= Install {productname} Proxy in a Virtual Machine Environment Using {productname} Proxy VM Image



== Virtual Machine Manager Settings

This chapter provides the required Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) settings for {productname} Proxy.
KVM combined with Virtual Machine Manager (_virt-manager_) will be used as a sandbox for this installation.



You will find the VM images for {productname} {productnumber} Proxy in various formats.
It includes {sles} {sles-version} {sp-base} as the underlying operating system and the {productname} Proxy software current at the time of build.
Download the appropriate {productname} Proxy image for your environment from https://download.suse.com/.

[NOTE]
====
This table specifies the minimum requirements.
These are suitable for a quick test installation, such as a server with one client.
If you want to use a production environment, review the requirements listed in xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

[[proxyvm.kvm.install]]
== Install {productname} Proxy Virtual Machine


Create virtual machine with three additional virtual disks required for the {productname} Proxy storage partitions.

// FIXME: add details on networking (bridge).

.Procedure: Creating the VM and Additional Partitions with KVM
. Create a new virtual machine using the downloaded {productname} Proxy KVM image and select [guimenu]``Import existing disk image``.
. Set [literal]``SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4`` as the installed operating system.
. Configure RAM and number of CPUs (at least 8 GB RAM and 2 CPUs).
. Configure networking (bridge).
. Name your KVM machine and select the [guimenu]``Customize configuration before install`` check box.
. Click btn:[Add Hardware] to create additional virtual disks.
  These disks will be partitioned and mounted later.
+

[NOTE]
====
Storage size values are the absolute minimum—only suitable for a small test or demo installation.
Also consider to create a separate partition for [path]``/srv/tftpboot/`` where images on Retail Branchservers are stored.

| VirtIO Disk 3        | tftpboot   | 100{nbsp}GB
|===


. Click btn:[Begin Installation] to boot the new VM from the {productname} Proxy image.
  Wait until the login prompt is presented.


== Run JeOS Firstboot Setup

. Confirm to start the setup.
. Select system locale such as [literal]``en_US``.
. Select keyboard layout such as [literal]``us``.
. Check end user license agreement.
. Select time zone such as [literal]``UTC``.
. Enter and confirm root password.
  Keep note of the root password.

== Preparing virtual machine for {productname} Proxy

Before starting, obtain a registration code for this image from SUSE Customer Center - https://scc.suse.com.


[[proc.minimal.susemgrproxy.prep]]
.Procedure: Preparing for {productname} Proxy run

. Log in as `root`.

. Register {productname} Proxy with SCC:
+

----
SUSEConnect -e <EMAIL_ADDRESS> -r <SUSE_MANAGER_PROXY_CODE>
----
+

// FIXME (just taken over from server image installation

. Prepare {productname} Proxy storage:
  [path]``suma-storage`` command automatically prepares and configures previously created external storage for use with the proxy.
  In the following command the first parameter is the device for {productname} Proxy Squid cache, the second parameter is the device for Retail images.
+

----
suma-storage /dev/vdb /dev/vdc
----
+
// FIXME info about network configuration and applying update in readme

. The virtual machine is now ready for {productname} Proxy to be set up.


Continue with registering the installed {productname} Proxy as a client: xref:installation-and-upgrade:proxy-registration.adoc[].
