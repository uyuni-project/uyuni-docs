= Proxy Registration

Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script.

This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy as the {productname} client, using an activation key.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the {productname} Proxy channel.

.Procedure: Registering the Proxy

. On the {productname} Server, create openSUSE Leap and the {productname} Proxy channels with the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` command.
    [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is part of the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package:

// Atfer a successful sync run, bootstrap repos are now created automatically.
// Since 2020.07 or earlier
. Create the openSUSE Leap Uyuni Client Tools Repository for bootstrapping.
For more information about bootstrapping, see xref:client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc[].
////
. Create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the other channels as child channels.
    For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy.
    Add the GPG key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter.

// Traditional clients are not supported
. Bootstrap the client using the script.
    For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
. Navigate to menu:Salt[Keys] and accept the key.
