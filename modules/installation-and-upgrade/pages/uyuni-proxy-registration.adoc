[[proxy-register]]
= {productname} Proxy Registration

Proxy systems are registered as {salt} clients using bootstrap script or {webui}.

This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy as the {productname} client, using an activation key.

[[proxy-register-procedure]]
.Procedure: Registering the Proxy
. On the {productname} Server, create openSUSE Leap and the {productname} Proxy channels with the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` command.
    [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is part of the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package:

opensuse_leap15_4 \
opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss \

Instead of [systemitem]``uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154`` you can also try [systemitem]``uyuni-proxy-devel-leap`` which is the current development version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the {opensuse} Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the {productname} Proxy channel.
====

. Create an activation key with {opensuse} Leap as a base channel and the other channels as child channels. 
  OM REMOVE: For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].

. Create a bootstrap script for the proxy, and adjust it.
    Add the GPG key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter.
//    For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuseleap.adoc[].
//    For more information about bootstrap scripts, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

. Bootstrap the client using the script.
    OM REMOVE: For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

. Navigate to menu:Salt[Keys] and accept the key.
  When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in menu:Systems[Overview] in the [guimenu]``Recently Registered Systems`` section.

. Alternatively, in the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:System[Bootstrapping].

. Navigate to menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels], and check that the proxy channel is selected.

For setting up a registered {productname} Proxy, see xref:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc[].
