= Server - Minor Version Upgrade (Y Upgrade)

You can upgrade {productname} to the next minor version using either the {yast} online migration tool or the Zypper command line tool.
This is often referred to as a product migration, service pack migration, or SP migration.
This procedure does not replace the server with an updated copy.
It is an in-place upgrade.

Examples:
* [literal]``4.2.x`` → [literal]``4.3.0`` or [literal]``4.1.x`` → [literal]``4.3.0`

The upgrade from version 4.1 to 4.3 will also upgrade the base OS from SLES 15 SP2 to SLES 15 SP5​, and the PostgreSQL database from version{nbsp}12 to 14 with an additional step.
For more information about the database upgrade, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:db-migration-xy.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrades should be run from a text console, rather than a graphical interface like GNOME.
If you are logged into a GNOME session running on the machine you are going to migrate, you will need to switch to a text console.
This does not apply if you are logged in from a remote machine (unless you are running a VNC session with GNOME).
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before the upgrade, ensure that storage requirements are met.
For more information, see xref:hardware-requirements.adoc[].
The migration procedure can fill the root partition if there is not enough space available due to the service pack migration and the download of new software packages.
It is the same for the [path]``/var/lib/pgsql`` when upgrading PostgreSQL.
It takes a copy of the old database, thus be sure to have at least enough space available to cope with a copy of the database.

== Preparing Upgrade to 4.3

Before you start the upgrade process you must deactive the Python 2 module ([package]``sle-module-python2``) on the old 4.1.x or 4.2.x {productname} Server.
In case of 4.1.x, on the command line, as root, run:

----
SUSEConnect -d -p sle-module-python2/15.2/x86_64
----

In case of 4.2.x, on the command line, as root, run:

----
SUSEConnect -d -p sle-module-python2/15.3/x86_64
----

This deactivation step is necessary because the Python 2 module is no longer available on the new {productname} 4.3.
On {productname} Server 4.3, the Python 3 module ([package]``sle-module-python3``) will get installed.

For more information, see the {productname} 4.3 release notes.
