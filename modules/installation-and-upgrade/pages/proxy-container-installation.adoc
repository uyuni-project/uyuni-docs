[[installation-proxy-containers-services]]
== Install Container Services on the host system

[NOTE]
====
Container host used as a base for {productname} Proxy containers needs to be first registered as a Salt client to the {productname} Server.

For more information about registering Salt client to the {productname} Server, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
[literal]``Containers Module`` is required to be available for container host.
====

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

First step is to install container control files provided by package [literal]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-services``.


[[proc-installation-proxy-containers-services]]
.Procedure: Installation Of Container Services For {productname} Proxy

. Assign [literal]``Containers Module`` software channel to the container host in the {productname}.
+
For more information about assigning software channels to the system, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].

. Log in as `root` on the container host.

. Manually install {productname} Proxy service package:
+

[[installation-proxy-containers-customize-config]]
== Customize {productname} Proxy configuration

{productname} Proxy containers require some volumes to be mounted for long term storage.
Paths on container host for those volumes are by default:

- [path]``/var/lib/uyuni/proxy-squid-cache``
- [path]``/var/lib/uyuni/proxy-rhn-cache``
- [path]``/var/lib/uyuni/proxy-tftpboot``

To modify location of those paths, edit [path]``/etc/sysconfig/uyuni-proxy-systemd-services.config``.

In this file it is possible to add custom arguments passed to podman container pod:

- [literal]``EXTRA_POD_ARGS=''``

In this file it is possible to modify path where proxy configuration is expected, however modifying it is strongly discouraged:

- [literal]`CONFIG_DIR`=[path]`/etc/uyuni/proxy`


[[installation-proxy-containers-firewall-rules]]
== Allow network access for provided services on container host firewall

{productname} Proxy containers work as so called node-port service. This means proxy container pod shares container host network TCP and UDP port space. For this reason container host firewall must be configured to accept incoming traffic on ports used by {productname} Proxy containers. Those ports are:

- 69/UDP - TFTP
- 80/TCP - HTTP
- 443/TCP - HTTPS
- 4505/TCP - Salt
- 4506/TCP - Salt
- 8022/TCP - SSH

Continue with setting up the installed {productname} Proxy as a containers at xref:proxy-container-setup.adoc[].
