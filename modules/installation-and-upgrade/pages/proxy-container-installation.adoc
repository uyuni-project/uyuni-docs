.Proxy Container Host Hardware Requirements
|===

| Hardware
| Details
| Recommendation

| CPU
|
| Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores

| RAM
| Test Server
| Minimum 2{nbsp}GB

|
| Production Server
| Minimum 8{nbsp}GB

| Disk Space
|
| Minimum 100{nbsp}GB

|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
The container proxy must have a unique Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
This should not be the same as the FQDN of the container host.
To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both container proxy and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server.
You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured.

[[installation-proxy-containers-services]]
== Install Container Services on the host system

[NOTE]
====
Container host used as a base for {productname} Proxy containers needs to be first registered as a Salt client to the {productname} Server.

For more information about registering Salt client to the {productname} Server, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
[literal]``Containers Module`` is required to be available for container host.
====

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

First step is to install container control files provided by package [literal]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-services``.


[[proc-installation-proxy-containers-services]]
.Procedure: Installation Of Container Services For {productname} Proxy

. Assign [literal]``Containers Module`` software channel to the container host in the {productname}.
+
For more information about assigning software channels to the system, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].

. Log in as `root` on the container host.

. Manually install {productname} Proxy service package:
+

zypper install uyuni-proxy-systemd-services

[[installation-proxy-containers-customize-config]]
== Customize {productname} Proxy configuration

{productname} Proxy containers require some volumes to be mounted for long term storage.
Those volumes are automatically created by podman and can be listed using the [literal]``podman volume ls`` command.
By default, [literal]``podman`` stores the files of the volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.
The needed volume are named:

- [path]``uyuni-proxy-squid-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-tftpboot``

To override the default volume settings, create the volumes prior to the first start of the pod using the [literal]``podman volume create`` command.

In the [path]``/etc/sysconfig/uyuni-proxy-systemd-services.config`` file it is possible to add custom arguments passed to podman container pod:

- [literal]``EXTRA_POD_ARGS=''``

In this file it is possible to modify the tag to use for the container images:

- [literal]``TAG``=[path]``latest``


[[installation-proxy-containers-firewall-rules]]
== Allow network access for provided services on container host firewall

{productname} Proxy containers work as so called node-port service. This means proxy container pod shares container host network TCP and UDP port space. For this reason container host firewall must be configured to accept incoming traffic on ports used by {productname} Proxy containers. Those ports are:

- 69/UDP - TFTP
- 80/TCP - HTTP
- 443/TCP - HTTPS
- 4505/TCP - Salt
- 4506/TCP - Salt
- 8022/TCP - SSH

Continue with setting up the installed {productname} Proxy as a containers at xref:proxy-container-setup.adoc[].
