= Install Containerized {productname} Proxy


== Introduction

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
Only {opensuse} Leap 15.3 and newer are supported to be used as container host for {productname} Proxy containers.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

{productname} Proxy containers are supported only on {sles} 15 SP3 and newer versions.
endif::[]

To be used as a base for {productname} Proxy, container first needs to be registered as a {salt} client to the {productname} Server.
[literal]``Containers Module`` is also required to be available for the container host.

Connecting the container host as a traditional client will not work because required packages are not available.

For more information about registering {salt} client to the {productname} Server, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].


[[installation-proxy-containers-requirements]]
== Container Host Requirements

To ensure that the domain name of the {productname} Server can be resolved by the clients:

* Both container proxy and client machines must be connected to a DNS server
* Reverse lookup must work

[[installation-proxy-containers-services]]
== Install Container Services on the Host System

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

The first step is to install container control files provided by package [literal]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-services``.


[[proc-installation-proxy-containers-services]]
.Procedure: Installation of Container Services for {productname} Proxy

. Assign [literal]``Containers Module`` software channel to the container host in the {productname}.
For more information about assigning software channels to the system, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].

. Log in as `root` on the container host.

. Manually install {productname} Proxy service package:
+
----
zypper install uyuni-proxy-systemd-services
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Package [literal]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-service`` comes from the following channels:

* SLE-Manager-Tools_15
* SLE-Manager-Tools-For-Micro_5 in the case of {sle-micro}
====



[[installation-proxy-containers-customize-config]]
== Customize {productname} Proxy Configuration

{productname} Proxy containers require some volumes to be mounted for long term storage.
Those volumes are automatically created by [literal]``podman`` and can be listed using the [command]``podman volume ls`` command.
By default, [literal]``podman`` stores the files of the volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.
The volumes are named:

- [path]``uyuni-proxy-squid-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-tftpboot``

To override default volume settings, create the volumes prior to the first start of the pod using the  [command]``podman volume create`` command.

It is possible to add custom arguments passed to podman container pod to [path]``/etc/sysconfig/uyuni-proxy-systemd-services.config``:

----
EXTRA_POD_ARGS=''
----

In this file it is possible to modify tag to use for container images:

----
TAG=latest
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the [path]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-services.config`` file and especially the [literal]``TAG`` setting is dangerous and can cause a non-functional system.
====



=== Using a Custom Container Image for a Service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service.
The [literal]``uyuni-proxy`` CLI bundled with the package, runs [command]``update image`` with the following parameters:

- [literal]``-s`` for the service name
- [literal]``-t`` for the version tag
- [literal]``-r`` for the registry path

For example, use it like this:

----
uyuni-proxy update image -s httpd -t 0.1.0 -r registry.opensuse.org/uyuni
----

It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni`` is the registry and [literal]``0.1.0`` is the version tag, before restarting it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the proxy reset command, specifying the service with the [literal]``-s`` parameter:

----
uyuni-proxy reset -s httpd
----

This command first resets the configuration of the [literal]``httpd`` service to the global defaults and then reloads it.

For more information, see [command]``uyuni-proxy --help``.



[[installation-proxy-containers-firewall-rules]]
== Allow Network Access for Provided Services on Container Host Firewall

{productname} Proxy containers work as so called node-port service.
This means proxy container pod shares container host network TCP and UDP port space.
For this reason container host firewall must be configured to accept incoming traffic on ports used by {productname} Proxy containers.
Those ports are:

- 69/UDP - TFTP
- 80/TCP - HTTP
- 443/TCP - HTTPS
- 4505/TCP - Salt
- 4506/TCP - Salt
- 8022/TCP - SSH
