= Install Containerized {productname} Proxy

[NOTE]
====
ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
Only {opensuse} Leap 15.3 and newer are supported to be used as container host for {productname} Proxy containers.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
Only {sles} 15 SP3 and newer are supported to be used as container host for {productname} Proxy containers.
endif::[]
====

The container host must be connected to the manager as a Salt client.
Connecting the container host as a traditional client will not work because required packages will not be available.

Reverse lookups must work correctly.

[[installation-proxy-containers-services]]
== Install Container Services on the host system

[NOTE]
====
Container host to be used as a base for {productname} Proxy containers needs to be first registered as a Salt client to the {productname} Server.

For more information about registering Salt client to the {productname} Server, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
[literal]``Containers Module`` is required to be available for container host.
====

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

First step is to install container control files provided by package [literal]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-services``.


[[proc-installation-proxy-containers-services]]
.Procedure: Installation of Container Services for {productname} Proxy

. Assign [literal]``Containers Module`` software channel to the container host in the {productname}.
For more information about assigning software channels to the system, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].

. Log in as `root` on the container host.

. Manually install {productname} Proxy service package:
+

----
zypper install uyuni-proxy-systemd-services
----



[[installation-proxy-containers-customize-config]]
== Customize {productname} Proxy configuration

{productname} Proxy containers require some volumes to be mounted for long term storage.
Those volumes are automatically created by [literal]``podman`` and can be listed using the [command]``podman volume ls`` command.
By default, [literal]``podman`` stores the files of the volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.
The volumes are named:

- [path]``uyuni-proxy-squid-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-tftpboot``

To override the default volume settings, create the volumes prior to the first start of the pod using the [literal]``podman volume create`` command.

It is possible to add custom arguments passed to podman container pod to [path]``/etc/sysconfig/uyuni-proxy-systemd-services.config``:

----
EXTRA_POD_ARGS=''
----

In this file it is possible to modify tag to use for container images:

----
TAG=latest
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the [path]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-services.config`` file and especially the [literal]``TAG`` setting is dangerous and can cause a non-functional system.
====



=== Using a custom container image for a service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services.
However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service.
The [literal]``uyuni-proxy`` CLI bundled with the package, has an [command]``update image`` command  with the following parameters:

- [literal]``-s`` for the service name
- [literal]``-t`` for the version tag
- [literal]``-r`` for the registry path

For example, use it like this:

----
uyuni-proxy update image -s httpd -t 0.1.0 -r registry.opensuse.org/uyuni
----

It would adjust a configuration file for the httpd service, taking [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni`` as the registry and [literal]``0.1.0`` as the version tag and then restart it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the proxy reset command, specifying the service with the [literal]``-s`` parameter:

----
uyuni-proxy reset -s httpd
----

This command would reset the configuration of the [literal]``httpd`` service to the global defaults and then restart it.

For more information, see the [literal]``uyuni-proxy --help``.



[[installation-proxy-containers-firewall-rules]]
== Allow network access for provided services on container host firewall

{productname} Proxy containers work as so called node-port service.
This means proxy container pod shares container host network TCP and UDP port space.
For this reason container host firewall must be configured to accept incoming traffic on ports used by {productname} Proxy containers.
Those ports are:

- 69/UDP - TFTP
- 80/TCP - HTTP
- 443/TCP - HTTPS
- 4505/TCP - Salt
- 4506/TCP - Salt
- 8022/TCP - SSH
