[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both container proxy and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server.
You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured.

[[installation-proxy-containers-services]]
== Install Container Services on the host system

[NOTE]
====
Container host to be used as a base for {productname} Proxy containers needs to be first registered as a Salt client to the {productname} Server.

For more information about registering Salt client to the {productname} Server, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
[literal]``Containers Module`` is required to be available for container host.
====

{productname} Proxy containers are using [literal]``podman`` and [literal]``systemd`` to run and manage all proxy containers.

First step is to install container control files provided by package [literal]``uyuni-proxy-systemd-services``.


[[proc-installation-proxy-containers-services]]
.Procedure: Installation Of Container Services For {productname} Proxy

. Assign [literal]``Containers Module`` software channel to the container host in the {productname}.
+
For more information about assigning software channels to the system, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].

. Log in as `root` on the container host.

. Manually install {productname} Proxy service package:
+

----
zypper install uyuni-proxy-systemd-services

[[installation-proxy-containers-customize-config]]
== Customize {productname} Proxy configuration

{productname} Proxy containers require some volumes to be mounted for long term storage.
Those volumes are automatically created by podman and can be listed using the [literal]``podman volume ls`` command.
By default, [literal]``podman`` stores the files of the volumes in [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``.
The needed volume are named:

- [path]``uyuni-proxy-squid-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache``
- [path]``uyuni-proxy-tftpboot``

To override the default volume settings, create the volumes prior to the first start of the pod using the [literal]``podman volume create`` command.

In the [path]``/etc/sysconfig/uyuni-proxy-systemd-services.config`` file it is possible to add custom arguments passed to podman container pod:

- [literal]``EXTRA_POD_ARGS=''``

In this file it is possible to modify the tag to use for the container images:

- [literal]``TAG``=[path]``latest``

=== Using a custom container image for a service

By default, the {productname} Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services. However, there's a possibility to change this behavior by overriding the default values for a specific service. The [literal]``uyuni-proxy`` CLI bundled with the package, has an [literal]``update image`` command taking the following arguments:

- [literal]``-s`` for the service name
- [literal]``-t`` for the version tag
- [literal]``-r`` for the registry path

An example usage would look like this:
----
uyuni-proxy update image -s httpd -t 0.1.0 -r registry.opensuse.org/uyuni
----
It would adjust a configuration file for the httpd service, taking [path]``registry.opensuse.org/uyuni`` as the registry and [literal]``0.1.0`` as the version tag and then restart it.

To reset the values to defaults, run the proxy reset command, specifying the service with the -s flag. An example usage would look like the following:

----
uyuni-proxy reset -s httpd
----

This command would reset the configuration of the [literal]``httpd`` service to the global defaults and restarts it.

See the [literal]``uyuni-proxy --help`` for more detail.

[[installation-proxy-containers-firewall-rules]]
== Allow network access for provided services on container host firewall

{productname} Proxy containers work as so called node-port service. This means proxy container pod shares container host network TCP and UDP port space. For this reason container host firewall must be configured to accept incoming traffic on ports used by {productname} Proxy containers. Those ports are:

- 69/UDP - TFTP
- 80/TCP - HTTP
- 443/TCP - HTTPS
- 4505/TCP - Salt
- 4506/TCP - Salt
- 8022/TCP - SSH
