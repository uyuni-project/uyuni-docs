[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|                             |  
|icon:shield-alt[role="none"] | The shield icon is a security alert.
|                             | A red shield is the highest priority security alert.
|icon:bug[role="none"]        | The bug icon is a bug fix alert.

|===


=== Interface Customization

By default, the {productname} {webui} uses the theme appropriate to the product you have installed.
You can change the theme to reflect the {uyuni} or {susemgr} colors.
The {susemgr} theme also has a dark option available.
To change the theme using the {webui}, navigate to menu:Home[My Preferences] and locate the [guimenu]``Style Theme`` section.

For information about changing the default theme, see xref:administration:users.adoc[].



=== Request Timeout Value

As you are using the {webui}, you are sending requests to the {productname} Server.
In some cases, these requests can take a long time, or fail completely.
By default, requests will time out after 30 seconds, and a message is displayed in the {webui} with a link to try sending the request again.

You can configure the default timeout value in the ``etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file, by adjusting the ``web.spa.timeout`` parameter.
Restart the tomcat service after you change this parameter.
Changing this setting to a higher number could be useful if you have a slow internet connection, or regularly perform actions on many clients at once.
