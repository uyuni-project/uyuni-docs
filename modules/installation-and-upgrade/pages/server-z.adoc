= Server - Patch Level Upgrade (Z Upgrade)

This update procedure covers simple package updates or a concerted micro update, which is also known as a maintenance update (MU).
During a MU the user stops services, updates packages, runs the script to update the database, and restarts services.

Example: [literal]``4.3.0`` → [literal]``4.3.1``.

This means first you ensure that you have the latest version of all installed packages installed.
Then you can upgrade the database schema.



.Procedure: Updating Packages on the {productname} Server

By default, several update channels are configured and enabled for the {productname} Server.
New and updated packages will become available automatically.

It is recommended you make a backup of the server before upgrading.

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, stop the spacewalk services:
+

----
spacewalk-service stop
----
+

. Refresh software repositories:
+

----
zypper ref
----
+

. List available patches:
+

----
zypper list-patches
----
+

. Apply all available patches:
+

----
zypper patch
----
+

This command only applies patches.
To apply all outstanding updates, use [command]``zypper up`` instead.

. Restart the spacewalk services:
+
----
spacewalk-service start
----

[NOTE]
====
By default, zypper refreshes the repository every ten minutes (see ``repo.refresh.delay`` in [path]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf``).
If ``autorefresh`` is disabled, run [command]``zypper ref`` to refresh all repositories.
====

[NOTE]
====
Command [command]``spacewalk-schema-upgrade`` is not needed anymore.
It will run automatically during [command]``spacewalk-service start``.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Services affected by a package update are not automatically restarted after an update.
You need to restart these services manually to avoid potential failures.
Use [command]``zypper ps`` to check for applications that are using old code and require restarting.
====

Reboot the server if a patch update recommends rebooting.
