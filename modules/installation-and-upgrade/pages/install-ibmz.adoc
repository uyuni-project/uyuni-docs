= Installing on {ibmz}


This section is intended for z/VM systems programmers responsible for operating the {ibmz} mainframes.
It assumes that you are a z/VM systems programmer trained on {ibmz} operating protocols, and steps you through installing {productname} onto an existing mainframe system.
This section does not cover the variety of hardware configuration profiles available on {ibmz}, but provides a foundational overview of the procedure and requirements necessary for a successful {productname} Server deployment on {ibmz}.

This section describes how to install {susemgr} Server using {sle} installation media.
You must have already registered your {susemgr} product with {scc}, and have obtained a registration code.

For information on registering with {scc}, retrieving your organization credentials from {scc}, or obtaining installation media, see xref:general-requirements.adoc[].



== System Requirements

Before you begin, check that your environment meets the base system requirements.

// The base system for {productname}{nbsp}{productnumber} is SLES{nbsp}{sles-version}{nbsp}{sp-version}.

.Compatible {ibmz} Systems:

* IBM zEnterprise System z196
* IBM zEnterprise System z114
* IBM zEnterprise EC12
* IBM zEnterprise EC12
* IBM zEnterprise BC12
* IBM z13
* LinuxOne Rockhopper
* LinuxOne Emperor

.Hardware Requirements
|===
| Hardware     | Recommended
| CPU          | Minimum 4 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores
| RAM:         | Test Server: Minimum 3{nbsp}GB RAM and 2{nbsp}GB Swap space
|              | Base Installation: Minimum 16{nbsp}GB
|              | Production Server: Minimum 32{nbsp}GB
| Disk Space:  | Root Partition: Minimum 100{nbsp}GB
|              | [path]``/var/lib/pgsql``: Minimum 50{nbsp}GB
|              | [path]``/var/spacewalk``: Minimum 50{nbsp}GB per SUSE product and 360{nbsp}GB per Red Hat product
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Memory should be split across available RAM, VDISK, and swap to suit your environment.
On a production system the ratio of physical memory to VDISK will need to be evaluated based on the number of clients you will be installing.
====

You will require an additional disk for database storage.
This should be an [systemitem]``zFCP`` or [systemitem]``DASD`` device as these are preferred for use with [systemitem]``HYPERPAV``.
The database storage disk should have:

* At least 50{nbsp}GB for [path]``/var/lib/pgsql``
* At least 50{nbsp}GB for each SUSE product in [path]``/var/spacewalk``
* At least 360{nbsp}GB for each Red Hat product in [path]``/var/spacewalk``

You will need to ensure you have sufficient disk storage for {productname} before running [command]``yast2 susemanager_setup``.
By default, the {productname} file system, including the embedded database and patch directories, reside within the root directory.
While adjustments are possible when installation is complete, it is important that you specify and monitor these adjustments closely.
For information on storage management and reclaiming disk space, see the troubleshooting section in the {productname} Administration Guide.

[WARNING]
====
If your {productname} runs out of disk space, this can have a severe impact on its database and file structure.
A full recovery is only possible with a previous backup or a new {productname} installation.
{suse} technical services will not be able to provide support for systems suffering from low disk space conditions.
====

.Network Requirements:

* OSA Express Ethernet (including Fast and Gigabit Ethernet)
* HiperSockets or Guest LAN
* 10{nbsp}GBE, VSWITCH
* RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE)

These interfaces are still included but no longer supported:

* CTC or virtual CTC
* IP network interface for IUCV

The z/VM guest you want to run {productname} from will require a static IP address and hostname before you begin, as these cannot easily be changed after initial installation.
The hostname should contain less than eight characters and must not contain any upper case letters.





== Install {productname} on {ibmz}

This section covers the installation of {productname} as a product of the {sle} family.
For general information about deploying a product on {ibmz} hardware, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-zseries.html.

.Procedure: Installing {susemgr} Server from a DVD Image
[role=procedure]

. Boot your system with the {unifiedinstaller}.
    If booting fails you might need to adjust the boot order in the BIOS.
. When prompted, select [guimenu]``Installation``.

Then continue as described in xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-server-unified.adoc[].

To finalize the {productname} installation see xref:installation-and-upgrade:server-setup.adoc[].
