= Supported Client Systems

Supported operating systems for traditional and Salt clients are listed in this table.

In this table, {check} indicates that clients running the operating system are supported by {suse}, and {cross} indicates that it is not supported.
Fields marked as {question} are under consideration, and may or may not be supported at a later date.

[NOTE]
====
For {suse} operating systems, the version and SP level must be under general support (normal or LTSS) to be supported with {productname}.
For details on supported product versions, see:

link:https://www.suse.com/lifecycle[]

For non-{suse} operating systems, including {rhel}, {centos}, and {oracle}, only the latest available version is under general support.

//EOL clients
include::../../client-configuration/pages/snippets/eol-clients.adoc[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
Salt SSH is using [path]``/var/tmp`` to deploy Salt Bundle to and execute Salt commands on the client with the bundled Python.
Therefore you must not mount [path]``/var/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.
It is not possible to bootstrap the clients, which have [path]``/var/tmp`` mounted with [option]``noexec`` option, with the {webui} because the bootstrap process is using Salt SSH to reach a client.
====

When you are setting up your client hardware, you need to ensure you have enough for the operating system and for the workload you want to perform on the client, with these additions for {productname}:
