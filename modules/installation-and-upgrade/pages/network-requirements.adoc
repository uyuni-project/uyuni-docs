= Network Requirements

This section details the networking and port requirements for {productname}.

Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)::
The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly.
If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause serious problems in a number of different components.
+
For more information about configuring the hostname and DNS, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-network.html#sec-network-yast-change-host.

Hostname and IP Address::
To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server.
You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured.
+
For more information about setting up a DNS server, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-dns.html.

Using a Proxy When Installing from {sle} Media::
If you are on an internal network and do not have access to {scc}, you can set up and use a proxy during installation.
+
For more information about configuring a proxy for access to {scc} during a {sle} installation, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-boot-parameters.html#sec-boot-parameters-advanced-proxy.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The hostname of {productname} must not contain uppercase letters as this may cause _jabberd_ to fail.
Choose the hostname of your {productname} server carefully.
Although changing the server name is possible and supported, it is important to plan for this change before going ahead with it.
When you change the hostname of the server, all clients attached to the server must be made aware of the change.
====


In a production environment, the {productname} Server and clients should always use a firewall.
For a comprehensive list of the required ports, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:ports.adoc[].


For more information on disconnected setup and port configuration, see xref:administration:disconnected-setup.adoc[].




== Deployment behind HTTP or HTTPS OSI level 7 proxy

Some environment enforce internet access through a HTTP or HTTPS proxy.
This could be a Squid server or similar.
To allow the {productname} Server internet access in such configuration, you need to configure the following.

.Procedure: Configuring HTTP or HTTPS OSI level 7 proxy

. For operating system internet access, modify [path]``/etc/sysconfig/proxy`` according to your needs:

+

[source,shell]
----
PROXY_ENABLED="no"
HTTP_PROXY=""
HTTPS_PROXY=""
NO_PROXY="localhost, 127.0.0.1"
----

. For ``Podman`` container internet access, modify  [path]``/etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service.d/custom.conf`` according to your needs.
  For example, set:

+

[source,shell]
----
[Service]
Environment=TZ=Europe/Berlin
Environment="PODMAN_EXTRA_ARGS="
Environment="https_proxy=user:password@http://192.168.10.1:3128"
----

. For Java application internet access, modify [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` according to your needs.
  On the container host, execute [literal]``mgrctl term`` to open a command line inside the server container:

+

--

.. Modify [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` according to your needs.
   For example, set:

+

[source,shell]
----
# Use proxy FQDN, or FQDN:port
server.satellite.http_proxy =
server.satellite.http_proxy_username =
server.satellite.http_proxy_password =
# no_proxy is a comma seperated list
server.satellite.no_proxy =
----

--

+

. On the container host, restart the server to enforce the new configuration:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl restart uyuni-server.service
----
