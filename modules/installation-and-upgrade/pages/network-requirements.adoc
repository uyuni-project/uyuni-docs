This section details the networking and port requirements for {productname}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
IP forwarding will be enabled by containerized installation.
This means {productname} Server and Proxies will behave as a router.
This behavior is done by podman directly.
Podman containers do not run if IP forwarding is disabled.

Consider achieving network isolation of the {productname} environment according to your policies.

For more information, see https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020166.
====


== Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly.
If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause serious problems in a number of different components.

For more information about configuring the hostname and DNS, see {sles-base-os-documentation}/cha-network.html#sec-network-yast-change-host.

== Hostname and IP Address
To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server.
You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured.

For more information about setting up a DNS server, see {sles-base-os-documentation}/cha-dns.html.


== Reenable router advertisements

When the {productname} is installed using [command]``mgradm install podman`` or [command]``mgrpxy install podman``, it sets up Podman which enables IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding.
This is needed for communication from the outside of the container.

However, if your system previously had [literal]``/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/accept_ra`` set to [literal]``1``, it will stop using router advertisements.
As a result, the routes are no longer obtained via router advertisements and the default IPv6 route is missing.

To recover correct functioning of the IPv6 routing, follow the procedure:

.Procedure: Reenabling router advertisements
. Create a file in [path]``/etc/sysctl.d``, for example [literal]``99-ipv6-ras.conf``.
. Add the following parameter and value to the file:

+
----
net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_ra = 2
----
. Reboot.


== Deployment behind HTTP or HTTPS OSI level 7 proxy

Some environments enforce internet access through a HTTP or HTTPS proxy.
This could be a Squid server or similar.
To allow the {productname} Server internet access in such configuration, you need to configure the following.

.Procedure: Configuring HTTP or HTTPS OSI level 7 proxy

. For operating system internet access, modify [path]``/etc/sysconfig/proxy`` according to your needs:

+

[source,shell]
----
PROXY_ENABLED="no"
HTTP_PROXY=""
HTTPS_PROXY=""
NO_PROXY="localhost, 127.0.0.1"
----

. For ``Podman`` container internet access, modify  [path]``/etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service.d/custom.conf`` according to your needs.
  For example, set:

+

[source,shell]
----
[Service]
Environment=TZ=Europe/Berlin
Environment="PODMAN_EXTRA_ARGS="
Environment="https_proxy=user:password@http://192.168.10.1:3128"
----

. For Java application internet access, modify [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` according to your needs.
  On the container host, execute [literal]``mgrctl term`` to open a command line inside the server container:

+

--

.. Modify [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` according to your needs.
   For example, set:

+

[source,shell]
----
# Use proxy FQDN, or FQDN:port
server.satellite.http_proxy =
server.satellite.http_proxy_username =
server.satellite.http_proxy_password =
# no_proxy is a comma seperated list
server.satellite.no_proxy =
----

--

+

. On the container host, restart the server to enforce the new configuration:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl restart uyuni-server.service
----



== Air-gapped Deployment
If you are on an internal network and do not have access to {scclongform}, you can use an xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-air-gapped-deployment-mlm.adoc[Air-gapped Deployment].


In a production environment, the {productname} Server and clients should always use a firewall.
For a comprehensive list of the required ports, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:network-requirements.adoc#ports[].


//For more information on disconnected setup and port configuration, see xref:administration:disconnected-setup.adoc[].

[[ports]]
== Required Network Ports

This section contains a comprehensive list of ports that are used for various communications within {productname}.

You will not need to open all of these ports.
Some ports only need to be opened if you are using the service that requires them.



=== Overview

==== Server

==== Proxy

=== External Inbound Server Ports

External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Server to protect the server from unauthorized access.

Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the {productname} Server.

// | 22          |          |            | Only required if the user wants to manage the server host with {salt} SSH.

=== External Outbound Server Ports

External outbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Server to restrict what the server can access.

Opening these ports allows network traffic from the {productname} Server to communicate with external services.

=== Internal Server Ports

Internal ports are used internally by the {productname} Server.
Internal ports are only accessible from [literal]``localhost``.

In most cases, you will not need to adjust these ports.

| Port number | Notes
| 2828        | Satellite-search API, used by the RHN application in Tomcat and Taskomatic.

|===


Port 32768 and higher are used as ephemeral ports.
These are most often used to receive TCP connections.
When a TCP connection request is received, the sender will choose one of these ephemeral port numbers to match the destination port.

You can use this command to find out which ports are ephemeral ports:

----
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
----



=== External Inbound Proxy Ports

External inbound ports must be opened to configure a firewall on the {productname} Proxy to protect the proxy from unauthorized access.

Opening these ports allows external network traffic to access the {productname} proxy.

=== Required URLs

There are some URLs that {productname} must be able to access to register clients and perform updates.
In most cases, allowing access to these URLs is sufficient:

* [literal]``scc.suse.com``
* [literal]``updates.suse.com``
* [literal]``installer-updates.suse.com``
* [literal]``registry.suse.com``
* [literal]``registry-storage.suse.com``

You can find additional details on whitelisting the specified URLs and their associated IP addresses in this article: https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021034[Accessing {scclongform} and SUSE registry behind a firewall and/or through a proxy].

If you are using non-{suse} clients you might also need to allow access to other servers that provide specific packages for those operating systems.
For example, if you have {ubuntu} clients, you will need to be able to access the {ubuntu} server.

For more information about troubleshooting firewall access for non-{suse} clients, see xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-firewalls.adoc[].
