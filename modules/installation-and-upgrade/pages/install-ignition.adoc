== {productname} Basic Configuration Using [systemitem]``Ignition``

[systemitem]``Ignition`` is a provisioning tool that enables you to configure a system according to your specification on the first boot.
When the system is booted for the first time, [systemitem]``Ignition`` is loaded as part of an initramfs and searches for a configuration file within a specific directory (on a USB flash disk, or you can provide a URL).

[systemitem]``Ignition`` uses a configuration file in the JSON format.
The file is called [path]``config.ign``.

The [path]``config.ign`` is a JSON configuration file that provides prescriptions for Ignition.
You can either create the file manually in JSON, or you can use the Fuel Ignition tool to generate a basic set of prescriptions.
The Fuel Ignition tool does not provide a full set of options, so you might have to modify the file manually.
For more information, see https://ignite.opensuse.org/.

When installing, the configuration file [path]``config.ign`` must reside in the [path]``ignition`` subdirectory on the configuration media labeled [systemitem]``ignition``.
The directory structure must look as follows:

----
<root directory>
└── ignition
    └── config.ign
----

If you intend to configure a QEMU/KVM virtual machine, provide the path to the [path]``config.ign`` file as an attribute of the qemu command.
For example:

----
-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=PATH_TO_config.ign
----

The [path]``config.ign`` file contains various data types: objects, strings, integers, booleans, and lists of objects.
For the complete specification, see https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_3/.



=== Set Root Password Using [systemitem]``Ignition``

The {productname} VM image does not set up root or any other user account.
User or [systemitem]``root`` authentications need to be set up during first boot.
The [literal]``passwd`` attribute is used to add users.
If you intend to log in the system, create root and set the root's password and/or add the SSH key to the [systemitem]``Ignition`` configuration.
You need to hash the root password, for example, by using the [command]``openssl`` command:

----
openssl passwd -6
----

The command creates a hash of the password you chose.
Use this hash as the value of the [literal]``passwordHash`` attribute.

The users attribute must contain at least one [literal]``name`` attribute.
[literal]``ssh_authorized_keys`` is a list of ssh keys for the user.

Create the [path]``root/ignition/config.ign`` file with the following content:

----
{
  "ignition": {
    "version": "3.2.0"
  },
  "passwd": {
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "root",
        "passwordHash": "$2a$10$qV298UV11u9lCFDjpHpCUe1cErBiVR.G3shukxs3.2PAO1xhJWs0K"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Prepare the [systemitem]``Ignition`` ISO file using the command:

----
mkisofs -full-iso9660-filenames -o suma_ignition.iso -V ignition root
----

Attach the created [path]``suma_ignition.iso`` file as a volume to the virtual machine at first boot.
This particular example is setting the [systemitem]``root`` password to `linux`.
Substitute your password hash for the one in this example.
