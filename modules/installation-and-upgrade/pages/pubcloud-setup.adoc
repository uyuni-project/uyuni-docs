= Public Cloud Setup

{productname} Server needs to be registered with {scc} to receive updates before you can sign in.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must have set up the storage devices before you run the YaST {productname} setup procedure.
For more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].
====

Follow the cloud providers instructions to SSH into the instance, and run this command to start set up:

----
yast2 susemanager_setup
----

Follow the prompts, and wait for the setup to finish.

For detailed instructions on setting up {productname} with {yast}, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:server-setup.adoc[].




== Activate the public cloud module

To use {productname} on a public cloud instance, you need to activate the public cloud module.



.Procedure: Activating the public cloud module
. On the {productname} Server, open the {yast} management tool, and navigate to menu:Software[Software Repositories].
. Click btn:[Add] and select [guimenu]``Extensions and Modules from Registration Server``.
. In the [guimenu]``Available extensions`` field, select [guimenu]``Public Cloud Module``.

If you prefer to use the command line, you can add the module with this command:
----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-public-cloud/15.3/x86_64
----

When the installation procedure has finished, you can check that you have all the required modules.
At the command prompt, enter:

----
SUSEConnect --status-text
----

For {productname} Server on a public cloud, the expected modules are:

* {sles} Basesystem Module
* Python 2 Module
* Server Applications Module
* Web and Scripting Module
* SUSE Manager Server Module
* Public Cloud Module



== Complete setup in the {webui}

Open the {productname} {webui} with a web browser, using an address like this:

----
https://<public_IP>
----

Sign in to the {productname} {webui} with the administrator account.
The username and password varies depending on your provider.

.Default Administrator Account Details
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Provider              | Default Username  | Default Password
| Amazon EC2            | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Google Compute Engine | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Microsoft Azure       | ``admin``         | ``<instance-name>-suma``
|===

You can retrieve the instance name or ID from the public cloud instance web console, or from the command prompt:

Amazon EC2:

----
ec2metadata --instance-id
----

Google Compute Engine:

----
gcemetadata --query instance --id
----

Microsoft Azure:

----
azuremetadata --compute --name
----


When you sign in to the administrator account for the first time, you are given an automatically generated organization name.
Change this by navigating to menu:Admin[Organizations], and editing the organization name.


[IMPORTANT]
====
When you have signed in to the administrator account for the first time, change the default password to protect your account.

[[add-product-sync-repo]]
== Adding Products and Starting Repositories Synchronization

Use the {productname} {webui} to add the required software products, and schedule a repository synchronization.
The best way to do this is to navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and follow the prompts.

For more information about the setup wizard, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:setup-wizard.adoc[].


If you are intending to register {ubuntu} or {rhel} clients, you need to set up custom repositories and channels.
For more information, see the relevant section in xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].


To synchronize your channels, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].
Click each channel you created, navigate to the menu:Repositories[Sync] tab, and click btn:[Sync Now].
You can also schedule synchronization from this screen.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Before bootstrapping a client, make sure all the selected channels for that product are synchronized.

Synchronization can sometimes take several hours, in particular for openSUSE, SLES ES, and RHEL channels.
====


When you have your {productname} Server set up, you are ready to start registering clients.
For more information about registering clients on a public cloud, see xref:client-configuration:clients-pubcloud.adoc[].
