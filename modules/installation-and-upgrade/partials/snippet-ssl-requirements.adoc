SSL certificates are needed at a later stage.
If not using the self-signed generated CA and certificates, ensure you have the following before starting:

* A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate.
  If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available.
* An SSL database private key
* An SSL database certificate

All files must be in PEM format.

The hostname of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on.
You can set the hostnames in the [literal]``X509v3 Subject Alternative Name`` section of the certificate.
You can also list multiple hostnames if your environment requires it.
Supported Key types are [literal]``RSA`` and [literal]``EC`` (Elliptic Curve).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Database SSL certificate requires [literal]``reportdb`` and [literal]``db`` and the FQDN used to access the report database as [literal]``Subject Alternative Name``.
