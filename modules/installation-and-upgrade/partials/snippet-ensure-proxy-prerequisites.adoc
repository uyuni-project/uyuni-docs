:description: Learn how to prepare the proxy host to be used as proxy
== Install packages and enable podman

Before using proxy, some packages need to be present on host and [package]``podman`` needs to be running.


.Procedure: Preparing the prerequisites
[role=procedure]
_____

. On the proxy host, ensure that the following packages are installed:

* [package]``podman``
* [package]``mgrpxy-bash-completion``
* [package]``suse-multi-linux-manager-<version>-<arch>-proxy-httpd-image``
* [package]``suse-multi-linux-manager-<version>-<arch>-proxy-salt-broker-image``
* [package]``suse-multi-linux-manager-<version>-<arch>-proxy-squid-image``
* [package]``suse-multi-linux-manager-<version>-<arch>-proxy-ssh-image``
* [package]``suse-multi-linux-manager-<version>-<arch>-proxy-tftpd-image``

+

For example, for version 5.1 and architecture of x86_64, the package name would be [package]``suse-multi-linux-manager-5.1-x86_64-proxy-httpd-image``.

+

. Start the Podman service on the proxy host by rebooting the system, or running a command:

+

[source, shell]
----
systemctl enable --now podman.service
----

. On the proxy host, install the Proxy with:

+

----
mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz
----
