[server-major-upgrade]
= Server - Major Upgrade

If {productname} core compontents are upgraded to new major versions, {productname} Server upgrades are considered as major.
This is the case, if a version upgrade of PostgreSQL, Salt, or openSUSE Leap is needed.
openSUSE Leap is the underlying base operating system (OS).
For background information about upgrading openSUSE Leap, see https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/startup/single-html/book-opensuse-startup/index.html#sec-update-zypper.

Run the [command]``/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/server-migrator.sh`` script to upgrade the base OS and {productname} Server.

[NOTE]
====
Before running the [command]``server-migrator.sh`` script, check whether the most recent version of the [package]``susemanager`` package is installed:
+
----
zypper ref
zypper up susemanager
----
====

The [command]``server-migrator.sh`` script will migrate {productname} Server to the latest version.
This implies upgrading the underlying operating system to version 15.2.

// During migration the services need to be shut down and after successful migration the server needs to be rebooted manually.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because you cannot fix any issues during migration, make sure you have a backup before starting the migration.
If you are running {productname} Server on a virtual machine, it is recommended to create a snapshot before performing the migration.

.Procedure: Migrating to {productname} 4.1

The script runs as [systemitem]``root`` and performs the following actions.


. Stop the spacewalk services:
+
----
spacewalk-service stop
----

. Move away the old repository configuration:
+
----
mv /etc/zypp/repos.d /etc/zypp/repos.d.old
mkdir /etc/zypp/repos.d
----

. Enable and refresh new repositories:
+
----
zypper ar -n "Main Repository" http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.2/repo/oss repo-oss
zypper ar -n "Main Update Repository" http://download.opensuse.org/update/leap/15.2/oss repo-update
zypper ar -n "Non-OSS Repository" http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.2/repo/non-oss repo-non-oss
zypper ar -n "Update Repository (Non-Oss)" http://download.opensuse.org/update/leap/15.2/non-oss/ repo-update-non-oss
zypper ar -n "Uyuni Server Stable" https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-x86_64-Media1/ uyuni-server-stable

zypper ref
----

. Perform the distribution upgrade:
+
----
zypper -n dup --allow-vendor-change
----

. To migrate the database to PostgreSQL 12 run the migrate script:
+
----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-10-to-12.sh
----
+
For more information about PostgreSQL database migration, see xref:db-migration-12.adoc[].


Finally reboot the system.
This is not part of the script.
Initiate the reboot manually:

----
shutdown -r now
----

[NOTE]
====
[command]``spacewalk-schema-upgrade`` is not needed anymore.
It will be run during [command]``spacewalk-service start`` automatically.
