[[db-migration-13]]
= Database Migration from Version 10 or 12 to 13

This section covers upgrading the PostgreSQL database from version{nbsp}10 or version{nbsp}12 to version{nbsp}13.
If you are already using PostgreSQL 13, you do not need to perform this migration.
If you are using an older version, such as version 9.6, see xref:upgrade:db-migration-10.adoc[].

If you want to upgrade to the latest {productname} version, you must be using PostgreSQL version 12 or 13, depending on the underlying operating system:

* If you are running SLES 15 SP3, use PostgreSQL 13.
* If you are running Leap 15.2, use PostgreSQL 12.



[[db-migration-13-prepare]]
== Prepare to Upgrade

Before you begin the upgrade, prepare your existing {productname} Server and create a database backup.

PostgreSQL stores data at [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data/``.



.Procedure: Preparing to Upgrade
. Check the active PostgreSQL version:
+
----
psql --version
----
+
If you are using PostgreSQL{nbsp}10 or 12, you can upgrade to PostgreSQL{nbsp}13.
If you are already using PostgreSQL version 13, you do not need to perform this migration.
. Check the active smdba version:
+
----
rpm -q smdba
----
+
PostgreSQL{nbsp}13 requires ``smdba`` version 1.7.6 or later.
. Perform a database backup.
  For more information on backing up, see xref:administration:backup-restore.adoc[].



[[db-migration-13-upgrade]]
== Upgrade PostgreSQL

[WARNING]
====
Always create a database backup before performing a migration.
====

PostgreSQL upgrades can be performed in two ways: a regular upgrade, or a fast upgrade:

A regular upgrade creates a complete copy of the database, so you need double the existing database size of space available.
Regular upgrades can take a considerable amount of time, depending on the size of the database and the speed of the storage system.

A fast upgrade only takes a few minutes, and uses almost no additional disk space.
However, if a fast upgrade fails, you must restore the database from the backup.
A fast upgrade reduces the risk of running out of disk space, but increases the
risk of data lose when a backup does not exist or cannot be replayed.
A regular upgrade will copy the database files instead of creating hard links between the files.

PostgreSQL stores data at [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data/``.



.Procedure: Performing a Regular Upgrade
. Perform a database backup.
  For more information on backing up, see xref:administration:backup-restore.adoc[].
. Start the upgrade.
  If you have version 12, run:
+
----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-12-to-13.sh
----
+
  If you have version 10, run:
+
----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-10-to-13.sh
----
. When the upgrade has successfully completed, you can safely delete the old database directory and reclaim lost disk space.
  The old directory is renamed to [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data-pg12`` or [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data-pg10``, depending on the version you started from.

The [path]``pg-migrate-12-to-13.sh`` or [path]``pg-migrate-10-to-13.sh`` script performs these operations:

* Stop spacewalk services
* Shut down the running database
* Check if PostgreSQL{nbsp}13 is installed and install it if necessary
* Switch from previous version of PostgreSQL{nbsp} to PostgreSQL{nbsp}13 as the new default
* Initiate the database migration
* Create a PostgreSQL configuration file tuned for use by {productname}
* Start the database and spacewalk services

[NOTE]
====
If the upgrade fails, the migration script will attempt to restore the database to its original state.
====



.Procedure: Performing a Fast PostgreSQL Upgrade
. Perform a database backup.
  Without a verified database backup, you must not initiate a fast upgrade.
  For more information on backing up, see xref:administration:backup-restore.adoc[].
. Start the upgrade.
  If you are migrating from version 12:
+
----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-12-to-13.sh fast
----
+ 
  If you are migrating from version 10:
+
----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-10-to-13.sh fast
----
. When the upgrade has successfully completed, you can safely delete the old database directory and reclaim lost disk space.
  The old directory is renamed to [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data-pg12`` or [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data-pg10``, depending on the version you started from..
