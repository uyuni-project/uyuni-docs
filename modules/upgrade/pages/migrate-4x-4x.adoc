[[bp.sp.migration.version]]
= Upgrading from Version 4 to 4.x

You can upgrade {productname} from version 4 to 4.x (when available) using either the {yast} online migration tool or the Zypper command line tool.
This procedure is also known as SP migration (service pack migration).
This procedure does not replace the server with an updated copy.
It is an in-place upgrade.

Example: [literal]``4.0.x`` → [literal]``4.1.0``.

// So on my desktop, YaST calls it "online upgrades". We should check this terminology. LKB 2019-08-21
// On SLE, it's migration. ke 2020-03-05

The upgrade from version 4 to 4.1 will also upgrade the base OS from SLES 15 SP1 to SLES 15 SP2​, and the PostgreSQL database from version{nbsp}10 to 12 with an additional step.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrades should be run from a text console, rather than a graphical interface like GNOME.
If you are logged into a GNOME session running on the machine you are going to migrate, you will need to switch to a text console.
This does not apply if you are logged in from a remote machine (unless you are running a VNC session with GNOME).
====


== Upgrade Using {yast}

To perform the upgrade with {yast}, use the Online Migration tool.

[NOTE]
====
If {yast} does not have the Online Migration tool available, install the [package]``yast2-migration`` package and all the required packages.
After installing, restart {yast} to ensure the tool is available within {yast}.
====



.Procedure: Upgrading with {yast}

. From the command prompt, as root, launch the {yast} online migration tool:
+

----
yast2 migration
----
+
If there are older updates available, {yast} will notify you and ask to install them first.
You must install all package updates before performing the migration.
For more information, see xref:server-update.adoc[].

TODO:
2019-10-01, ke:
With the advent of SLE 15 SP2 or SUMA 4.1 we probably must enhance this;
For more info, see the maintenance/3.2 branch!
Enhance the zypper section below accordingly
////
+
{yast} will show the possible migration targets with detailed summaries.
// I've removed the graphical option, because we tell people to use a text console. LKB 2019-08-21
. Select the appropriate target, and follow the prompts to complete the migration.
. Reboot the server.
. When rebooted the spacewalk services are not running until you have migrated
the PostgreSQL database to version{nbsp}12.
. Ensure the spacewalk services are running:
+
----
spacewalk-service start
----


// Does this also apply if you use zypper?  If yes, we must repeat this
// sentence below.
During the upgrade, {yast} will install all recommended packages.
This can significantly increase the installation size of the system.
To only install required packages, open the [path]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` configuration file and set these variables:

----
solver.onlyRequires = true
installRecommends = false
----

This changes the behavior of all future package operations.



== Upgrade Using Zypper

To perform the upgrade with Zypper, use the Zypper migration tool.


.Procedure: Upgrading with Zypper
. From the command prompt, as root, launch the Zypper migration tool:
+
----
zypper migration
----
Zypper will show the possible migration targets with detailed summaries.
. Select the appropriate target, and follow the prompts to complete the migration.
. Reboot the server.
. Ensure the spacewalk services are running:
+
----
spacewalk-service start
----


If the process fails, check these issues first:

* If Zypper does not have the migration tool available, install the [package]``zypper-migration-plugin`` package.
* If there are older updates available, Zypper will notify you and ask to install them first.
You must install all updates before performing the upgrade.



== Database Schema Upgrade

Most likely, you also must upgrade the database schema.
For more information, see xref:server-update.adoc[], Procedure "Upgrading the Database Schema".
