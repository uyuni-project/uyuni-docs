= Upgrade the Proxy

{productname} Proxies are managed in the same way as clients.
ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
Maintenance updates (MU) can be installed on a {productname} Proxy in the same way as other clients.
MU updates require a restart of the proxy service.
endif::[]

Before you perform any proxy update, schedule a maintenance window.
The clients registered to {productname} through the proxy will not be able to connect to {productname} while the update is in progress.
For more information about maintenance windows, see xref:administration:maintenance-windows.adoc[].

{productname} uses an [literal]``X.Y.Z`` versioning schema.
To determine which upgrade procedure you need, look at which part of the version number is changing.
