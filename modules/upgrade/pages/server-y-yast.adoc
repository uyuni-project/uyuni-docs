= Server - Minor Version Upgrade with {yast}

To perform the upgrade with {yast}, use the Online Migration tool.

[NOTE]
====
If {yast} does not have the Online Migration tool available, install the [package]``yast2-migration`` package and all the required packages.
After installing, restart {yast} to ensure the tool is available within {yast}.
====


[NOTE]
====
Before upgrading from {productname} 4.0 to 4.1, ensure you do not have any unpublished packages.
Check for unpublished packages by navigating to menu:Patches[Manage Patches > Unpublished].
You must publish or delete them before you upgrade.

.Procedure: Upgrading with {yast}

. From the command prompt, as root, launch the {yast} online migration tool:
+

----
yast2 migration
----
+
If there are older updates available, {yast} will notify you and ask to install them first.
You must install all package updates before performing the migration.
For more information, see xref:upgrade:server-z.adoc[].
+
{yast} will show the possible migration targets with detailed summaries.
// I've removed the graphical option, because we tell people to use a text console. LKB 2019-08-21
. Select the appropriate target, and follow the prompts to complete the migration.
. Reboot the server.
. When rebooted the spacewalk services are not running until you have migrated the PostgreSQL database to version{nbsp}12.
. Log in on the text console as root, and run the database migration script:
+
----
/usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-10-to-12.sh
----
. Ensure the spacewalk services are running:
+
----
spacewalk-service start
----
+
[NOTE]
====
[command]``spacewalk-schema-upgrade`` is not needed anymore.
It will be run during [command]``spacewalk-service start`` automatically.
====


// Does this also apply if you use zypper?  If yes, we must repeat this
// sentence below.
During the upgrade, {yast} will install all recommended packages.
This can significantly increase the installation size of the system.
To only install required packages, open the [path]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` configuration file and set these variables:

----
solver.onlyRequires = true
installRecommends = false
----

This changes the behavior of all future package operations.
