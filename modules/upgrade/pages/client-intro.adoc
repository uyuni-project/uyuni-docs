= Upgrade the Clients


Clients use the versioning system of their underlying operating system.
For clients using {suse} operating systems, you can perform upgrades within the {productname} {webui}.

To upgrade clients running SLE{nbsp}12 to SLE{nbsp}15, the upgrade is automated, but you will need to do some preparation steps before you begin.

For supported {sle}{nbsp}15 upgrade paths, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html
