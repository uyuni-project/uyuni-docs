{productname} has three main components, all of which need regular updates.
This guide covers updating the {productname} Server, Proxy, and clients, as well as some underlying components, such as the database.

It is possible to automate some of the upgrades, but others need to be performed manually.

[NOTE]
====
This guide is not intended to be read cover to cover.
Instead, navigate to the component you want to upgrade, then identify the versions you are upgrading from and to.

{productname} uses an [literal]``X.Y.Z`` versioning schema.
To determine which upgrade procedure you need, look at which part of the version number is changing.

X upgrades::
Upgrading to the next major version.
For example, upgrading from 3.2 to 4.0.

Y upgrades::
Upgrading to the next minor version.
This is often referred to as a service pack migration.
For example, upgrading from 4.0 to 4.1.

Z upgrades::
Upgrading within the same minor version.
This is often referred to as a maintenance update.
For example, upgrading from 4.0.0 to 4.0.2.

If you are updating a {productname} Proxy, see xref:upgrade:proxy-intro.adoc[].

If you are updating clients, see xref:upgrade:client-intro.adoc[].

In addition to updating the server, you need to update other underlying technologies, including the database.
For more information about updating the database, see xref:upgrade:db-intro.adoc[].
