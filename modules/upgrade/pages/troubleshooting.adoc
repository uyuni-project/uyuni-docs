== Not Enough Disk Space

Check the available disk space before you begin migration.
We recommend locating [path]``/var/spacewalk`` and [path]``/var/lib/pgsql`` on separate XFS file systems.

When you are setting up a separate file system, edit [path]``/etc/fstab`` and remove the [path]``/var/lib/pqsql`` subvolume.
Reboot the server to pick up the changes.



== Retrying to Set up the Target System

If you need to retry setting up the target system, follow these steps:

. Delete [path]``/root/.MANAGER_SETUP_COMPLETE``.
. Stop PostgreSQL and remove [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data``.
. Set the target system hostname to match the source system hostname.
. Check the [path]``/etc/hosts`` file, and correct it if necessary.
. Check [path]``/etc/setup_env.sh`` on the target system, and ensure the database name is set:
+
----
MANAGER_DB_NAME='susemanager'
----
. Reboot the target system.
. Run [command]``mgr-setup`` again.



== Schema Upgrade Fails

If the schema upgrade fails, the database version check and all the other spacewalk services do not start.
Run [command]``spacewalk-service start`` for more information and hints how to proceed.

You can also run the version check directly:

----
systemctl status uyuni-check-database.service
----

or

----
journalctl -u uyuni-check-database.service
----

These commands print debug information if you do not want to run the more general [command]``spacewalk-service`` command.



== The {webui} Fails to Load

Sometimes, the {webui} will not load after migration.
This is usually caused by browser caching, if the new system has the same hostname and IP address as the old system.
This duplication can confuse some browsers.

This issue is resolved by clearing the cache and reloading the page.
In most browsers, you can do this quickly by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+F5].
