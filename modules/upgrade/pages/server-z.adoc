= Server - Z Upgrade

This update procedure covers simple package updates or a concerted micro update, which is also known as a maintenance update (MU).
During a MU the user stops services, updates packages, runs the script to update the database, and restarts services.

Example: [literal]``4.1.1`` → [literal]``4.1.2``.

This means first you ensure that you have the latest version of all installed packages installed.
Then you can upgrade the database schema.

====
Services affected by a package update are not automatically restarted after an update.
You need to restart these services manually to avoid potential failures.
Use [command]``zypper ps`` to check for applications that are using old code and require restarting.

Reboot the server if a patch update recommends rebooting.
