= Update {productname} Proxy

{productname} Proxies are managed in the same way as clients.
Maintenance updates (MU) can be installed on a {productname} Proxy in the same way as other clients.
MU updates require a restart of the proxy service.

// a remote command (or a salt state) can perform the restart.
// Creating an Action Chain can help with this task.
// With an action chain you can update proxies on batches, or all at the same time:
// These are the basic steps to run:
////
1. Run a salt command: `spacewalk-proxy stop`
2. Update the packages
3. Run a salt command: `spacewalk-proxy start`
////



== Prepare to Update

Before you perform any proxy update, schedule a maintenance window.
The clients registered to {productname} through the proxy will not be able to connect to {productname} while the update is in progress.
For more information about maintenance windows, see xref:administration:maintenance-window.adoc[].




== Update the Proxy

To update a proxy you first stop the proxy service, then update the software and finally restart the proxy service.

.Procedure: Updating the {productname} Proxy

. On the {productname} Proxy, stop the proxy service:
+
----
spacewalk-proxy stop
----

. In the {productname} Server {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Proxy] and click the name of the proxy.

. Select packages to be updated on the proxy, and then apply the selection.

. On the {productname} Proxy, start the proxy service:
+
----
spacewalk-proxy start

If you need to update many proxies, you can create an action chain of this command sequence on the {productname} Server.
You can use the action chain to perform updates on multiple proxies at the same time.
