= Server - Minor Version Upgrade (Y Upgrade)

You can upgrade {productname} to the next minor version using either the {yast} online migration tool or the Zypper command line tool.
This is often referred to as a product migration, service pack migration, or SP migration.
This procedure does not replace the server with an updated copy.
It is an in-place upgrade.

Example: [literal]``4.2.x`` → [literal]``4.3.0`` or [literal]``4.1.x`` → [literal]``4.3.0`

The upgrade from version 4.1 to 4.3 will also upgrade the base OS from SLES 15 SP2 to SLES 15 SP4​, and the PostgreSQL database from version{nbsp}12 to 14 with an additional step.
For more information about the database upgrade, see xref:upgrade:db-migration-xy.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrades should be run from a text console, rather than a graphical interface like GNOME.
If you are logged into a GNOME session running on the machine you are going to migrate, you will need to switch to a text console.
This does not apply if you are logged in from a remote machine (unless you are running a VNC session with GNOME).
