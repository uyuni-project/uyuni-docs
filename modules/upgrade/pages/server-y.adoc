= Server - Minor Version Upgrade (Y Upgrade)

You can upgrade {productname} to the next minor version using either the {yast} online migration tool or the Zypper command line tool.
This procedure is also known as product or SP migration (service pack migration).
This procedure does not replace the server with an updated copy.
It is an in-place upgrade.

Example: [literal]``4.1.x`` → [literal]``4.2.0`` or [literal]``4.0.x`` → [literal]``4.2.0`

The upgrade from version 4.0 to 4.2 will also upgrade the base OS from SLES 15 SP1 to SLES 15 SP3​, and the PostgreSQL database from version{nbsp}10 to 13 with an additional step.
For more information about the database upgrade, see xref:upgrade:db-migration-13.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrades should be run from a text console, rather than a graphical interface like GNOME.
If you are logged into a GNOME session running on the machine you are going to migrate, you will need to switch to a text console.
This does not apply if you are logged in from a remote machine (unless you are running a VNC session with GNOME).
