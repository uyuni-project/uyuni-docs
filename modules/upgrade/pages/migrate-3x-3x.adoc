The migration can either be done with the Online Migration tool ({yast}) or with the Zypper command line tool.

.Requirements
{productname} {productnumber} requires {slsa} 12 SP3 or later, with PostgreSQL version 9.6.
Check the release notes for more information about these requirements.
If you want to upgrade from an earlier version of {productname}, check the relevant product documentation.

[NOTE]
.Reduce Installation Size
====
When performing the migration, {yast} will install all recommended packages.
Especially in the case of custom minimal installations, this may increase the installation size of the system significantly.

To change this default behavior and allow only required packages, adjust [path]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` and set the following variable:

----
solver.onlyRequires = true
installRecommends=false # or commented
----

This changes the behavior of all package operations, such as the installation of patches or new packages.

[[bp.sp.migration.version.yast]]
== Using {yast}

[WARNING]
.Checking PostgreSQL Version
====
Before migrating to SLES 12 SP3 or later, check whether PostgreSQL is already updated to version 9.6.
For more information, see <<bp.postgresql.database.migration>>.
====

To perform the migration with {yast}, use the menu:Online Migration[] tool:

.Procedure: Migrating using {yast}
. If you are logged into a GNOME session running on the machine you are going to update, switch to a text console.
Running the update from within a GNOME session is not recommended.
This does not apply when being logged in from a remote machine (unless you are running a VNC session with GNOME).

. Start in {yast}menu:System[Online Migration] ([command]``yast2 migration``).
{yast} will show possible migration targets with detailed summaries.
+

In case of trouble, resolve the following issues first:
+

** If the menu:Online Migration[] is not available, install the [package]#yast2-migration# package and its dependencies.
Restart {yast} , otherwise the newly installed module will not be shown in the control center.

** If there are "`old`" online updates available for installation, the migration tool will warn and ask to install them now before starting the actual migration.
It is recommended to install all updates before proceeding.



[[bp.sp.migration.version.zypper]]
== Using zypper


[WARNING]
.Checking PostgreSQL Version
====
Before migrating to SLES 12 SP3 or later, check whether PostgreSQL is already updated to version 9.6.
For more information, see <<bp.postgresql.database.migration>>.
====


To perform the migration with Zypper on the command-line, use the [command]``zypper migration`` subcommand tool:

.Procedure: Migrating using [command]``zypper migration``
. If you are logged into a GNOME session running on the machine you are going to update, switch to a text console.
Running the update from within a GNOME session is not recommended.
This does not apply when being logged in from a remote machine (unless you are running a VNC session with GNOME).

. The [command]``zypper migration`` subcommand show possible migration targets and a summary.
+

In case of trouble, resolve the following issues first:
+

** If the [command]``migration`` subcommand is not available install the [package]#zypper-migration-plugin# package and its dependencies.
** If there are "`old`" online updates available for installation, the migration tool will warn and ask to install them now before starting the actual migration.
It is recommended to install all updates before proceeding.

. If more than one migration target is available for your system, select one from the list (specify the number).

. Read the notification and update the {productname} database schema as described ([command]``spacewalk-schema-upgrade``).

. Make sure {productname} is up and running ([command]``spacewalk-service start``).

After finishing the migration procedure {productname} 3.2 on {slsa} 12 SP3 or later is available to be used.
