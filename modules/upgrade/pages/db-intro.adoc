= Upgrade the Database

To successfully perform a major {productname} update, you might need to upgrade the underlying database.

If you are using PostgreSQL 9, and you are upgrading to version 10, see xref:upgrade:db-migration-10.adoc[].
If you are using PostgreSQL 10, and you are upgrading to version 12, see xref:upgrade:db-migration-12.adoc[].


If you want to upgrade to the latest {productname} version, you must be using PostgreSQL version 10 or 12.
If you are using an older version, such as version 9.6, you must migrate PostgreSQL to version 10 before you begin the {productname} migration.
// 2019-10-16, ke: I think we'd better keep the info on 9.4 for the moment

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you run PostgreSQL{nbsp}9.4 on {productname} 3.2, see the product documentation at https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suma/3.2/susemanager-best-practices/html/book.suma.best.practices/bp.sp.migration.html#sp.migration.postgresql.
You cannot migrate directly from PostgreSQL{nbsp}9.4 to version 10.
