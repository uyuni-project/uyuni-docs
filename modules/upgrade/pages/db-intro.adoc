[[db-migration]]
= Upgrade the Database

To successfully perform a major {productname} update, you might need to upgrade the underlying database.

//If you want to upgrade to the latest {productname} version, you must be using PostgreSQL version 10 or 12. 
To upgrade to the latest PostgreSQL, see xref:upgrade:db-migration-xy.adoc[].


This table shows the PostgreSQL version required for each version of {productname} and {SLES}:

// 2019-10-16, ke: I think we'd better keep the info on 9.4 for the moment
[NOTE]
====
If you are using an older database version, such as version 9.4 or 9.6, you must migrate PostgreSQL to version 10 before you begin the {productname} migration. To upgrade from PostgreSQL 9 to version 10, see https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suma/4.1/suse-manager/upgrade/db-migration-10.html
