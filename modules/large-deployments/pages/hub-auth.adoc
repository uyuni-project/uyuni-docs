= Hub Authentication Modes

Hub supports three different authentication modes:

* Manual mode (default): API credentials must be explicitly provided for each server.
* Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server.
You must provide a list of servers to connect to.
* Auto-connect mode: Credentials are reused for each server, and any server you have access to is automatically connected.



== Authentication Examples

This section provides examples of each authentication method.



.Example: Manual Authentication


In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each {productname} Server before you can connect to it.

A typical workflow for manual authentication is:

. Credentials for the Hub are passed to the ``login`` method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (``hubKey``).
. The server IDs are obtained using the session key, and all the peripheral servers are attached to the Hub using the ``hub.listServerIds`` method.
. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the ``attachToServers`` method.
This performs authentication against each server's XMLRPC API endpoint.
. A ``multicast`` call is performed on a set of servers.
This is defined by ``serverIds``, which contains the IDs of the servers to target.
In the background, ``system.list_system`` is called on each server's XMLRPC API
. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a ``map``.
The map has two entries:
+
* ``Successful``: list of responses for those clients where the call succeeded.
* ``Failed``: list of responses for those clients where the call failed.


[NOTE]
====
If you want to call a method on just one {productname} Server, then Hub API also provides a ``unicast`` namespace.
In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that {productname} server's API directly.

.Example Python Script for Manual Authentication:

----
#!/usr/bin/python
import xmlrpclib

HUB_URL = "http://localhost:8888/hub/rpc/api"
HUB_LOGIN = "admin"
HUB_PASSWORD = "admin"

client = xmlrpclib.Server(<HUB_URL>, verbose=0)

hubKey = client.hub.login(<HUB_LOGIN>, <HUB_PASSWORD>)

#Get the server IDs
serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubKey)

# authenticate those servers(each server with it's own credentials)
usernames = ["admin" for s in serverIds]
passwords = ["admin" for s in serverIds]
client.hub.attachToServers(hubKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords)

# perform the needed operation
systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubKey, serverIds)
successfulResponses = systemsPerServer["Successful"]["Responses"]
failedResponses = systemsPerServer["Failed"]["Responses"]

for system in successfulResponses:
  print (system)

#logout
client.auth.logout(hubKey)

.Example: Relay Authentication


In relay authentication mode, the credentials used sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with.
In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions.

After signing in, you must call the ``attachToServers`` method.
This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls.

A typical workflow for relay authentication is:

. Credentials for the Hub are passed to the ``login`` method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (``hubKey``).
. The server IDs are obtained using the session key, and all the peripheral servers are attached to the Hub using the ``hub.listServerIds`` method.
. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the ``attachToServers`` method.
This performs authentications against each server's XMLRPC API endpoint.
. Credentials for the Hub are passed to the ``loginWithAuthRelayMode`` method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (``hubKey``).
. The server IDs are obtained using the session key, and all the peripheral servers are attached to the Hub using the ``hub.listServerIds`` method.
. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the ``attachToServers`` method.
This performs authentication against each server's XMLRPC API endpoint.
. A ``multicast`` call is performed on a set of servers.
This is defined by ``serverIds``, which contains the IDs of the servers to target.
In the background, ``system.list_system`` is called on each server's XMLRPC API.
. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a ``map``.
The map has two entries:
+
* ``Successful``: list of responses for those clients where the call succeeded.
* ``Failed``: list of responses for those clients where the call failed.

HUB_LOGIN = "admin"
HUB_PASSWORD = "admin"

client = xmlrpclib.Server(<HUB_URL>, verbose=0)

hubKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(<HUB_LOGIN>, <HUB_PASSWORD>)

#Get the server IDs
serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubKey)

#authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate)
client.hub.attachToServers(hubKey, serverIds)

# perform the needed operation
systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubKey, serverIds)
successfulResponses = systemsPerServer["Successful"]["Responses"]
failedResponses = systemsPerServer["Failed"]["Responses"]

for system in successfulResponses:
  print (system)

#logout
client.auth.logout(hubKey)

.Example: Auto-Connect Authentication


Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers.
However, there is no need to use the ``attachToServers`` method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers.
This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub.


A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is:

. Credentials for the Hub are passed to the ``loginWithAutoconnectMode`` method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (``hubKey``).
. A ``multicast`` call is performed on a set of servers.
This is defined by ``serverIds``, which contains the IDs of the servers to target.
In the background, ``system.list_system`` is called on each server's XMLRPC API.
. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a ``map``.
The map has two entries:
+
* ``Successful``: list of responses for those clients where the call succeeded.
* ``Failed``: list of responses for those clients where the call failed.

HUB_LOGIN = "admin"
HUB_PASSWORD = "admin"

client = xmlrpclib.Server(<HUB_URL>, verbose=0)

hubKey = client.hub.loginWithAutoconnectMode(<HUB_LOGIN>, <HUB_PASSWORD>)

#Get the server IDs
serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubKey)

# perform the needed operation
systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubKey, serverIds)
successfulResponses = systemsPerServer["Successful"]["Responses"]
failedResponses = systemsPerServer["Failed"]["Responses"]

for system in successfulResponses:
  print (system)

#logout
client.auth.logout(hubKey)
