= Hub AuthenticationÂ Modes

Hub supports 3 different authentication modes.

[square]
* `Manual mode` (default): user needs to provide API credentials for each Server explicitly
* `Relay mode`: the same credentials used to authenticate against the Hub will be re-used to authenticate Servers. The list of Servers to connect to will still be provided by the user
* `Auto connect mode`: Hub credentials will be reused for Servers and any Server the user has access to will be automatically connected

[NOTE]
====
Example for each mode are provided under Examples section.
