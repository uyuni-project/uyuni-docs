= Hub Namespaces

Hub XMLRPC API operates in a similar way to the {productname} API.
For {productname} API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma.

The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server's XMLRPC APIs, with a few differences in parameter and return types.
Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the {productname} API.

Hub supports three different namespaces:

* The ``hub`` namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server.
It supports all the methods that are available on a {productname} Server XMLRPC API as well as Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints.
Hub-specific methods are primarily related to authentication.
* The ``unicast`` namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub.
It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server's XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly.
* The ``multicast`` namespace is used to target multiple servers registered in the hub.
It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a ``map``.


Some important considerations for hub namespaces:

* You can obtain ``hubKey`` using different authentication methods.
For more information, see xref:large-deployments:hub-auth.adoc[].
* Individual server IDs can be obtained using ``client.hub.listServerIds(hubKey)``.
* The ``unicast`` namespace assumes all methods receive ``hubKey`` and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API

client.unicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubKey, serverId, param1, param2)

* The ``multicast`` namespace assumes all methods receive ``hubKey``, a list of ServerIDs, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server API.
The return value is a map, with `Successful` and `Failed` entries.
