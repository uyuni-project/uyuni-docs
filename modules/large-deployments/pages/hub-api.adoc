systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api
----

Once it is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

For examples, see xref:large-deployments:hub-auth.adoc[].

Logs are saved in ``/var/log/hub/hub-xmlrpc-api.log``.
Logs are rotated weekly, or when the log file size reaches the specified limit.
By default, the log file size limit is 10{nbsp}MB.
