= Hub Installation

Install the package hub-xmlrpc-api, available from SUSE Manager 4.1 and Uyuni repos, either on the Hub itself or on a host that has access to all Servers' XMLRPC APIs.

Configuration of `hub-xmlrpc-api` is specified in a JSON file like the following:

----
{
   "type": "json",
    "hub": {
       "manager_api_url": "http://localhost/rpc/api"
   },
    "connect_timeout": 10,
    "read_write_timeout": 10,
   }
----

Replace localhost in http://localhost/rpc/api above with the Hub's FQDN if necessary.

Set the `HUB_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to point to the configuration file.
