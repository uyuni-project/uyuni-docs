= Hub Installation

Before you begin, you need to install the XMLRPC API package, and configure the Hub Server to use the API.



.Procedure: Installing and Configuring the XMLRPC API
. On the Hub Server, or on a host that has access to all servers' XMLRPC APIs, install the ``hub-xmlrpc-api`` package.
The package is available in the {productname} {productnumber} repositories.
. Verify if the configuration file available at  ``/etc/hub/hub-xmlrpc-api-config.json`` is pointing to the correct Hub instance and modify it as required.
. OPTIONAL: In the configuration file, check the settings for the timeout parameters ``connect_timeout`` and ``read_write_timeout``.
The values for these parameters are defined in seconds.
. Restart services to pick up the configuration changes.
