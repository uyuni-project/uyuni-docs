= Hub Requirements

To set up a Hub installation, you will require:

* One central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server.
* Two or more additional {productname} Servers, registered to the Hub as Salt clients.
This document refers to these as peripheral servers.
* Any number of clients registered to the peripheral servers.

You will need credentials to access the XMLRPC APIs on each server, including the Hub Server.
