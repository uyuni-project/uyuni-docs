= HubÂ Requirements

To set up a Hub installation, you will require:

* One central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server.
* Two or more additional {productname} Servers, registered to the Hub as Salt clients.
This document refers to these as peripheral servers.
Register peripheral servers to the Hub Server directly, do not use a proxy.
* Any number of clients registered to the peripheral servers.
* Ensure the Hub Server and all peripheral servers are running {productname}{nbsp}4.1 or higher.


[NOTE]
====
The Hub Server must not have clients registered to it.
Clients should only be registered to the peripheral servers.
====


You will need credentials to access the XMLRPC APIs on each server, including the Hub Server.
