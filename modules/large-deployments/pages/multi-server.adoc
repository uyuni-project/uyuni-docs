= Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deployments

Hub is an umbrella term. It is collection of number of components and improvement which could help
users with large setups to easily manage their systems. A general problem statement is given below which was the main motivation behind this effort.


===  Problem statement


====  Scalability
Some of our users need to manage large amounts of clients (tens of thousands). Currently, this is impossible to achieve using a single Server and there is no forecast of being able to accomplish that in the foreseeable future. We want to define a new {productname}-based solution to provide a reasonable subset of {productname} functionality at that scale.

====  Store independence
An additional specific problem arises in retail environments, where the need is to manage a very large number of clients in a large number of physical locations (stores). Stores should be able to use a reasonable subset of {productname} functionality locally even in temporary or prolonged absence of a connection to the Internet or a company intranet, in particular to a central data center.


===  Architecture

The typical architecture is represented below:
