{productname} is designed by default to work on small and medium scale installations.
For installations with more than 1000 clients per {productname} Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed.

There is no hard maximum number of supported systems.
Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation.
Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured.


[WARNING]
====
Large installations require standard Salt clients.
These instructions cannot be used in environments using traditional clients or Salt SSH minions.

There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments.
You can manage them with a single {productname} Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub.
Both methods are described in this book.

Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use {smr} to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals.
There is an introduction to {smr} in this book.

Tuning and monitoring large scale deployments can differ from smaller installations.
This book contains guidance for both tuning and monitoring within larger installations.
