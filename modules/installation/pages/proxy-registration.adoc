[[proxy-register]]
= SUSE Manager Proxy Registration

{productname} Proxy systems are registered as Salt or traditional clients using a bootstrap script.
Migrating a traditional proxy to a Salt proxy is not possible.

If you want to change a traditional proxy to a Salt proxy, you need to reinstall the proxy.
For more information about reinstalling proxies, see xref:installation:proxy-setup.adoc#replace-susemgrproxy[].


This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed {productname} Proxy with an activation key as a {productname} client.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When choosing a username or password for your {productname} Proxy, ensure it does not contain an ``@`` or ``:`` character.
These characters are reserved.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have completely downloaded the {productname} Proxy {productnumber} channel and all the recommended and mandatory {sle} {sles-version} {sp-version} channels.

// Atfer a successful sync run, bootstrap repos are now created automatically.
// Since 4.1 or earlier
// Creating tools repo for bootstrapping must happen before we tell the
// the user to lookup client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc
// where you also find a section about running the bootstrap script...
. Create the SUSE Manager Tools Repository for bootstrapping, see xref:client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc[].
////
. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy if needed.
    If you want to run the proxy on a traditional client (system type ``Management``) uncheck [guimenu]``Bootstrap using Salt``.
    Using Salt is the default.
// What's up with:
// Enable Remote Configuration
// Enable Remote Commands
    For more information about bootstrap scripts, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

.Modifying Bootstrap Script

. Bootstrap the client with the bootstrap script.
. For Salt clients, accept the key on the menu:Salt[Keys] page by checking the appropriate checkbox.
    When accepted, it will appear in the menu:Systems[Overview].
. Navigate to menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels], and check that the four proxy channels ([systemitem]``Pool`` and [systemitem]``Updates`` for [systemitem]``SLE-PRODUCT`` and [systemitem]``SLE-MODULE``) plus the recommended channels are selected.
    [systemitem]``SLE-PRODUCT-Pool`` must be the base channel and the others are child channels.
