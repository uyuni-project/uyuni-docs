This section details the networking and port requirements for {productname}.

Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)::
The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly or cookies will not work properly on the WebUI.
+
For more information about configuring the hostname and DNS, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/sec_basicnet_yast.html#sec_basicnet_yast_change_host[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation - Configuring Host Name and DNS]

Hostname and IP Address::
To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server.
+
For more information about setting up a DNS server, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_sle_admin/data/cha_dns.html[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation - The Domain Name System]

Using a Proxy When Installing from {sle} Media::
If you are on an internal network and do not have access to {scc}, you can set up and use a proxy during installation.
+
For more information about configuring a proxy for access to {scc} during a {sle} installation, see https://www.suse.com/documentation/sled-12/singlehtml/book_sle_deployment/book_sle_deployment.html#sec.i.yast2.start.parameters.proxy[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Documentation -  Using a Proxy During Installation]


.Naming Your Server
[IMPORTANT]
====
The hostname of {productname} must not contain uppercase letters as this may cause _jabberd_ to fail.
Choose the hostname of your {productname} server carefully.
Although changing the server name is possible, it is a complex process and unsupported.
====


In a production environment, {productname} server and its clients should always use a firewall.
This table gives an overview of required ports, to be used when you are setting up your firewall rules.
