= Network Requirements

This section details the networking and port requirements for {productname}.

Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)::
The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly.
If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause serious problems in a number of different components.
+
For more information about configuring the hostname and DNS, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-network.html#sec-network-yast-change-host.

Hostname and IP Address::
To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server.
You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured.
+
For more information about setting up a DNS server, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-dns.html.

Using a Proxy When Installing from {sle} Media::
If you are on an internal network and do not have access to {scc}, you can set up and use a proxy during installation.
+
For more information about configuring a proxy for access to {scc} during a {sle} installation, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-boot-parameters.html#sec-boot-parameters-advanced-proxy.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The hostname of {productname} must not contain uppercase letters as this may cause _jabberd_ to fail.
Choose the hostname of your {productname} server carefully.
Although changing the server name is possible and supported, it is important to plan for this change before going ahead with it.
When you change the hostname of the server, all clients attached to the server must be made aware of the change.
====


In a production environment, the {productname} Server and clients should always use a firewall.
