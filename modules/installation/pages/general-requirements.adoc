[[installation-general-supportedbrowsers]]
== Supported Browsers for the {susemgr} {webui}

In order to use the {webui} to manage your {susemgr} environment, you will need to ensure you are running an up to date web browser.

{susemgr} is supported on:

* Latest Firefox browser shipped with SLES
* Latest Chrome browser on all operating systems
* Latest Edge browser shipped with Windows

Windows Internet Explorer is not supported.
The {productname} {webui} will not render correctly under Windows Internet Explorer.



== Partition Permissions

When you create disk partitions for the {productname} Server and Proxy, ensure you set the permissions correctly.

For [path]``/var/lib/pgsql``:

* Owner: Read, Write, Execute
* Group: Read, Execute
* User: None

For [path]``/var/spacewalk``:

* Owner: Read, Write, Execute
* Group: Read, Write, Execute
* User: Read, Execute

Check the permissions with this command:

----
ls -l /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk
----

The output should look like this:

----
drwxr-x--- 1 postgres postgres /var/lib/pgsql
drwxrwxr-x 1 wwwrun   www      /var/spacewalk
----

If required, change the permissions with these commands:

----
chmod 750 /var/lib/pgsql
chmod 775 /var/spacewalk
----

And owners with:

----
chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql
chown wwwrun:www /var/spacewalk
----
