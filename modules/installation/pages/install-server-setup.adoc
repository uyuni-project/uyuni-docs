* Create the main administration account with the {productname} {webui}
* Name your base organization and add login credentials
* Sync the {sle} product channel from {scc}

== {productname} Setup

[WARNING]
.Third Party Software
--
{productname} is an extension of {sls} and compatible with the software shipped with {sls}.

{productname} is a complex system, and therefore installing third party is not allowed. Installing monitoring software provided by a third party vendor is allowed only if you do not exchange basic libraries such as SSL, cryptographic software, and similar tools.
In case of emergency, SUSE reserves the right to ask to remove any third party software (and associated configuration changes) and then to reproduce the problem on a clean system.
--

This section will guide you through {productname} setup procedures.

.Procedure: {productname} Setup
. Login to the {productname} server desktop and perform one of the following actions to begin setup:

* Select menu:Applications[System Tools > YaST > SUSE Manager Setup].
* Open a terminal as root and type [command]``yast2 susemanager_setup`` to begin setup.

. From the introduction screen select menu:SUSE Manager Setup[Setup SUSE Manager from scratch] and click btn:[Next] to continue.

. Enter an email address to receive status notifications and click btn:[Next] to continue.
Note that {productname} can sometimes send a large volume of notification emails.
You can disable email notifications in the {webui} after setup, if you need to.
+

. Enter your certificate information and a password.
Passwords must be at at least seven characters in length, and must not contain spaces, single or double quotation marks (``'`` or ``"``), exclamation marks (``!``), or dollar signs (``$``).
Always store your passwords in a secure location.
+

[IMPORTANT]
.Certificate Password
====
Without this password it will not be possible to set up a {productname} Proxy Server.
====
+

. Click btn:[Next] to continue.

. From the menu:SUSE Manager Setup[Database Settings] screen, enter a database user and password and click btn:[Next] to continue.
Passwords must be at at least seven characters in length, and must not contain spaces, single or double quotation marks (``'`` or ``"``), exclamation marks (``!``), or dollar signs (``$``).
Always store your passwords in a secure location.

//UPDATE devs added a skip button as scc is unnecessary for custom setups.
. Enter your {scc} [systemitem]``Organization Credentials``.
Open https://scc.suse.com/login to register or access to your organization credentials.
+

[NOTE]
.btn:[Skip]
====
If you are using SUSE Enterprise products, {productname} requires that you connect to {scc} for software, updates and patches.
You will not be able to synchronize or provide Enterprise channels to your clients without this information.

However if you would like to work with open source software channels and repositories then click the btn:[Skip] button to continue.
You can setup your {scc} credentials or configure inter-server sync at a later time.
====

. Click btn:[Next] to continue.

. Click btn:[Yes] to run setup when prompted.

. Once setup has completed, click btn:[Next] to continue.
You will see the address of the {productname} {webui}.
+

. Click btn:[Finish] to complete {productname} setup.

In the next section you will create the administrator's account and synchronize with {scc}.

[[suma.setup.with.yast.admin]]
=== Creating the Main Administration Account

This section will walk you through creating your organizations main administration account for {productname}.

[WARNING]
.Admin and User Accounts
====
The main administration account is the _highest authority account_ within {productname} and therefore account access information should be stored in a secure location.

For security it is recommended that the main administrator creates _low level admin accounts_ designated for administration of organizations and individual groups.
====

[[suma.setup.admin.account]]
.Procedure: Setup the Main Administration Account
. In the browser, enter the address provided after completing setup and open the {productname} {webui}.

. Add your organization name to the menu:Create Organization[Organization Name] field.

. Add your username and password to the menu:Create Organization[Desired Login] and menu:Create Organization[Desired Password] fields.

. Fill in the Account Information fields including an email for system notifications.

. Select menu:Create Organization[] to finish creating your administration account.

You should now be presented with the {productname} Front Page. In the next section you will prepare the server for connecting the first client.

[[quickstart.first.channel.sync]]
=== Syncing Products from {scc}

{scc} (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release and architecture.
After synchronizing with SCC clients may receive updates, and be organized into groups and assigned to specific product software channels.

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. From the {productname} {webui} start page select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].

. From the menu:Main Menu[Admin > Setup Wizard] page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
Wait a moment for the products list to populate.
If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
This table lists architecture, channels, and status information.
For more information, see:

pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#vle.webui.admin.wizard.products[]]
+

image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+

. Since Your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.

* Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Start product synchronization by clicking the btn:[Add Products] button.

After adding the channel {productname} will schedule the channel to be copied.
This can take a long time as {productname} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scc} to local [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory of your server.


[TIP]
.PostgreSQL and Transparant Huge Pages
====
In some environments, _Transparent Huge Pages_ provided by the kernel may slow down PostgreSQL workloads significantly.

To disable _Transparant Huge Pages_ set the [option]``transparent_hugepage`` kernel parameter to [option]``never``.
This has to be changed in [path]``/etc/default/grub`` and added to the line [option]``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT``, for example:

----
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts elevator=noop transparent_hugepage=never"
----

To write the new configuration run [command]``grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg``.
To update the grub2 during boot run [command]``grub2-install /dev/sda``.
====

Monitor channel synchronization process in real-time by viewing channel log files located in the directory [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync``:

----
tailf /var/log/rhn/reposync/<CHANNEL_NAME>.log
----

After the channel sync process has completed proceed to:

 pass:c[xref:FILENAME.adoc#preparing.and.registering.clients[]]
