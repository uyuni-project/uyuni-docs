== Set up {productname} with {yast}

This section will guide you through {productname} setup procedures.

.Procedure: {productname} Setup
. Log in to the {productname} Server and start {yast}.

== Create the Main Administration Account

This section covers how to create your organization's main administration account for {productname}.

[WARNING]
====
The main administration account has the highest authority within {productname}.
Ensure you keep access information for this account secure.

We recommend that you create lower level administration accounts for organizations and groups.
Do not share the main administration access details.
====

[NOTE]
====
Newer browser versions can block web access to the {productname} Server FQDN because of HSTS.

Installing the CA certificate from the [path]``pub`` directory via HTTP and importing it to the browser will allow access to the server.

. On the server, go to http://<server>.example.com/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT.

. Import the certificate file.
  In the browser settings (for Firefox), open menu:Privacy & Security[Certificates > View Certificates], and import the file.
====

.Procedure: Setting Up the Main Administration Account

. In your web browser, enter the address for the {productname} {webui}.
    This address was provided after you completed setup.
    For more information, see xref:uyuni-server-setup.adoc#server-setup-yast[].

. Log in to the {webui}, navigate to the menu:Create Organization[Organization Name] field, and enter your organization name.

. In the menu:Create Organization[Desired Login] and menu:Create Organization[Desired Password] fields, enter your username and password.

. Fill in the Account Information fields including an email for system notifications.

. Click btn:[Create Organization] to finish creating your administration account.

When you have completed the {productname} {webui} setup, you are taken to the menu:Home[Overview] page.
// In the next section you will prepare the server for connecting the first client.


== Optional: Synchronizing Products from {scc}

{scc} (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture.
After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels.

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[NOTE]
====
For Uyuni, synchronizing products from {scc} is optional.
====

Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in {productname}.
The organization credentials give you access to the {suse} product downloads.
You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations.

Enter your organization credentials in the {productname} {webui}:


[[proc-admin-organization-credentials]]
.Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. In the {susemgr} {webui}, navigate to menu:Main Menu[Admin > Setup Wizard].
. In the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page, navigate to the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. Enter a username and password, and click btn:[Save].

A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed.
When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with {scc}.


[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].

. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
    Wait a moment for the products list to populate.
    If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
    This table lists architecture, channels, and status information.
    For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].
+

image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. If your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.
+

* Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
    Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Click btn:[Add Products] to start product synchronization.

After adding the channel, {productname} will schedule the channel to be synchronized.
This can take a long time as {productname} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scc} to local [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory of your server.


[NOTE]
====
In some environments, transparent huge pages provided by the kernel can slow down PostgreSQL workloads significantly.

To disable transparent huge pages, set the [parameter]``transparent_hugepage`` kernel parameter to ``never``.
You will also need to open the [path]``/etc/default/grub`` file and add or edit the line [option]``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT``.
For example:

----
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts elevator=noop transparent_hugepage=never"
----

To write the new configuration run [command]``grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg``.
====

Monitor the channel synchronization process in real-time by viewing channel log files located in the directory [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync``:

----
tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<CHANNEL_NAME>.log
----

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can continue with client registration.
For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
