= Proxy Registration

Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script.

This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as a {productname} client.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the {productname} Proxy channel.

.Procedure: Registering the Proxy

. First create openSUSE Leap and the {productname} Proxy channels with the [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` command.
[command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is part of the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels \
opensuse_leap15_1 \
opensuse_leap15_1-non-oss \
opensuse_leap15_1-non-oss-updates \
opensuse_leap15_1-updates \
opensuse_leap15_1-uyuni-client \
uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-151
----
+
Instead of [systemitem]``uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-151`` you can also try [systemitem]``uyuni-proxy-devel-leap`` that is the current development version.
+
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[].

. Create the openSUSE LeapÂ 15 Uyuni Client Tools Repository for bootstrapping. For more information about bootstrapping, see xref:client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc[].
. Create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the other channels as child channels.
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy.
* Add the GPG key to the [systemitem]``ORG_GPG_KEY=`` parameter.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[].
* OPTIONAL: If you want to run the proxy on a traditional client (system type ``Management``) uncheck [guimenu]``Bootstrap using Salt``.
Using Salt is the default.
For more information about bootstrap scripts, see
xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
. Bootstrap the client using the script.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
. For Salt clients, navigate to menu:Salt[Keys] and accept the key.
When the key is accepted, it will show in menu:Systems[Overview].
. Navigate to menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels], and check that your proxy channel is selected.
For setting up a registered {productname} Proxy, see
xref:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc[].
