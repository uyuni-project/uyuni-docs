= Install {productname} Proxy from packages

To install {productname} Proxy, you will need to start by installing {sles} media.
This section covers the KVM settings required to perform a {sles} installation as the base for {productname} Proxy.
In this section, we use a KVM and a virtual machine manager as a sandbox for the installation.

== SLES KVM Requirements

Use these settings to create a new virtual machine with [command]``virt-manager`` (replace [literal]``<version>`` with the actual version string):

[[installation-proxy-sles-settings]]
=== SLES KVM Settings

This section covers the {productname} Proxy installation, using the full installation media with KVM and [command]``virt-manager``.
Before you begin, you will need to have created an account with {scc}, and downloaded the {sles} installation media.



.Procedure: Preparing for SLES Installation
. In the Virtual Machine Manager tool ([command]``virt-manager``), click menu:File[New Virtual Machine].

. Click btn:[Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)].

. In the [guimenu]``Create a new virtual machine`` dialog, click btn:[Browse] and locate the full SLES image you downloaded from your SCC account.

. Configure your machine with at least 2 GB RAM and a minimum of 2 CPUs.

. Create a storage device with a minimum of 230 GB storage space for the installation.
During the partitioning setup of the SLES installation this disk should be partitioned into the following disks:
+
// FIXME: not sure about swap space
// |4{nbsp}GB Swap space
+
[cols="1", options="header"]
|===
| Disk Space Requirements
| 100{nbsp}GB XFS partition (or dedicated virtual disk) for [path]``/srv/``
| 100{nbsp}GB XFS partition (or dedicated virtual disk) for [path]``/var/cache/``
|===
+
The remaining storage space will be used by the operating system for the root partition.

. Click btn:[Finish] to save the installation settings and begin the installation.

== Change SLES for SUSE Manager Proxy



[[proc-installation-proxy-sles]]
.Procedure: Changing SLES for {productname} Proxy Installation

// Most steps are currently needed because of 4.0 workarounds
. Log in as `root`.

. Uninstall the `sles-release` package:
+

----
rpm -e --nodeps sles-release
----

. Register {productname} Proxy with SCC (for example, replace `<productversion>` with `{productnumber}` and `<architecture>` with `x86_64`):
+

----
SUSEConnect -e<EMAIL_ADDRESS> -r<SUSE_MANAGER_PROXY_CODE> \
  -p SUSE-Manager-Proxy/<productversion>/<architecture>
----

. Add {productname} repositories:
+

----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-basesystem/15.1/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-server-applications/15.1/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-suse-manager-proxy/4.0/x86_64
----

. Check that you have allowed installing recommended packages.
Check the settings in `/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`:
+
----
solver.onlyRequires = false
----

. Install the {productname} Proxy pattern:
+

----
zypper in -t pattern suma_proxy
----

. Reboot.

Continue with registering the installed {productname} Proxy as a {productname} client: xref:proxy-registration.adoc[].
