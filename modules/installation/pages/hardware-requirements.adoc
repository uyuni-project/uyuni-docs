{productname} Server stores packages in the [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory. 
Repository synchronization fails if this directory runs out of disk space. 
You can estimate how much space the [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory requires based on the number and type of clients and repositories you plan to mirror.

{productname} Proxy caches packages in the [path]``/var/cache/`` directory.
If there is not enough space available in [path]``/var/cache/``, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages.

As a result of this behavior:

* The larger [path]``/var/cache/`` directory is on the {productname} Proxy, the less traffic there will be between it and the {productname} Server. 
* By making the [path]``/var/cache/`` directory on the {productname} Proxy the same size as [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` in the {productname} Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization.
* The [path]``/var/cache/`` directory can be small on the {productname} Server compared to {productname} Proxy. See estimation hints in the Server Hardware Requirements section.
