= Deploy Terminals - Other Methods


If you are not able to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device.
You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing.
For more information, see xref:retail:retail-deploy-terminals.adoc[].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you have registered new terminals, always check the {productname} {webui} to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the {productname} Server by mistake.
====



== Deploy Terminals with a Removable USB Device

If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device.
This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local {productname} {smr} branch server providing network services.

You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote {productname} {smr} branch server.
You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the {productname} {smr} Server.

[NOTE]
====
POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the {productname} {smr} branch server that created the USB device.
====



.Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device
. On the {productname} {smr} branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image.
+
You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes.
+
Ensure you allow at least 300{nbsp}MB:
+
----
salt-call image_sync_usb.create <usb image name> <size in MB>
----
. Insert the USB device into the {productname} {smr} branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location:
+
----
dd bs=1M if=<usb image name> of=<path to usb device>
----


When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting.
You can check this by editing the {saltboot} formula in the {productname} {smr} {webui}.
For more information about the {saltboot} formula, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-saltboot.adoc[].



.Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB
. Insert the USB device into the terminal.
. Power on the POS terminal.
. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping.



== Deploy Terminals over a Wireless Network

For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network.
Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device.

For more information about using USB devices to boot, see xref:retail:retail-deploy-terminals-other.adoc[].


[WARNING]
====
Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images.
The boot ``initrd`` image and the partition that contains ``/etc/salt`` must be stored unencrypted on the terminal.
This allows {productname} {smr} to set up the wireless network.
If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted.
====


Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device.
Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the ``dracut-wireless`` package included.
For more information about using USB devices to boot, see xref:retail:retail-deploy-terminals-other.adoc[].

When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal.
You can do this in a number of ways:

* Directly during image build.
* Add it to the ``initrd`` file on the branch server.
* During terminal booting, using the kernel command line.


.Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build
. Ensure that the ``dracut-wireless`` package is included  in the image template.
. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the ``etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0`` file to the image template, with these details:
+
----
# ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD
WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name>
WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password>
----
If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ``ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD`` line.
. Build the image.
. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal.
    For more information about using USB devices to boot, see xref:retail:retail-deploy-terminals-other.adoc[].



.Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd
. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the ``etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0`` file, with these details:
+
----
# ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD
WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name>
WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password>
----
. . Copy the file to ``initrd`` on the branch server:
+
----
echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz
----
. Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting.
  You can check this by editing the {saltboot} formula in the {productname} {smr} {webui}.
  For more information about the {saltboot} formula, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-saltboot.adoc[].



.Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot
. Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it.
. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters:
+
----
WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name>
WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password>
----



=== Change Wireless Credentials

After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed.
The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network.



.Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network
. Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials.
. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image.
. Boot terminal from new USB device.



.Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks
. In the [path]``/srv/salt/`` directory, create a salt state called ``update-terminal-credentials.sls``, and enter the new wireless network credentials:
+
----
/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0
  file.managed:
   - contents: |
        WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name>
        WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password>
# regenerate initrd
  cmd.run:
  - name: 'mkinitrd'
----
. Apply the Salt state to the terminal:
+
----
salt <terminal_salt_name> state.apply update-terminal-credentials
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to [path]``/etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0``.
====



=== Use Multiple Wireless Networks

You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation.

If you provide wireless credentials using ``initrd`` files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called ``initrd-ifcfg-wlan0``, and the other for use during normal operation, called ``ifcfg-wlan0``.

Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with ``saltboot-hook``.

First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation.
This will become the default settings.
Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure.


.Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network
. Write a custom Salt state named ``/srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls`` containing the wireless details for normal operation.
    This Salt state is applied by {saltboot} after the system image is deployed.
+
----
{% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %}
{{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0:
  file.managed:
   - contents: |
        WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name>
        WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password>
    - require:
      - saltboot: saltboot_fstab
    - require_in:
      - saltboot: boot_system
----


[NOTE]
====
The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration.
Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.
