== Deploying new images

This file describes how to deploy a new image on selected terminals first, test it, and then deploy it to all terminals.

The hardware type group (i.e. [literal]``HWTYPE`` group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the {saltboot} formula. 
This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. 

.Procedure: Dual group image deployment

. Build new image.
    Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers.
. Create a test group.
  * Name the group, for example, [literal]``TEST:POSVendor-Terminal``. The name can be chosen freely.
  * Add the {saltboot} formula to this group. 
    Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group ([literal]``HWTYPE``), except for the image version. 
    Use the name and version of the new image.
. Move selected terminals.
  * Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on.
  * Transfer these terminals from the group [literal]``HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal`` group to the newly created group [literal]``TEST:POSVendor-Terminal``. 
    It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task.
. Reboot terminals.
  * Power on the selected POS terminals. 
    They should boot the new image.
. Verify and evaluate.
  * Monitor the terminals in the [literal]``TEST:POSVendor-Terminal`` group.
  * Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered.
. Update [literal]``HWTYPE`` group.
  * Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the [literal]``HWTYPE`` group can be updated.
  * Modify the image version in the [literal]``HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal`` group to match the tested and approved version.
  * This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image.


=== Controlling image versions

By default, {saltboot} formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified.

There are multiple methods to control the image version within the [literal]``HWTYPE`` and [literal]``TEST`` groups:

//.Procedure: Image control
* Specify exact version.
** In both the [literal]``HWTYPE`` and [literal]``TEST`` groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed.
** Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized.
* Mark new image as [literal]``Inactive``.
** In the [literal]``HWTYPE`` group, do not specify the image version.
** Mark the new image as [literal]``Inactive`` after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server.
** The [literal]``Inactive`` flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified.
** After testing, remove the [literal]``Inactive`` flag so the image can be auto-selected in the [literal]``HWTYPE`` group.
** The [literal]``Inactive`` flag can be accessed through the API.
   For more information, see xref:retail:retail-image-pillars.adoc[].
* Utilize [literal]``Freeze Image`` flag.
** In the [literal]``HWTYPE`` group, omit the image version.
** Before synchronizing the new image, set the [literal]``Freeze Image`` flag in {saltboot} formula in [literal]``HWTYPE`` group. 
   This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image.
** Synchronize and test the new image in the [literal]``TEST`` group.
** Reset the [literal]``Freeze Image`` flag in [literal]``HWTYPE`` group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too.

[WARNING]
====
Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. 
It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.
