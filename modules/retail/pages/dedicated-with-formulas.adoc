= Set Up the {productname} {smr} Environment with dedicated network for terminal

To set up the {productname} {smr} environment, you will need to have already installed and configured:

* {productname} {smr} Server
* one or more {productname} {smr} branch server containerized proxies
* one additional salt client for network management
* one or more POS images built


== Assumptions

In this example we consider architecture with dedicated network for POS terminals where branch server provides retail services TFTP, PXE, HTTP and required network services DHCP and DNS is provided by additional salt client host.

For dedicated network we assume 192.168.86.0/24 network and [systemitem]``eth1`` as network interface.

We assume to have one containerized branch server running on registered containerized host with salt minion id [systemitem]``branch1.mystore.com``, which is equal to the branch server fully qualified domain name, and branch id [systemitem]``B0001``.

As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer [systemitem]``TerminalOEM`` and model [systemitem]``T1000``.

For POS image we assume to have one with name [systemitem]``POS_Image_JeOS7``.


== Create required system groups

Unlike when using provided tools, manually setting up formulas requires manual creation of needed system groups.
Follow guide xref:reference:systems/system-groups.adoc[] to create the system groups:

- [systemitem]``TERMINALS``
- [systemitem]``HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000``
- [systemitem]``B0001``

First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group.

For more information about {saltboot} groups, see xref:retail:retail-install-setup.adoc[].

== Configure dedicated network on container host

If dedicated network is not yet set up on the container host, use following command to create new network with static IP address.

```
nmcli connection add con-name "Terminal Network" \
  ipv4.addresses 192.168.86.1                    \
  ipv4.gateway 192.168.86.1                      \
  ipv4.dns 192.168.86.1                          \
  ipv4.dns-search branch1.mystore.com            \
  ipv4.method auto                               \
  ifname eth1 type ethernet
```


== Assign and configure branch server formulas

We assign following formulas to the branch server:

- Dhcpd
- Bind

.Procedure: Assign formulas to the branch server

[IMPORTANT]
====
[systemitem]``Saltboot Group`` is a group formula to be assigned to the branch group.

Assigning [systemitem]``Saltboot Group`` to the branch server directly will not have any effect.
