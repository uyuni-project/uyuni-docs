= Terminal Names

Terminals can be named according to certain parameters, which can make it easier to match the physical device with its record in the {productname} {webui}.

Naming schemes available are ``Hostname``, ``FQDN``, ``HWType``, and ``MAC``.
Naming scheme can be selected in the [guimenu]``Branch Network`` formula.
For more information, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].

By default, terminals are named according to the ``Hostname`` naming scheme with the ``HWType`` scheme as a fallback.



== Naming by ``HWType``

Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format:

----
BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID
----

For example:

----
B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643
----


The [systemitem]``BranchID`` is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to.
You can configure this value in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[] settings for the branch server.
You can disable this prefix by toggling the [systemitem]``Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID`` checkbox in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].

The [systemitem]``Manufacturer``, [systemitem]``ProductName``, and [systemitem]``SerialNumber`` are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS.
If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name.

The [systemitem]``UniqueID`` is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number.
Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment.
Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail.



== Naming by ``Hostname``

Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format:

----
BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID
----

For example:

----
B002.terminal-c643
----


The [systemitem]``BranchID`` is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to.
You can configure this value in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[] settings for the branch server.
You can disable this prefix by toggling the [systemitem]``Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID`` checkbox in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].

The [systemitem]``Hostname`` is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal.

The [systemitem]``UniqueID`` is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number.
You can disable this behavior by toggling the [systemitem]``Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID`` checkbox in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].



== Naming by ``FQDN``

Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format:

----
BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID
----

For example:

----
B002.terminal.example.com-c643
----


The [systemitem]``BranchID`` is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to.
You can configure this value in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[] settings for the branch server.
You can disable this prefix by toggling the [systemitem]``Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID`` checkbox in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].

The [systemitem]``FQDN`` is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal.

The [systemitem]``UniqueID`` is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number.
You can disable this behavior by toggling the [systemitem]``Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID`` checkbox in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].

== Naming by ``MAC``

Terminal names are derived from the network interface hardware address (MAC) and use this format:

----
BranchID.MAC-UniqueID
----

For example:

----
B0002.52:54:00:62:18:6f-cb83
----

The [systemitem]``BranchID`` is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to.
You can configure this value in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[] settings for the branch server.
You can disable this prefix by toggling the [systemitem]``Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID`` checkbox in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].

The [systemitem]``MAC`` is colon delimited hardware address of the network interface card used for booting of the terminal.

The [systemitem]``UniqueID`` is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number.
You can disable this behavior by toggling the [systemitem]``Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID`` checkbox in the xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-branchnetwork.adoc[].

== Assign Hostnames to Terminals


If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname.
This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname.

There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals.
This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the branch server.


.Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas

. In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to [guimenu]``Hosts with Static IP Address`` and click btn:[Add Item].
  For more information on the DHCP formula, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-dhcpd.adoc[].
. In the [guimenu]``Hostname`` field, type the hostname of the branch server.
. In the [guimenu]``IP Address`` field, type the static IP address for the terminal.
  Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server.
. In the [guimenu]``Hardware Type and Address`` field, type the hardware type and address in this format:
+
----
ethernet <terminal_MAC_address>
----
. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click btn:[Add Item] and fill in the details for each terminal.
. Click btn:[Save Formula] to save the changes.
. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click btn:[Add Item].
  For more information on the bind formula, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-bind.adoc[].
. In the [guimenu]``Hostname`` field, type the hostname of the branch server.
. In the [guimenu]``IP Address`` field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings.
. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click btn:[Add Item] and fill in the details for each terminal.
. Click btn:[Save Formula] to save the changes.
. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration.
When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name.
====



.Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML

. At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file:
+
----
retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml
----
. Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section.
  Add a new [systemitem]``terminals`` section if it does not already exist.
. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format:
+
----
$hostname:
        IP: <IP_Address>
        hwAddress: <MAC_Address>
        hwtype: <HWTYPE_Group_name_without_HWTYPE:_prefix>
----
. Import the modified YAML file:
+
----
retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml
----
. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration.
When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name.
