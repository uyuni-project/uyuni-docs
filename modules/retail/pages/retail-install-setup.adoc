= Setting up

To set up an {smr} environment, you will need to have already installed and configured {susemgr} Server, have one or more {smr} branch server, and one or more {susemgr} build host.

This section covers how to configure your {smr} environment, including:
* Prepare POS images
* Configure services on the branch server
* Synchronize POS images to the branch servers

The very first time you set up an {smr} environment, you will need to perform all three steps.
You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with {smr}.

For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization.
If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers.

If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches.
You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server.

Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens.

== Prepare and Build Terminal Images

For information about {susemgr} image building, see xref:administration:image-management.adoc[].

{smr} POS images are images specifically tailored for {smr} environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism.

=== POS Image Templates

As starting point, {suse} provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage[].
These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, POS templates do not include a system user.
You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a {suse} provided template.
However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user.
You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed.
====

=== SLES{nbsp}11 SP{nbsp}3 Terminals

POS Terminals based on {sles}{nbsp}11 SP{nbsp}3 can be deployed in much the same way as other terminals, with a few differences.

* You must use the SLES{nbsp}11 template
* SLES{nbsp}11 images need to be activated with the [systemitem]``SLES11 SP3 i586`` and [systemitem]``SLEPOS 11 SP3 i586`` channels

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that SLES{nbsp}11 images are built on the SLES{nbsp}11 build host.
Building on the incorrect build host will cause your build to fail.
====

[WARNING]
====
If you are building images for SLES{nbsp}11 using profiles from an HTTPS git repository that uses TLS 1.0 or greater, it will fail.
SLES{nbsp}11 does not support later versions of TLS.
You will need to clone the repository locally in order to use it for building.
====

== Configure Services on the Branch Server

Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology, and know the minion ID of the branch server.
For the information about the possible network topologies, see xref:retail:retail-network-arch.adoc[].

Configure branch server services from the {susemgr} Server.
The configuration is then applied to the selected branch server using Salt states.
{susemgr} Formulas with Forms functionality is used to configure branch server services, however there are multiple ways to configure them:

* {smr} provided command line tool [command]``retail_branch_init``
* {smr} provided mass import command line tool [command]``retail_yaml``
* {susemgr} web UI and configuring formulas manually (for advanced users)


The branch server can be configured automatically using the [command]``retail_branch_init`` command, as shown in this section.
If you prefer to manually configure the branch server, you can do so using formulas.
For more information about formulas, see xref:retail:retail-formulas-intro.adoc[].

.Procedure: Configuring Branch Server Formulas With a Helper Script

. Branch server configuration is performed using the [command]``retail_branch_init`` command:
+
----
retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id>
----
+
This command will configure branch server formulas with default values and for shared networking topology.
For dedicated network topology run this command:
+
----
retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id> --dedicated-nic <network_device>
----
+
You can customize network information as well, together with custom [systemitem]``branch prefix``. For example:
+
----
retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id> --dedicated-nic eth1
                                             --branch-prefix B001
                                             --server-domain <branch_server_subdomain>
                                             --branch-ip 192.168.86.1
                                             --netmask 255.255.255.0
----
+
You can use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command for additional options.

. Verify that your changes have been configured correctly by checking the {susemgr} {webui} branch server system formulas.
. Apply highstate on the branch server.
You can do this through the {webui}, or by running this command:
+
----
salt <branch_server_minion_id> state.apply
----

Similar results can be achieved by using mass import command line tool.

.Procedure: Configuring Branch Server Formulas With a Mass Import Tool

. Prepare branch specific YAML file:
+
For example, create branch.yaml file with content:
+
----
branches:
  <branch_server_minion_id>:
    branch_prefix: branch1
    server_name: branchserver1
    server_domain: example.com
    nic: eth1
    dedicated_nic: true
    configure_firewall: true
    branch_ip: 192.168.2.1
    netmask: 255.255.255.0
    dyn_range:
        - 192.168.2.10
        - 192.168.2.250
----
+
For more information about mass import tool, see xref:retail:retail-mass-config.adoc[].
. Import branch information from YAML file to {susemgr}
+
----
retail_yaml --from-yaml branch.yaml
----
. Verify that your changes have been configured correctly by checking the {susemgr} {webui} branch server system formulas.
. Apply highstate on the branch server.

[WARNING]
====
Both [command]``retail_branch_init`` and [command]``retail_yaml`` commands override existing configuration settings of the specified branch server.
====

After the initial configuration done by command line tools, branch server configuration can be further adjusted in {susemgr} {webui} through branch server formulas.

=== Required System Groups

{smr} requires system groups for terminals and servers.
Manually create these system groups during installation:

* [systemitem]``TERMINALS``
* [systemitem]``SERVERS``

Additionally, you will need to create a system group for each branch server, and each terminal hardware type in your environment.
For more information about hardware type groups, see xref:retail:retail-deploy-terminals.adoc[].

Branch server groups are named after branch server prefixes, for example group name [systemitem]``B0001`` for branch server prefix [systemitem]``BOO1``.

You can create system groups using the {susemgr} {webui}.
Navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and click btn:[Create System Group].

For more information about system groups, see xref:reference:systems/system-groups.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
{smr} command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically.
====


== Synchronize Images to the Branch Server

The OS image you use on the {susemgr} server must be synchronized for use to the branch server.
You can do this with the Salt [command]``image-sync`` state, part of the [systemitem]``Image Synchronization Formula``.

.Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server

. On the {susemgr} server, run this command:
+
----
salt <branch_server_minion_id> state.apply image-sync
----
. The image details will be transferred to [path]``/srv/saltboot`` on the branch server.

You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server.
Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly.
For more information about [systemitem]``Image Synchronization Formula``, see xref:salt:formula-imagesync.adoc[].
