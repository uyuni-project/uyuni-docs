= Deploy Terminals and Auto-Accept Keys

You can configure {productname} to automatically accept the keys of newly deployed terminals.
This is achieved using Salt grains.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys.
Only use this method on trusted networks.
====

There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains:

* Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them.
  To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing ``initrd``.
* Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client.
  To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built.
  After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain.
* Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters.

When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the {productname} Server to accept them.



.Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once
. On the branch server, create a configuration file called [path]``/etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf``.
. Edit the new configuration file with these details.
  You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key:
+
----
# create the grain
grains:
    autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY>

# send the grain as part of auth request
autosign_grains:
    - autosign_key
----
. At the command prompt, add the new configuration file to the existing ``initrd``:
+
----
echo ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf | /
cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz
----



.Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains
. In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called [path]``etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf``.
. Edit the new configuration file with these details.
  You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key:
+
----
# create the grain
grains:
    autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY>

# send the grain as part of auth request
autosign_grains:
    - autosign_key
----



.Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot
. Configure the PXE formula to specify these kernel parameters during booting:
+
----
SALT_AUTOSIGN_GRAINS=autosign_key:<AUTOSIGN_KEY>
----
. PXE boot the Salt client.
  The formula creates the [path]``./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf`` configuration file and passes it to ``initrd``.


When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them.
The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the [path]``/etc/salt/master.d/`` directory.
You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot.



.Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept
. On the {productname} Server, open the master configuration file in the [path]``/etc/salt/master.d/`` directory, and add or edit this line:
+
----
autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains
----
. Create a file at [path]``/etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key``, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot:
+
----
<AUTOSIGN_KEY>
----
  For multiple keys, put each one on a new line.
