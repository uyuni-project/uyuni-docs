== Create the Main Administration Account

This section covers how to create your organization's main administration account for {productname}.

[WARNING]
====
The main administration account has the highest authority within {productname}.
Ensure you keep access information for this account secure.
We recommend that you create lower level administration accounts for organizations and groups.
Do not share the main administration access details.
====


.Procedure: Setting Up the Main Administration Account

. In your web browser, enter the address for the {productname} {webui}.
  This address was provided after you completed setup.
  For more information, see xref:retail:retail-uyuni-server-setup.adoc#retail-server-setup-yast[].

. Sign in to the {webui}, navigate to the menu:Create Organization[Organization Name] field, and enter your organization name.

. In the menu:Create Organization[Desired Login] and menu:Create Organization[Desired Password] fields, enter your username and password.

. Complete the ``Account Information`` fields, including an email for system notifications.

. Click btn:[Create Organization] to finish creating your administration account.

When you have completed the {productname} {webui} setup, you are taken to the menu:Home[Overview] page.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {productname} branch servers and terminals to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {opensuse} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[opensuse-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.OpenSUSE Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Updates Channel
| Other Channels

| {opensuse} Leap {opensuse-version}
| opensuse_leap15_2
| opensuse_leap15_2-uyuni-client
| opensuse_leap15_2-updates
| uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-152

|===

include::snippets/add_channels_cli.adoc[]



== Check Synchronization Status

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_uyuni.adoc[]

include::snippets/check_sync_cli.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
{opensuse} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====



== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

include::snippets/trust_gpg.adoc[]



// FIXME Starting from here, everything is preliminary
// Feedback provided by Lukas
== Create Activation Key for a Branch Server and the Retail Terminals

The branch server is based on an {productname} Proxy.
Its activation key must contain these child channels:

* openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} Updates (x86_64)
* Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)
* Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)

The activation key for retail terminals based on openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} must contain these child channels:

* openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} Updates (x86_64)
* Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)

For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



== Register the Branch Server and Terminals as Clients

You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients.
To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



=== Register the Branch Server

A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy.
The proxy can be bootstrapped using the {webui}, or at the command prompt.
Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy.

For more information about proxies, see xref:installation:uyuni-proxy-registration.adoc[].
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



.Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy
. Check  that the ``Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)`` channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page.

. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern:
+

----
zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy
----

. Finalize the proxy setup:
+
----
configure-proxy.sh
----
+
  [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script.
  For more information about the proxy setup script, see xref:installation:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc#uyuni-proxy-setup-confproxy[].

. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client's system profile and check [systemitem]``OS Image Build Host`` as a [guimenu]``Add-On System Types``.

. Configure the proxy to run as a branch server.
  For example:
+
----
retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id> --dedicated-nic eth1 \
    --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \
    --netmask 255.255.255.0 \
    --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \
    --server-domain branch.example.org \
    --branch-prefix uyuni
----
+
  For additional options,  use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.

// Old text, to be superseded by the standard phrases above.
Before you begin, ensure you have access to the ``opensuse_leap15_2`` parent channel.

// Use [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` to obtain all needed channels:

.Procedure: Synchronizing Software Channels

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, register the parent channel:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels opensuse_leap15_2
----

. Enable the child channels:
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels opensuse_leap15_2-updates
spacewalk-common-channels uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-152
spacewalk-common-channels opensuse_leap15_2-uyuni-client
----
+
  If registration is successful, this message is shown:
+
----
# Base channel 'openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)' - exists
----

. Synchronize all repositories, which will take a lot of time to finish:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync -c opensuse_leap15_2-x86_64
spacewalk-repo-sync -c opensuse_leap15_2-x86_64-updates
spacewalk-repo-sync -c opensuse_leap15_2-uyuni-client-x86_64
spacewalk-repo-sync -c uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-152-x86_64
----

// Trouble shooting:
If you do not enable the ``opensuse_leap15_2`` parent channel first, you will see the following error:

----
# ERROR: opensuse_leap15_2-x86_64 could not be found at the server
# ERROR: opensuse_leap15_2-uyuni-client-x86_64: redstone.xmlrpc.XmlRpcFault: unhandled internal exception: User 1 does not have access to channel opensuse_leap15_2-x86_64 or the channel does not exist
----
////

////
FIXME, ke: we should think about this later:

Next we need to adapt kiwi profile for Leap {opensuse-version}, it is possible to simply modify JeOS7 for SLE15SP2 by
dropping few SLE specific packages and directives:

         <bootsplash-theme>SLE</bootsplash-theme>
         <bootloader-theme>SLE</bootloader-theme>
         <package name="grub2-branding-SLE" bootinclude="true"/>
         <package name="SUSEConnect"/>
         <package name="suse-build-key"/>
         <package name="plymouth-branding-SLE"/>
         <package name="sles-release"/>
         <package name="rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage"/>

Side note: I plan to publish modified profile somewhere, but I haven't decided where yet as it is uyuni and
feature without support.

Then it is possible to build the image using modified kiwi profile and deploy it to terminal as usual (there is
nothing specific for Uuyni).

The rest of things (saltboot formula and formula for image syncing works just the same way as SUMA.)

Only thing that behaves differently is naming of terminals, for some reason dashes are used instead of
HWTYPE (for example). But fortunately it has no impact on (at least basic) functionality of terminal.
