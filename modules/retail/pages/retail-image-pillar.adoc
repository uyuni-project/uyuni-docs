= Image Pillar

If the built image type is [literal]``PXE``, a {salt} pillar is also generated.
Image pillars are stored in the database and the {salt} subsystem can access details about the generated image.
Details include where the image files are located and provided, image checksums, information needed for network boot, and more.

The generated pillar is available to all connected clients.

This is an example of Image Pillar:

Under the ``images`` section, we have a specific image called ``POS_Image_JeOS7`` with a version of ``7.1.0-1.`` It provides various details
such as the image's URL for download, architecture, hash, size, synchronization information, image type (in this case, ``pxe``), file system type,
file name, and an inactive flag to exclude it from auto-selection. Additionally, it references the corresponding boot image named ``POS_Image_JeOS7-7.1.0-1.``

The ``boot_images`` section contains information about the boot image ``POS_Image_JeOS7-7.1.0-1.`` It specifies the details about kernel and initrd.

Image pillar can be modified via API. 
This example retrieves the image pillar for a given image ID, and changes the [literal]``Inactive`` flag to [literal]``True``
and writes it back.
