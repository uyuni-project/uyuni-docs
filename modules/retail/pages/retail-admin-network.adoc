If you are intending to set up either an external or a shared network architecture, you need to ensure that the server providing DHCP services has PXE support enabled.

For example:

----
next-server: <branch server IP>
if option arch = 00:07 {
     filename "boot/shim.efi";
} else {
     filename "boot/pxelinux.0";
}
----

Your DNS servers can then resolve ``salt`` and ``ftp`` hostnames as CNAMEs to the correct branch server hostname.

For a description of the different networking architectures, see xref:retail:retail-network-arch.adoc[].
