If you are intending to set up either an external or a shared network architecture, you need to ensure that the server providing DHCP services has PXE support enabled.

For example:

----
next-server: <branch server IP>
if option arch = 00:07 {
     filename "boot/shim.efi";
} else {
     filename "boot/pxelinux.0";
}
----

Configure your DNS servers to resolve ``salt`` and ``ftp`` as CNAMEs to the correct branch server FQDN.

If using a CNAME is not possible, there are several workarounds:

* For ``salt``, set this kernel parameter when the terminal boots:
+
----
MASTER=<branch_server_fqdn>
----
+
You can configure this using the PXE formula.
For more information, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-pxe.adoc[].
* For ``ftp``, you can use an A record that resolves to an IP address instead of a CNAME.
Alternatively, you can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars.
