= Retail Uyuni Branch Server

This section covers {productname} {smr} Branch Server installation and setup, using these procedures:

* Add Software Channels
* Check Synchronization Status
* Trust GPG Keys on Clients
* Register the Branch Server and Terminals as Clients

The {productname} {smr} Branch Server is a {productname} Proxy with additional Retail features.
For proxy installation procedures, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-proxy-uyuni.adoc[] and xref:installation-and-upgrade:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc[].

Then continue with the following sections.



== Add Software Channels

Before you register {productname} branch servers and terminals to your {productname} Server, check that you have the {opensuse} product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized.

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[opensuse-channels-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
.OpenSUSE Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Base Channel
| Client Channel
| Updates Channel
| Non-OSS Channel
| Non-OSS Updates Channel
| Backports Updates Channel
| SLE Updates Channel

| {opensuse} Leap 15.4
| opensuse_leap15_4
| opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client
| opensuse_leap15_4-updates
| opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss
| opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates
| opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates
| opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates

== Check Synchronization Status

include::snippets/check_sync_webui_uyuni.adoc[]

include::snippets/check_sync_cli.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
{opensuse} channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.

== Trust GPG Keys on Clients

include::snippets/trust_gpg.adoc[]



// FIXME Starting from here, everything is preliminary
// Feedback provided by Lukas
== Create Activation Key for a Branch Server and the Retail Terminal Images

The branch server is based on the {productname} Proxy.
Its activation key must contain these child channels:

* openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} Updates (x86_64)
* Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)
* Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)

The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} must contain these child channels:

* openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} Updates (x86_64)
* Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)

For more information about creating activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



== Register the Branch Server and Terminals as Clients

You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients.
To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository.
By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.
You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command:

----
mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels
----

For more information on registering your clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



=== Register the Branch Server

A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy.
The proxy can be bootstrapped using the {webui}, or at the command prompt.
Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy.

For more information about proxies, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:uyuni-proxy-registration.adoc[].
For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



.Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy
. Check  that the ``Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap {opensuse-version} (x86_64)`` channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page.

. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern:
+

----
zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy
----

. Finalize the proxy setup:
+
----
configure-proxy.sh
----
+
  [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script.
  For more information about the proxy setup script, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc#uyuni-proxy-setup-confproxy[].

. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client's system profile and check [systemitem]``OS Image Build Host`` as a [guimenu]``Add-On System Types``.

. Configure the proxy to become a branch server.
  On the {productname} {smr} Server, for example, run:
+
----
retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id> --dedicated-nic eth1 \
    --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \
    --netmask 255.255.255.0 \
    --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \
    --server-domain branch.example.org \
    --branch-prefix uyuni
----
+
  For additional options,  use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.
