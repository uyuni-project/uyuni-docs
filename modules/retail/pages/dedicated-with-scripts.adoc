= Set Up the {productname} {smr} Environment with dedicated network for terminal using bundled scripts

To set up the {productname} {smr} environment, you will need to have already installed and configured:

* {productname} {smr} Server
* one or more {productname} {smr} branch server proxies
* one or more POS images built

== Assumptions

In this example we consider architecture with dedicated network for POS terminals where branch server provides all required services including DHCP and DNS.

For dedicated network we assume 192.168.86.0/24 network.

In this example we provide [systemitem]``salt`` and [systemitem]``ftp`` CNAMEs for {saltboot} service discovery.

We assume to have one regular branch server with salt minion id [systemitem]``branch1.mystore.com``, which is equal to the branch server fully qualified domain name, and branch id [systemitem]``B0001``.

As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer [systemitem]``TerminalOEM`` and model [systemitem]``T1000``.

For POS image we assume to have one with name [systemitem]``POS_Image_JeOS7``.

This example covers two configuration methods with both of them achieving same result.

== Quick set up of {productname} {smr} using {smr} tools

* {productname} {smr} provides command line tool [command]``retail_branch_init``
* {productname} {smr} provides mass import command line tool [command]``retail_yaml``

The branch server can be configured automatically using the [command]``retail_branch_init`` command, as shown in this section.

.Procedure: Configuring Branch Server Formulas With a Helper Script

. Run following command on {productname} Server:
+
----
retail_branch_init branch1.mystore.com --dedicated-nic eth1 \
                                       --branch-prefix B0001 \
                                       --server-domain branch1.mystore.com \
                                       --branch-ip 192.168.86.1 \
                                       --dyn-range 192.168.86.10 192.168.86.250 \
                                       --netmask 255.255.255.0
----
+
You can use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command for additional options.
+
. Verify that your changes have been configured correctly by checking the {productname} {webui} branch server system formulas.
. Apply highstate on the branch server.

Similar results can be achieved by using mass import command line tool.

.Procedure: Configuring Branch Server Formulas With a Mass Import Tool

. Prepare branch specific YAML file:
+
For example, create [systemitem]``branch.yaml`` file with content:
+
----
branches:
  branch1.mystore.com:
    branch_prefix: B0001
    server_domain: branch1.mystore.com
    nic: eth1
    dedicated_nic: true
    configure_firewall: true
    branch_ip: 192.168.86.1
    netmask: 255.255.255.0
    dyn_range:
        - 192.168.86.10
        - 192.168.86.250
----
+
For more information about mass import tool, see xref:retail:retail-mass-config.adoc[].
. Import branch information from YAML file to {productname}
+
----
retail_yaml --from-yaml branch.yaml
----
. Verify that your changes have been configured correctly by checking the {productname} {webui} branch server system formulas.
. Apply highstate on the branch server.

[WARNING]
====
Both [command]``retail_branch_init`` and [command]``retail_yaml`` commands override existing configuration settings of the specified branch server.
====

After the initial configuration done by command line tools, branch server configuration can be further adjusted in {productname} {webui} through branch server formulas.

== Setup partitioning

Follow xref:reference:systems/system-groups.adoc[] to create [systemitem]``HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000`` system group.

Partitioning is specific to the hardware type and configured using [systemitem]``Saltboot`` formula.

.Procedure: Assign {saltboot} formula to hardware type group

. Navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups]
. Select group [systemitem]``HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000``, which is our hardware type group
. Select the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab once in group details
. You should see list of formulas in [guimenu]``Configuration`` sub-tab
. In displayed list select [systemitem]``Saltboot``
. Save assigned formulas by clicking btn:[Save] in top right corner

.Procedure: Configure {saltboot} formula

. Select {saltboot} formula from [systemitem]``HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000`` group formula list
. Set [systemitem]``Disk Symbolic ID`` to [systemitem]``Disk1``
. Set [systemitem]``Device Type`` to [systemitem]``DISK``
. Set [systemitem]``Disk Device`` to [systemitem]``*``
. Set [systemitem]``Partition table type`` to [systemitem]``gpt``
. Click btn:[+] to add a partition
* Set [systemitem]``Partition Symbolic ID`` to [systemitem]``p1``
* Set [systemitem]``Partition Size (MiB)`` to [systemitem]``512``
* Set [systemitem]``Device Mount Point`` to [systemitem]``/boot/efi``
* Set [systemitem]``Filesystem Format`` to [systemitem]``vfat``
* Set [systemitem]``Partition Flags`` to [systemitem]``boot``
. Click btn:[+] to add a partition
* Set [systemitem]``Partition Symbolic ID`` to [systemitem]``p2``
* Set [systemitem]``Device Mount Point`` to [systemitem]``/``
* Set [systemitem]``OS Image to Deploy`` to [systemitem]``POS_Image_JeOS7``
. Save the formula

After all procedures are done, apply highstate on the branch server.

== Synchronize images

After highstate is applied, we proceed with synchronizing images as usual with apply [systemitem]``image-sync`` state.


Terminal can now be started and will be automatically provisioned, pending salt key acceptance.
