== Network Requirements

* The {susemgr} Server requires a reliable and fast WAN connection.
* The branch server requires a reliable WAN connection, to reach the {susemgr} Server.
* If you are using a dedicated network, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one connected to the WAN with reachable {susemgr} server, and one connected to the internal branch LAN.
* Terminals require a LAN connection to the branch server network.



== POS Terminal UEFI Secure Booting Requirements

Secure boot from the network using UEFI PXE or UEFI HTTP is supported on both {sles}{nbsp}12 and {sles}{nbsp}15.
Booting from a hard disk using UEFI Secure Boot is fully supported on {sles}{nbsp}15 images only.

You cannot boot {sles}{nbsp}12 images using UEFI secure boot from a hard disk.
This is due to limitations with the legacy Kiwi service.
You need to either disable UEFIÂ secure boot, or upgrade your terminals to {sles}{nbsp}15.
