Before you install {productname} {smr}, ensure your environment meets the minimum requirements.
This section lists the requirements for the {productname} {smr} installation.

Review also general requirements of the {productname} listed at
xref:installation-and-upgrade:general-requirements.adoc[].

== Server Requirements


[cols="1,3,2", options="header"]
.Server Hardware Requirements
|===

| Hardware
| Details
| Recommendation

| CPU
| {x86_64}
| Minimum 4 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores

| RAM
| Minimum
| 16 GB

|
| Recommended
| 32 GB

| Disk Space
| [path]``/`` (root directory)
| 40 GB

|
| [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``
| Minimum 150 GB (depending on the number of products)

|
| [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql``
| Minimum 50 GB

| Swap space
| Systems can benefit from additional swap space.   {suse} recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition.  For more information about swap space, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#installation-swap-space[].
| 8 to 12 GB
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
{productname} performance depends on hardware resources, network bandwidth, latency between clients and server, etc.

Based on the experience and different deployments that are in use, the advice for optimal performance of {productname} Server with an adequate number of proxies is to not exceed 10,000 clients per single server.
It is highly recommended to move to the Hub setup and involve consultancy when you have more than 10,000 clients.
Even with fine-tuning and an adequate number of proxies, such a large number of clients can lead to performance issues.

For more information about managing a large number of clients, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-multi-server.adoc[].

== Branch Server Requirements

[cols="1,3,2", options="header"]
.Branch Server Hardware Requirements
|===

| Hardware
| Details
| Recommendation

| CPU
| {x86_64}
| Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores

|
| Recommended
| The same as minimum values

| RAM
| Minimum
| 2 GB

|
| Recommended
| 8 GB

| Disk Space
| [path]``/`` (root directory)
| Minimum 40 GB

|
| [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes``
| Minimum 100 GB

| Swap space
| Systems can benefit from additional swap space.   {suse} recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition.  For more information about swap space, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#installation-swap-space[].
| 4 to 8 GB

== Build Host Requirements

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Hardware Requirements for Build Host
|===
| Hardware                 | Recommended
| CPU                      | Multi-core 64-bit CPU
| RAM:                     | _Test Server_ Minimum 2{nbsp}GB
|                          | _Production Server_ Minimum 4{nbsp}GB
| Disk Space:              | [path]``/`` _(root)_ Minimum 24{nbsp}GB
|                          | [path]``/var/lib/Kiwi`` Minimum 15{nbsp}GB
|===



== Network Requirements

* The {productname} Server requires a reliable and fast WAN connection.
* The branch server requires a reliable WAN connection, to reach the {productname} Server.
* If you are using a dedicated network, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one connected to the WAN with a reachable {productname} Server, and one connected to the internal branch LAN.
* Terminals require a LAN connection to the branch server network.



== POS Terminal Requirements

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Hardware Requirements for Terminals
|===
| Hardware                 | Recommended
| RAM:                     | Minimum 1 GB for hosts that need to run OS images built with Kiwi (PXE booted or not)
| Disk Space:              | Disk space depends on size of the OS image
|===

=== UEFI Secure Booting Requirements

// UEFI Secure Boot should work on Leap.
// 2020-08-27, ke: I think we do not need to mention this in the uyuni context

Secure boot from the network using UEFI PXE or UEFI HTTP is supported on both {sles}{nbsp}12 and {sles}{nbsp}15.
Booting from a hard disk using UEFI Secure Boot is fully supported on {sles}{nbsp}15 images only.

You cannot boot {sles}{nbsp}12 images using UEFI secure boot from a hard disk.
This is due to limitations with the legacy Kiwi service.
You need to either disable UEFI secure boot, or upgrade your terminals to {sles}{nbsp}15.
