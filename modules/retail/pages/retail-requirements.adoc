// ^^^ 2020-08-18, ke: Mentioning RH products here does not make sense.
//     Terminals are meant to run SLE/Leap.
//     If something different is wanted the user can check the install
//     as xref'ed above.



== Branch Server Requirements

.Hardware Requirements for Build Host
|===
| Hardware                 | Recommended
| CPU                      | Multi-core 64-bit CPU
| RAM:                     | _Test Server_ Minimum 2{nbsp}GB

== Network Requirements

* The {productname} Server requires a reliable and fast WAN connection.
* The branch server requires a reliable WAN connection, to reach the {productname} Server.
* If you are using a dedicated network, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one connected to the WAN with a reachable {productname} Server, and one connected to the internal branch LAN.
* Terminals require a LAN connection to the branch server network.



== POS Terminal Requirements

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Hardware Requirements for Terminals
|===
| Hardware                 | Recommended
| RAM:                     | Minimum 1 GB for hosts that need to run OS images built with Kiwi (PXE booted or not)
| Disk Space:              | Disk space depends on size of the OS image

For more information, see the documentation of the underlying system (in this case: {sles}{nbsp}15).

=== UEFI Secure Booting Requirements

// UEFI Secure Boot should work on Leap.
// 2020-08-27, ke: I think we do not need to mention this in the uyuni context

Secure boot from the network using UEFI PXE or UEFI HTTP is supported on both {sles}{nbsp}12 and {sles}{nbsp}15.
Booting from a hard disk using UEFI Secure Boot is fully supported on {sles}{nbsp}15 images only.

You cannot boot {sles}{nbsp}12 images using UEFI secure boot from a hard disk.
This is due to limitations with the legacy Kiwi service.
You need to either disable UEFI secure boot, or upgrade your terminals to {sles}{nbsp}15.
