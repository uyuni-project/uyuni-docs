[[retail.forced.saltboot.redeployment]]
= Forced {saltboot} image redeployment

Systems provisioned by {saltboot} are usually redeployed or repartitioned automatically when a new image is available, or {saltboot} partitioning changes.

Occasionally, however, it is needed to force {saltboot} to redeploy an image or repartition disk, even when automation would not do so.
For these situations, {saltboot} offers three ways to force redeployment or repartitioning:

* <<force.redeployment.using.grains>>
* <<force.redeployment.using.custom.info>>
* <<force.redeployment.using.formula>>

[WARNING]
====
Repartitioning of a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions.

[[force.redeployment.using.grains]]
== Force {saltboot} redeployment using {salt} grains

{saltboot} redeployment grains have no side effects, and do not require any further configuration.
The limitation is that terminal must be accessible by [systeminfo]``salt``.

.Procedure: Forcing {saltboot} to redeploy image
. On the {productname} Server, as root, apply this {salt} state at the command prompt:
+
----
salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy
----
+
. Restart the terminal to pick up the changes.


.Procedure: Forcing a {saltboot} to repartition the hard disk
. On the {productname} Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt:
+
----
salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_repartition
----
. Restart the terminal to pick up the changes.


[[force.redeployment.using.custom.info]]
== Force {saltboot} redeployment using custom info values

{saltboot} custom values remove the limitation on terminal being reachable by [systemitem]``salt``, however there are configuration steps.

Custom info keys and values can be also managed using API or [systemitem]``spacecmd`` command.
For more information, see xref:reference:spacecmd/custominfo.adoc[].

.Procedure: Create custom info key for image redeployment
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Custom System Info].
. Click [guimenu]``Create Key`` to create new [systemitem]``Custom Info Key``.
. As [guimenu]``Key Label`` fill in [systemitem]``saltboot_force_redeploy``.
. As [guimenu]``Description`` fill in [systemitem]``Force redeploy {saltboot} image``.
. Click [guimenu]``Create Key``.
+
[NOTE]
====
Creating [systemitem]``saltboot_force_redeploy`` custom key is a one time operation.
When created, it is available for repeated use.
====

.Procedure: Assign custom value for image redeployment
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Overview`` page of the system you want to redeploy.
. Select tab [guimenu]``Custom Info``.
. Click on [guimenu]``Create Value``.
. From the list of available keys click [guimenu]``saltboot_force_redeploy``.
. As [guimenu]``Value`` type [systemitem]``True``.
. Click [guimenu]``Update Key``.
. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.

[NOTE]
====
After terminal finishes booting, {saltboot} redeployment custom info setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment.
====

.Procedure: Create custom info key for disk repartitioning
. Navigate to menu::Systems[Custom System Info] page.
. Click [guimenu]``Create Key`` to create new [systemitem]``Custom Info Key``.
. As [guimenu]``Key Label`` fill in [systemitem]``saltboot_force_repartition``.
. As [guimenu]``Description`` fill in `Force terminal disk repartition`.
. Click [guimenu]``Create Key``.
+
[NOTE]
====
Creating [systemitem]``saltboot_force_repartition`` custom key is one time operation. 
Once created, it is available for repeated use.
====

.Procedure: Assign custom value for disk repartitioning
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Overview`` page of the system you want to redeploy.
. Select tab [guimenu]``Custom Info``.
. Click on [guimenu]``Create Value``.
. From the list of available keys click [guimenu]``saltboot_force_repartition``.
. As [guimenu]``Value`` type [systemitem]``True``.
. Click [guimenu]``Update Key``.
. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.


[[force.redeployment.using.formula]]
== Force {saltboot} redeployment using {saltboot} formula

{saltboot} redeployment formula data has a significant side effect in terms of using {saltboot} formula on the system level. 
This will probably mask further changes of {saltboot} formula on group level unless formula is manually unassigned from the terminal.

[WARNING]
====
{saltboot} formula is usually assigned to the hardware type group. 
Data visible on system level are inherited from this group.

Saving group formula on system level will cause data from group to be copied to the system.

This has the side effect that changes on group level, like hardware type group formula, will not be visible on system level unless system level formula is unassigned from the system.
====

[NOTE]
====
After terminal finishes booting, {saltboot} redeployment formula setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment.
====

.Procedure: Forcing a {saltboot} to redeploy image using {saltboot} formula
. Select the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab for the system you want to redeploy.
. Select {saltboot} formula.
. At the bottom check [guimenu]``Force image redeployment`` checkbox.
. Save the formula.
. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.

If your terminal encounters a problem with the file system or the partition table, you might need to remove the partition table and reformat the terminal.

.Procedure: Forcing a {saltboot} to remove the partition table
. Select the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab for the system you want to redeploy.
. Select {saltboot} formula.
. At the bottom check [guimenu]``Force disk repartition`` checkbox.
. Save the formula.
. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.
