= Set Up the {productname} {smr} Environment with non-containerized 4.3 branch server

// 2020-08-27, ke: We must settle on one term: "POS images" or "terminal images"

To set up the {productname} {smr} environment, you will need to have already installed and configured:

* {productname} {smr} Server
* one or more {productname} {smr} branch server proxies, or containerized proxy
* one or more {productname} build hosts

This section covers how to configure your {productname} {smr} environment, including:

* Prepare POS images
* Prepare system groups
* Configure services for {saltboot}
* Synchronize POS images to the branch servers

The very first time you set up the {productname} {smr} environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps.
You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with {productname} {smr}.

For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization.
If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers.

If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches.
You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server.

Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens.


== Prepare and Build Terminal Images

For information about {productname} image building, see xref:administration:image-management.adoc[].

{productname} {smr} POS images are images specifically tailored for {productname} {smr} environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism.


=== POS Image Templates

As starting point, {suse} provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage[].
These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, POS templates do not include a system user.
You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a {suse} provided template.
However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user.
You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed.
====


== Branch Identification and Architecture Topology

Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose [systemitem]``branch id``.

For information about the possible network topologies, see xref:retail:retail-network-arch.adoc[].

As a [systemitem]``branch id`` select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters.


== Required System Groups

{productname} {smr} requires:

- branch system group for every branch server proxy, using [systemitem]``branch id`` as its name
- hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using [systemitem]``HWTYPE:`` prefix in its name

For more information about hardware type groups, see xref:retail:retail-deploy-terminals.adoc[].


[WARNING]
====
Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail.
====

{productname} {smr} also recognizes two optional groups for better overview:

- [systemitem]``TERMINALS``
- [systemitem]``SERVERS``


You can create system groups using the {productname} {webui}.
Navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and click btn:[Create System Group].

For more information about system groups, see xref:reference:systems/system-groups.adoc[].

During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins:

- branch system group based on received [systemitem]``branch_id``. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal.
- HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make {saltboot} partitioning pillar available to the terminal.
- [systemitem]``TERMINALS`` if this group exists.


[NOTE]
====
{productname} {smr} command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically.
====

[NOTE]
====
In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources.
For more information about installing Prometheus, see xref:administration:monitoring.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources.
For more information about installing Ansible, see xref:administration:ansible-integration.adoc[].
====


== Configure Services for {saltboot}

{saltboot} technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals.
{saltboot} consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot {salt} states.

This section covers general information about generic {saltboot} requirements.
For configuration examples, see xref:retail:example-configurations.adoc[].


=== Enable PXE Network Boot in the Terminal Network

{saltboot} is usually used in network boot environment.
For this to work [systemitem]``DHCP`` service for the network terminal is connected to must have [systemitem]``PXE`` or sometimes called [systemitem]``BOOTP`` support enabled.

.Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled
====
  if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = "HTTPClient" {
    option vendor-class-identifier "HTTPClient";
    filename "<FQDN of branch server proxy>/saltboot/shim.efi";
  }
  else {
    if option arch = 00:07 {
       filename "boot/shim.efi";
       next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>;
    }
    else {
      filename "boot/pxelinux.0";
      next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>;
    }
  }
====

Notice two important options, [systemitem]``next-server`` which is set to the branch server IP address and [systemitem]``filename`` set to the [systemitem]``boot/pxelinux.0`` for BIOS based system and [systemitem]``boot/shim.efi`` for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Containerized branch proxy uses different [systemitem]``filename`` then regular branch server.

For containerized branch proxy set [systemitem]``filename`` to the [systemitem]``pxelinux.0`` for BIOS based system and [systemitem]``grub/shim.efi`` for UEFI systems with SecureBoot.
====


=== {saltboot} Service Discovery

{saltboot} requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image.
{saltboot} tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below.

For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful.
Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best.


==== Salt Master Discovery

During {saltboot} initrd start, integrated {salt} client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to.
This discovery is trying following steps:

- [systemitem]``MASTER`` kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master
- resolve [systemitem]``salt`` CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master
- use [systemitem]``salt`` as a Salt master

Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using fully qualified domain name in [systemitem]``MASTER`` or [systemitem]``salt`` CNAME is important.

If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to {productname}, {saltboot} may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work.
====

==== Download Server Discovery

Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from:

- [systemitem]``saltboot_download_server`` pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used
- [systemitem]``saltboot:download_server`` pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used
- resolve [systemitem]``ftp`` hostname

Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location.


=== Terminal Partitioning and Image Selection

Last piece for {saltboot} is to provide partitioning for terminal.
This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals.
For more information about hardware types, see xref:retail:retail-deploy-terminals.adoc[].

Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful {saltboot} deployment.
For configuration examples, see xref:retail:example-configurations.adoc[].


== Synchronize Images to the Branch Server

The OS image you use on the {productname} server must be synchronized for use to the branch server.
You can do this with the Salt [command]``image-sync`` state, part of the [systemitem]``Image Synchronization Formula``.

.Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server

. On the {productname} server, run this command:
+
----
salt <branch_server_minion_id> state.apply image-sync
----
. The image details will be transferred to [path]``/srv/saltboot`` on the branch server.

You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server.
Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly.
For more information about [systemitem]``Image Synchronization Formula``, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-imagesync.adoc[].
