== Branch server mass configuration

Branch servers are configured individually using formulas.
If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, you might find it easier to configure the terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each branch server individually.

// https://gitlab.suse.de/SLEPOS/SUMA_Retail/tree/master/python-susemanager-retail



=== Configure multiple branch servers

This procedure requires the [package]``python-susemanager-retail`` package, which is provided with {smr}.
Install the [package]``python-susemanager-retail`` package on the {susemgr} server.

.Procedure: Configuring multiple branch servers

. Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install.
An example YAML file is at the end of this chapter, for you to reference.
. On a clean {susemgr} installation, import the YAML file you have created:
+
----
retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml
----
You can use the [command]``retail_yaml --help`` command for additional options.

If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the [command]``retail_yaml --from-yaml`` command to upload the new configuration.


Use the empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure.
Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in xref:retail:retail-install-setup.adoc[].


[[retail.sect.admin.terminal_mass_config]]
== Terminal mass configuration

If you are working in an environment with many terminals, you might find it easier to configure the terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each terminal individually.

In order to do this, you will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals.
You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal.

[NOTE]
====
The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied.
In cases where there is a conflict, {susemgr} will ignore the request in the file.
This is especially important when designating hostnames.
You should always check the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method.

=== Configure multiple terminals

.Procedure: Configuring multiple terminals

. Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal.
An example YAML file is at the end of this chapter, for you to reference.
. On a clean {susemgr} installation, import the YAML file you have created:
+
----
retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml
----
+
You can use the [command]``retail_yaml --help`` command for additional options.
. In the {susemgr} {webui}, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available.
. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers.
For further information on these steps, see the {susemgr} documentation.
. Apply highstate to apply your configuration changes.
In the [guimenu]``States`` tab, click btn:[Apply Highstate].
. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan.


If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the [command]``retail_yaml --from-yaml`` command to upload the new configuration.

If you have a current configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use:
----
retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml
----
This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file.
However it is important to check the file before using it, as some mandatory configuration entries will be missing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID.
If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.

== Example YAML file for mass configuration

// Ensure this section stays at the end of the chapter, its location is referenced earlier in this file. -LKB

You can use the [command]``retail_yaml`` command to import configuration parameters from a pre-prepared YAML file.
This section contains a commented example YAML file for you to reference.
