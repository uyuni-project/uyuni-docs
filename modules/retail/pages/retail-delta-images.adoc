= Delta Images

If you have very large images that you need to synchronize to the branch server, you can use delta images to save network bandwidth.

A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images.
If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small.
Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image.



== Building Delta Images

The [command]``retail_create_delta`` tool creates a delta image on the {productname} server.
The tool uses [command]``xdelta3`` internally.

Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command.
The format of the parameters must be `<NAME>-<VERSION>` and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar.
For example, if the pillar contains:

----
images:
  POS_Image_JeOS6:
    6.0.0:
      ...
    6.0.1:
      ...
  POS_Image_Graphical6:
    6.0.0:
      ...
----

Then the [command]``retail_create_delta`` command is:

----
retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0
----

This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1.
The resulting delta file is saved in [path]``/srv/www/os-images`` and the corresponding pillar file in [path]``/srv/susemanager/pillar_data/images/``.



== Tuning Delta Generation

Performance tuning is possible with the ``-B <VALUE>`` option, which is passed to [command]``xdelta3``.
With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements.
For more information, see the [command]``xdelta3`` documentation ([command]``man xdelta3``).



== Image Synchronizing to the Branch Server

When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the ``image-sync-formula`` first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server.
Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.
