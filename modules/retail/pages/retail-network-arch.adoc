= Network Architecture

{productname} {smr} uses a layered architecture:

* The first layer contains the {productname} Server.
* The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services.
  It also contains one or more build hosts.
* The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals.

Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office.
We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals.
Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages).
The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services.

== Branch Server Network Configuration

You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements.

=== Shared Network Architecture
The branch server and the terminals are connected to the same network as the {productname} Server.
In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network.

=== Externally Managed Dedicated Network Architecture
The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage.
In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides proxy, PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network.

=== Dedicated Network Architecture (using 4.3 branch server)
The branch servers are in the same network as the {productname} Server, and terminals use an isolated branch network.
In this configuration, the branch servers are in the corporate network, and provide all DHCP, DNS, PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in the branch networks.
