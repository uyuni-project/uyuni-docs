= Set Up the {productname} {smr} Environment using containerized proxy

To set up the {productname} {smr} environment, you will need to have already installed and configured:

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]
* {productname} {smr} Server 4.3 or newer
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
* {productname} {smr} Server
endif::[]

* one or more {productname} {smr} containerized proxies
* one or more {productname} build host

This section covers how to configure your  environment using containerized {productname} Proxy for [systemitem]``Saltboot`` deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configures DHCP for PXE booting.
Without the formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy.
For more information how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-dhcpd.adoc[].
====


== Requirements and assumptions

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]
* Containerized workflow requires POS images build using {productname} Server 4.3 or newer.
  Older images will not work.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
* Containerized workflow requires POS images build using the newest {productname} Server.
endif::[]

* In this example we are going to use branch id [systemitem]``B0001``.

* As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer [systemitem]``TerminalOEM`` and model [systemitem]``T1000``.

* For POS image we assume to have one with name [systemitem]``POS_Image_JeOS7``.


== Create required system groups

.Procedure
. Create the following three system groups. 
  For guidelines on how to create the groups, see xref:reference:systems/system-groups.adoc[].

  - [systemitem]``TERMINALS``
  - [systemitem]``HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000``
  - [systemitem]``B0001``
+
The first group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. 
The second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. 
The third group is mandatory branch group.
+
For more information about {saltboot} groups, see xref:retail:retail-install-setup.adoc[].
+
. Assign [systemitem]``Saltboot Group`` formula to group [systemitem]``B0001`` we just created. 
  This converts the  branch group to [systemitem]``Saltboot Group``.


== {saltboot} group

Containerized {productname} {smr} is configured in [systemitem]``Saltboot Group``.

{saltboot} groups are branch groups, system group with [systemitem]``branch id`` as its name and [systemitem]``Saltboot Group`` formula enabled.

[systemitem]``Saltboot Group`` formula is a successor of [systemitem]``Branch Network formula``, [systemitem]``PXE formula`` and [systemitem]``TFTP formula`` used in regular {productname} {smr} setups.

Name of the [systemitem]``Saltboot Group`` is automatically used as a [systemitem]``branch id``, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized {productname} Proxy.

All [systemitem]``Saltboot`` deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its [systemitem]``Saltboot group``.

To connect [systemitem]``Saltboot group`` with containerized proxy, fill [systemitem]``Image Download Server`` entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name ([literal]``FQDN``) of the containerized proxy.

With this, mandatory configuration is finished. 
The rest of configuration is optional.


=== Default boot image

Configure [systemitem]``Default boot image for new registrations`` to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal.

This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments.
Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image.

If [systemitem]``Default boot image for new registrations`` is set, option to set its version appears under name [systemitem]``Default boot image version`` where specific image version can be set.


=== Kernel option for the {saltboot} group

Option [systemitem]``Kernel parameters for the group`` can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this {saltboot} group.


=== Naming scheme for new registrations

Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in {productname} Server.

For explanation of possible configurations, see xref:retail:retail-terminal-names.adoc[].


== Comparing containerized and non-containerized workflows

External DHCP service must be used with containerized {saltboot}.

For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see xref:retail:retail-install-setup.adoc[].

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]
Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in {productname} Server 4.3, where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in {productname} Server, where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually.
endif::[]

Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to {productname} Server.

Containerized proxy is not a {salt} client, it is not possible to call [systemitem]``image-sync`` state.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Once POS image is built and made available on {productname} Server, it is immediately available to the {saltboot} clients as well. 
Image synchronization is not needed, nor available.
This may have implications on how images are deployed to production.
====

The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow.
Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of {productname} {smr} Branch Server) are available.


//Containerized workflow::

.Procedure: Deploying with containerized workflow
. Build POS image
. Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network
. Create [systemitem]``Saltboot group`` and configure it for existing containerized proxy
. Boot system to be deployed


//Non-Containerized workflow::

.Procedure: Deploying with non-ontainerized workflow
. Build POS image
. Configure and apply Retail formulas on {productname} {smr} Branch server
. Apply [systemitem]``highstate`` state on the Branch server
. Create [systemitem]``branch group`` with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas
. Apply [systemitem]``image-sync`` state on configured {productname} {smr} Branch server
. Boot system to be deployed


== Validating {saltboot} group configuration

[systemitem]``Containerized Saltboot`` utilizes [systemitem]``Cobbler`` system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration.

When new PXE image is built (such as {productname} {smr} POS_Image_JeOS images) [systemitem]``cobbler distro`` and [systemitem]``cobbler profile`` are automatically generated for this image.

For example, when first image [literal]``POS_Image_JeOS`` version [literal]``7.0.0`` is build under organization with number 1 [command]``cobbler list`` will show:

----
# cobbler list

distros:
   1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1

profiles:
   1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1
----

These entries contain information about kernel and initrd.
These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting.

Only when [systemitem]``Saltboot group`` is created, new {cobbler} profile is created for this [systemitem]``Saltboot group`` which points to [systemitem]``cobbler distro`` based on default boot image configuration.


For example, when system group [literal]``B0001`` is created and [systemitem]``Saltboot group formula`` is assigned and configured for this group, new {cobbler} profile is created.

----
# cobbler list

distros:
   1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1

profiles:
   1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1
   1-B0001
----

When inspecting this new group using command [command]``cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001`` details of this profile reveal configuration of this {saltboot} group.

----
# cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001

Name                           : 1-B0001
Comment                        : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile
Distribution                   : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1
Kernel Options                 : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']}
----

Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for {saltboot} functionality.

With this information [systemitem]``Cobbler`` is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in [path]``/srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default`` and [path]``/srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg``.

These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with which parameters.
