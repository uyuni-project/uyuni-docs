== What is {productname}?

// [#salt.gloss] may be used to create a tooltip for a glossary term: see branding/supplemental-ui/suma/sumacom/partials/footer-scripts.hbs

{productname} is a solution for organizations that require robust control over maintenance and package deployment on their servers.
It enables you to manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up-to-date, with automated software management, asset management, and system provisioning.
It also allows you to maintain a high level of security while effectively managing system life-cycle requirements.

{productname} uses {salt} to provide event-driven configuration and management control.
The Salt-master orchestrates tens of thousands of {salt} clients ({productname} clients) using remote execution.

{productname} offers seamless management of {sle}, {opensuse}, {rhel}, {centos}, {oracle}, {ubuntu}, {debian}, {amazon}, {almalinux}, and {raspberrypios} client systems.
They can be on-premise, or on public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud or even multi-cloud environments.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you cannot use the {productname} {webui}, almost all functionality (with the exception of virtualization tasks) is available from the command prompt.
All command line tools can be used with assistive technology tools.
Text readers ``orca`` and ``espeak`` can be enabled in the Desktop Applications Module.
Speech recognition ``mycroft-core`` and ``sphinx`` are available in PackageHub.
Additionally, you can interact with {productname} using the XML-RPC API.
