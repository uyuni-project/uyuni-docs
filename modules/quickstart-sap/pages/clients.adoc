= Register Clients

Add some configuration file typically used for SAP to a configuration channel and to an activation key


When you have your {productname} Server set up, you are ready to start registering clients.

You can use {productname} to manage clients using either the Salt stack or the traditional stack (inherited from Spacewalk).
Most new features and enhancements are only available for Salt-managed clients, which makes this stack the preferred one.
For more details, see xref:client-configuration:supported-features.adoc[]

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping], then fill in the ``Host``, ``SSH Port``, ``User`` and ``Password`` fields.
Make sure you use stable FQDNs for the ``Host`` field, or {productname} will not be able to find your host when your Public Cloud gives you a different short-lived FQDNS.

Public cloud images usually do not allow SSH login with username and password, but only SSH with a certificate.
If you want to use bootstrap from the {webui}, you will need to enable SSH login with username and password.
You can do this by navigating to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping] and changing the authentication method.

When the bootstrap process has completed successfully, your client will be listed at menu:Systems[System List].

* If you want more control over the process, have to register many clients, or are registering traditional clients, we recommend that you create a bootstrap script.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
* For Salt clients and even more control over the process, executing single commands on the command line can be useful.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-cli.adoc[].
