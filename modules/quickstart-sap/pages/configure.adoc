= Configure Clients

{productname} uses formulas with forms to configure your SAP clients.
There are two formulas that you need to use: ``habootstrap`` to configure the HANA database, and ``FIXME`` to configure the clients into a cluster.

The formulas are provided by packages that you can download from your package manager.
You need to install the formulas on the {productname} Server.
When you have installed the package, you can use the {productname} {webui} to enable and configure the formulas.
As you go through the formula configuration process, you will be able to provide the details of the clients that contain your SAP cluster, to set them up appropriately.

To install the formulas on the {productname} Server, use your package manager to install these packages:

* ``saphanabootstrap-formula``
* ``sapnwbootstrap-formula``
* ``drbd-formula``
* ``habootstrap-formula``
* ``salt-shaptools``


[IMPORTANT]
====
The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important.
You must enable, configure, and apply the HANA formula first.
Then you can enable, configure, and apply the cluster formula.
If you perform these steps in the wrong order, your SAP installation will fail.
====



== Enable and Configure the HANAÂ Formula

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and click the client to use as the primary client in the cluster.

Navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab and check the ``habootstrap`` formula in the list.
Click btn:[Save] and apply the highstate to install the formula.

When the formula is applied, you can navigate to the menu:Formulas[Habootstrap] tab, and complete the details in the form.

Make sure you check [guimenu]``Install required packages`` to install everything you need on the client.
In the [guimenu]``First node`` field, type the hostname of the client to use as the primary client in the cluster.

Complete the remaining details according to your environment, click btn:``Save``, and apply the highstate.
When the highstate is complete, you can go on to apply the cluster formula.



== Enable and Configure the Cluster

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and click the ``FIXME`` client.
This is the FIXME.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab and check the formula in the list.
Click btn:``Save`` and apply the highstate to save the changes.

When the formula is applied, you can navigate to the menu:Formulas[Cluster] tab, and complete the details in the form.
//Make sure you ... FIXME

Make sure that you provide the passwords for all the other clients you want included in the cluster.
Alternatively, you need to ensure that all of the clients can connect to each other directly using SSH.

When you have completed all the details, click btn:``Save`` and apply the highstate.
When the highstate is complete, your SAP cluster is ready to use.
