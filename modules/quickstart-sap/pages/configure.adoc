= Configure Clients

{productname} uses formulas with forms to configure your SAP clients.
There are two formulas that you need to use:

* ``Hana`` to configure the HANA database
* ``Cluster`` to configure the clients into a cluster

The formulas are provided by packages that you can download with your package manager.
You need to install the formulas on the {productname} Server.
When you have installed the package, you can use the {productname} {webui} to enable and configure the formulas.
As you go through the formula configuration process, you will be able to provide the details of the clients that contain your SAP cluster, to set them up appropriately.

To install the formulas on the {productname} Server, use your package manager to install these packages:

* ``saphanabootstrap-formula``
* ``sapnwbootstrap-formula``
* ``drbd-formula``
* ``habootstrap-formula``
* ``salt-shaptools``


[IMPORTANT]
====
The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important.
You must enable, configure, and apply the HANA formula first.
Then you can enable, configure, and apply the cluster formula.
If you perform these steps in the wrong order, your SAP installation will fail.

== Enable and Configure the HANAÂ Formula

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List] and click the client to use as the primary client in the cluster.

Navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab, locate the ``Sap Hana Deployment`` heading, and check the ``Hana`` formula in the list.
Click btn:[Save] and apply the highstate to activate the formula.

When the formula is activated, navigate to the menu:Formulas[Hana] tab, and complete the details in the form.

Make sure you check [guimenu]``Install required packages`` to install everything you need on the client.
In the [guimenu]``Nodes`` sections, type the hostname of the client to install the HANA database, and provide details for the installation.

Complete the remaining details according to your environment, click btn:[Save], and apply the highstate.
When the highstate is complete, you can go on to apply the cluster formula.
