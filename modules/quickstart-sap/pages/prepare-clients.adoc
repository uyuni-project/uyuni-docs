= Preparing Clients

Your SAP cluster requires several client systems.
Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have {sles}{nbsp}15 for SAP installation media ready on your {productname} Server.
You will not be able to create an SAP cluster without the {sles} SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP.

One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster.
Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection.
When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this.
For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP1/html/SLES4SAP-quick/cha-s4s-plan.html#sec-s4s-hardware[].

For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all[].



== Register Clients to the {SCC}

Register each client with {scc}, using this command as root, specifying the registration number and the email address associated with it:

----
SUSEConnect -r <Registration_Number> -e <registered_email_address>
----

You can get your registration number by logging in to {scc} from your browser.

For more information about registering {productname} with {scc}, see xref:installation:general-requirements.adoc[].



== Create the Cluster

Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their [path]``/etc/hosts`` file.
Open the [path]``/etc/hosts`` file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients.



== Create a Shared Storage Device

Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk.
The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI.

If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system.
Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk.



== Download the SAP Installation Software

Download the {sles}{nbsp}15 with SAP installation media from {scc}, and save a copy on each clients.
Ensure you have saved it in the same file path on each client.



== Configure Clients to Use Latest ``module.run``

Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of ``module.run``.
On the {productname} Server, open the ``/etc/salt/master`` configuration file and add or amend this line:

----
- 'use_superseded:'
      - '- module.run'
----


== Install Additional Disks for HANA


For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you will require an additional storage device.
This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the [path]``/hana/`` directory.

We recommend that this storage device be at least 20{nbsp}GB.
For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage.
For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all[].



== Register Clients to the Server

In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstrapping].
Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the [guimenu]``Manage System Completely via SSH`` checkbox.
In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` field, select the activation key that is associated with the software channel you want to use to bootstrap the client.

For more information about activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].
For more information about registering, see xref:client-configuration:registration-webui.adoc[].
