= Setting Up

Add products, sync repositories (very short, I think for the SAP quickguide we do not need to cover custom repositories, so it should be doable with the UI alone)
Create bootstrap repositories and activation keys



== Activation Keys

Activation keys are used with traditional and Salt clients to ensure that your clients have the correct software entitlements, are connecting to the appropriate channels, and are subscribed to the relevant groups.
Each activation key is bound to an organization, which you can set when you create the key.

.Procedure: Creating an Activation Key
. In the {productname} {webui}, as an administrator, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click the btn:[Create Key] button.
. On the [guimenu]``Activation Key Details`` page, in the [guimenu]``Description`` field, enter a name for the activation key.
. In the [guimenu]``Key`` field, enter the distribution and service pack associated with the key.
For example, ``SLES12-SP4`` for {sles}{nbsp}12{nbsp}SP4.

====
Do not use commas in the [guimenu]``Key`` field for any {suse} products.
However, you *must* use commas for Red Hat Products.
For more information, see xref:reference:systems/activation-keys.adoc[].

. In the [guimenu]``Base Channels`` drop-down box, select the appropriate base software channel, and allow the relevant child channels to populate.
For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc#vle.webui.admin.wizard.products[] and xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].
. Select the child channels you need (for example, the mandatory {susemgr} tools and updates channels).
. We recommend you leave the [guimenu]``Contact Method`` set to [guimenu]``Default``.
. We recommend you leave the [guimenu]``Universal Default`` setting unchecked.
. Click btn:[Create Activation Key] to create the activation key.
. Check the [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` check box to enable configuration management for this key, and click btn:[Update Activation Key] to save this change.

[NOTE]
[.admon-note]
====
The [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` check box does not appear until after you have created the activation key.
Ensure you go back and check the box if you need to enable configuration management.
