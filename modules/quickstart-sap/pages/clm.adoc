= Content Lifecycle Management


Content lifecycle management allows you to customize repositories and test packages before updating production clients.
This is especially useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window.

This is achieved through a series of environments that your software channels can move through on their lifecycle.
Most environment lifecycles include at least test and production environments, but you can have as many environments as you require.

When you have created your project, defined environments, and attached sources and filters, you can build the project for the first time.
For more information about content lifecycle management, see xref:administration:content-lifecycle.adoc[].

When your project is built successfully, you will need to add the new channel to an activation key.
For more information about custom channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].



.Procedure:Â Creating a Content Lifecycle Project

Go to menu:Content Lifecycle[Projects], create a project and assign it a label and a name. Then use btn:[Attach/Detach Sources] to attach a base channel and child channels, and finally save.

You can now btn:[Attach/Detach Filters] to fine tune what packages will be included in the resulting channel. A number of filters are available: name, date, synopsis, reboot required or not, etc.

At this point you can define your environments by clicking btn:[Add Environment] in the [guimenu]``Environment Lifecycle`` dialog. Test and Production are usually the bare minimum most customers will have but you may need more. Continue creating environments until you have all the  environments for your lifecycle completed.

The final step is building the project, which will take a little while.
