= Signing Repository Metadata

You require a custom GPG key to be able to sign repository metadata.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To access a shell inside the Server container run [literal]``mgrctl term`` on the container host.
====

.Procedure: Generating a Custom GPG Key
. As the root user, use the [command]``gpg`` command to generate a new key:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- gpg --gen-key
----
+
. At the prompts, select [systemitem]``RSA`` as the key type, with a size of 2048 bits, and select an appropriate expiry date for your key.
    Check the details for your new key, and type [systemitem]``y`` to confirm.
. At the prompts, enter a name and email address to be associated with your key.
    You can also add a comment to help you identify the key, if desired.
    When you are happy with the user identity, type [systemitem]``O`` to confirm.
. At the prompt, enter a passphrase to protect your key.
. The key should be automatically added to your keyring.
    You can check by listing the keys in your keyring:
+
----
gpg --list-keys
----
+
. Add the password for your keyring to the [filename]``/etc/rhn/signing.conf`` configuration file, by opening the file in your text editor and adding this line:
+
----
GPGPASS="password"
----

For renewing a GPG key, see xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-sync.adoc[].


You can manage metadata signing on the command line using the [command]``mgr-sign-metadata-ctl`` command.


.Procedure: Enabling Metadata Signing
. You need to know the short identifier for the key to use.
    You can list your available public keys in short format:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- gpg --keyid-format short --list-keys
...
pub   rsa2048/3E7BFE0A 2019-04-02 [SC] [expires: 2021-04-01]
      A43F9EC645ED838ED3014B035CFA51BF3E7BFE0A
uid         [ultimate] SUSE Manager
sub   rsa2048/118DE7FF 2019-04-02 [E] [expires: 2021-04-01]
----
+
. Enable metadata signing with the [command]``mgr-sign-metadata-ctl`` command:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- mgr-sign-metadata-ctl enable 3E7BFE0A
OK. Found key 3E7BFE0A in keyring.
DONE. Set key 3E7BFE0A in /etc/rhn/signing.conf.
DONE. Enabled metadata signing in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf.
DONE. Exported key 4E2C3DD8 to /srv/susemanager/salt/gpg/mgr-keyring.gpg.
DONE. Exported key 4E2C3DD8 to /var/spacewalk/gpg/<KEY_NAME>.key.
NOTE. For the changes to become effective run:
   mgr-sign-metadata-ctl regen-metadata
----
. You can check that your configuration is correct with this command:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- mgr-sign-metadata-ctl check-config
----
. Restart the services and schedule metadata regeneration to pick up the changes:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- mgr-sign-metadata-ctl regen-metadata
----

You can also use the [command]``mgr-sign-metadata-ctl`` command to perform other tasks.
Use [command]``mgr-sign-metadata-ctl --help`` to see the complete list.

Repository metadata signing is a global option.
When it is enabled, it is enabled on all software channels on the server.
This means that all clients connected to the server need to trust the new  GPG key to be able to install or update packages.



.Procedure: Importing GPG keys on Clients
. Deploying GPG keys to the clients works with salt states.

. Apply the highstate with the {productname} {webui}.
