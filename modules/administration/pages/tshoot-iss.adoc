Cause: Caches on the ISS slave and master can contain old or out-of-date entries.
Consequence: Synchronizing fails, with ``ERROR: Encountered IntegrityError``.
Fix: Delete the cache on the slave and the master
Result: Synchronization completes successfully.

Inter-server synchronization uses caches to manage the ISS Master and Slaves.
These caches can be prone to bugs that create invalid entries.
In this case, bugs can show up even after updating to a version that resolves the bug, because the cache is still using invalid entries.
If you upgrade to a new version of ISS, but are still experiencing problems, clear all the caches to ensure you no longer have old entries creating a problem.

Cache errors can lead to synchronization failing with a variety of errors, but the error message will usually report something like this:

----
consider removing satellite-sync cache at /var/cache/rhn/satsync/* and re-run satellite-sync with same options.
----

You can resolve this by deleting the cache on the ISS Master and the ISS Slave, so that synchronization completes successfully.



.Procedure: Resolving ISS Caching Errors
. On the ISS Master, at the command prompt, as root, delete the cache file for the Master:
+
----
rm -rf /var/cache/rhn/xml-*
----
. Restart the service:
+
----
rcapache2 restart
----
. On the ISS Master, at the command prompt, as root, delete the cache file for the Slave:
+
----
rm -rf /var/cache/rhn/satsync/*
----
. Restart the service:
+
----
rcapache2 restart
----
