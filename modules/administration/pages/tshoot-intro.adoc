= Troubleshooting

This section contains some common problems you might encounter with {productname}, and solutions to resolving them.

Before you begin troubleshooting, you might want to produce some reports from your system to help you understand what is going on.



== Producing Reports

The [command]``spacewalk-report`` command is used to produce a variety of reports for system administrators.
These reports can be helpful for taking inventory of your entitlements, subscribed systems, users, and organizations.
Using reports is often simpler than gathering information manually from the {susemgr} {webui}, especially if you have many systems under management.

.[package]``spacewalk-reports`` Package
NOTE: To use spacewalk-report, you must have the [package]``spacewalk-reports`` package installed.

[command]``spacewalk-report`` allows administrators to organize and display reports about content, systems, and user resources across {susemgr}.
Using [command]``spacewalk-report``, you can receive reports on:

. System Inventory: lists all of the systems registered to {susemgr}.
. Entitlements: lists all organizations on {susemgr}, sorted by system or channel entitlements.
. Patches: lists all the patches relevant to the registered systems and sorts patches by severity, as well as the systems that apply to a particular patch.
. Users: lists all the users registered to {susemgr} and any systems associated with a particular user.

[command]``spacewalk-report`` allows administrators to organize and display reports about content, systems, and user resources across {susemgr}.
To get the report in CSV format, run the following at the command line of your {susemgr} server.
