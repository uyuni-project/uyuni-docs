= Live Patching on SLES{nbsp}12


On SLES{nbsp}12 systems, live patching is managed by kGraft.
For in depth information covering kGraft use, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-kgraft.html.

Before you begin, ensure:

* {productname} is fully updated.
* You have one or more Salt clients running SLES{nbsp}12 (SP1 or later).
* Your SLES{nbsp}12 Salt clients are registered with {productname}.
* You have access to the SLES{nbsp}12 channels appropriate for your architecture, including the live patching child channel (or channels).
* The clients are fully synchronized.
* Assign the clients to the cloned channels prepared for live patching.
For more information on preparation, see xref:administration:live-patching-channel-setup.adoc[].

. Apply the highstate to enable Live Patching, and reboot the client.
. Repeat for each client that you want to manage with Live Patching.
. To check that live patching has been enabled correctly, select the client from menu:Systems[System List], and ensure that [systemitem]``Live Patching`` appears in the [guimenu]``Kernel`` field.



.Procedure: Applying Live Patches to a Kernel

. Click btn:[Critical] to see a list of the available critical patches.
. Select any patch with a synopsis reading [guimenu]``Important: Security update for the Linux kernel``.
Security bugs will also include their CVE number, where applicable.
. OPTIONAL: If you know the CVE number of a patch you want to apply, you can search for it in menu:Audit[CVE Audit], and apply the patch to any clients that require it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Not all kernel patches are Live Patches!
Non-Live kernel patches are represented by a `Reboot Required` icon located next to the `Security` shield icon.
These patches will always require a reboot.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Not all security issues can be fixed by applying a live patch.
Some security issues can only be fixed by applying a full kernel update and will require a reboot.
The assigned CVE numbers for these issues are not included in live patches.
A CVE audit will display this requirement.
