= Live Patching on SLES{nbsp}12


On SLES{nbsp}12 systems, live patching is managed by kGraft.
For in depth information covering kGraft use, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/cha-kgraft.html.

Before you begin, ensure:

* {productname} is fully updated.
* You have one or more Salt clients running SLES{nbsp}12 (SP1 or later).
* Your SLES{nbsp}12 Salt clients are registered with {productname}.
* You have access to the SLES{nbsp}12 channels appropriate for your architecture, including the live patching child channel (or channels).
* The clients are fully synchronized.
* Assign the clients to the cloned channels prepared for live patching.
    For more information on preparation, see xref:administration:live-patching-channel-setup.adoc[].



.Procedure: Setting up for Live Patching

. Select the client you want to manage with Live Patching from menu:Systems[Overview], and on the system details page navigate to the menu:Software[Packages > Install] tab.
    Search for the [systemitem]``kgraft`` package, and install it.

. Apply the highstate to enable Live Patching, and reboot the client.
. Repeat for each client that you want to manage with Live Patching.
. To check that live patching has been enabled correctly, select the client from menu:Systems[System List], and ensure that [systemitem]``Live Patching`` appears in the [guimenu]``Kernel`` field.



.Procedure: Applying Live Patches to a Kernel

. In the {productname} {webui}, select the client from menu:Systems[Overview].
    A banner at the top of the screen shows the number of critical and non-critical packages available for the client:

. Click btn:[Critical] to see a list of the available critical patches.
. Select any patch with a synopsis reading [guimenu]``Important: Security update for the Linux kernel``.
    Security bugs also include their CVE number, where applicable.
. OPTIONAL: If you know the CVE number of a patch you want to apply, you can search for it in menu:Audit[CVE Audit], and apply the patch to any clients that require it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Not all kernel patches are Live Patches.
  Non-Live kernel patches are represented by a `Reboot Required` icon located next to the `Security` shield icon.
  These patches always require a reboot.
*  Not all security issues can be fixed by applying a live patch.
  Some security issues can only be fixed by applying a full kernel update and require a reboot.
  The assigned CVE numbers for these issues are not included in live patches.
  A CVE audit displays this requirement.
