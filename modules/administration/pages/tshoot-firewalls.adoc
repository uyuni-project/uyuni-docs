Cause: User firewall is set to block outgoing traffic by dropping the packet request. During sync with SCC, SUMA waits for an answer on each URL until it times out, eventually causing the entire refresh of the product list to timeout. Applies only to third party (non-SUSE) products, as sync with SCC needs to access locations other than SCC to verify if the if the download location is valid.

Consequence: The sync to SCC fails, and the third party products are not shown in the product list.

Fix: Configure the firewall to reject requests from SUMA instead of drop (preferred), or configure a firewall on the server (if no ability to change firewall settings)

Result: Sync toÂ SCC will either be able to reach the URLs required, or will have request rejected so that the request fails rather than times out.

If you are using a firewall that blocks outgoing traffic, it will either ``REJECT`` or ``DROP`` network requests.
If it is set to ``DROP`` then you might find that synchronizing with the {scc} times out.

This occurs because the synchronization process needs to access third-party repositories that provide packages for non-{suse} clients, and not just the {scc}.
When the {productname} Server attempts to reach these repositories to check that they are valid, the firewall drops the requests, and the synchronization continues to wait for the response until it times out.

If this occurs, you will notice that the synchronization will take a long time before it fails, and that your non-{suse} products are not shown in the product list.

You can fix this problem in several different ways.

The simplest method is to configure your firewall to allow access to the URLs required by non-{suse} repositories.
This allows the synchronization process to reach the URLs and complete successfully.

If allowing external traffic is not possible, configure your firewall to ``REJECT`` requests from {productname} instead of ``DROP``.
This rejects requests to third-party URLs, so that the synchronization fails early rather than times out, and the products are not shown in the list.

If you do not have configuration access to the firewall, you can consider setting up a separate firewall on the {productname} Server instead.
