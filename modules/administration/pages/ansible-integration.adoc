[[ansible-integration]]
= Ansible integration

Currently, the supported version of Ansible is 2.9 (LTS) shipped in SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Client Tools channels.
The supported OS version for the Ansible Control Node is SLES 15 SP3, or later.
Ansible software is also available for {productname} Proxy and {productname} {smr} Branch Server.
For Control Nodes running operating systems other than SUSE Linux Enterprise, use Ansible shipped together with your distribution.



[[at.ansible.overview]]
== Feature Overview

{productname} enables system administrators to operate their Ansible Control Nodes.
Supported features are:

* inspection of inventory files
* discovery of playbooks
* execution of playbooks



[[at.ansible.requirements]]
== Requirements

To use Ansible features, you need to register your Ansible Control Node system as a Salt client to your {productname} Server.
When registered, you must enable the ``Ansible Control Node`` system type in the [guimenu]``Add-on System Types`` on the menu:System Details[Properties] page of that system.

Enabling this system type ensures that the ``ansible`` package is installed on the system by adding it in the highstate and activates the Ansible features under the menu:System Details[Ansible] page.

As the next step, configure the paths to your Ansible inventories and playbooks on the menu:System Details[Ansible > Control Node] page.
As an inventory path, you can use the typical ansible inventory path [literal]``/etc/ansible/hosts``.
As a playbook directory, you can use any directory on the control node, where your playbooks reside.
A playbook directory either contains [literal]``.yml`` files or subdirectories with [literal]``.yml`` files.



[[at.ansible.inventory-inspection]]
== Inventory inspection

After defining an inventory path, you can use {productname} to inspect its contents.

.Procedure: Inspecting an inventory from the {webui}
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:System Details[Ansible > Inventories]
. Click an inventory path to execute the inventory inspection on the Control Node in real-time.



[[at.ansible.playbook-discovery]]
== Playbook discovery

After defining a playbook directory, you can discover playbooks on the menu:System Details[Ansible > Playbooks] page.

As with the inventory inspection, the playbook discovery operations run on the Control Node in real-time.



[[at.ansible.playbook-execution]]
== Playbook execution

You can schedule a playbook execution from the menu:System Details[Ansible > Playbooks] page.
After selecting the playbook you wish to execute, you can select the inventory file for the execution from the drop-down menu.
If you do not select any item, the default inventory configured in your Control Node will be used.
The drop-down menu is populated with the inventories you defined in your Inventory paths and with inventories that have been locally discovered in your playbook directories.
These are displayed as [guimenu]``Custom Inventory`` items in the playbook details.
You can also enter an arbitrary inventory path.

Afterwards, you choose the time of the playbook execution or select an action chain.
Eventually, {productname} executes the playbook as an action on the Control Node.
You can see the result of the operation on the action details page.
