[NOTE]
====
Currently, the supported version of Ansible is 2.9 (LTS) shipped in SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Client Tools channels.
Ansible software is also available for {productname} Proxy and {productname} {srm} Branch Server.
For Control Nodes running operating systems other than SUSE Linux Enterprise, use Ansible shipped together with your distribution.

[[at.ansible.overview]]
== Feature Overview

{productname} enables system administrators to operate their Ansible Control Nodes.
Supported features are:
* introspection of inventory files
* discovery of playbooks
* execution of playbooks



[[at.ansible.requirements]]
== Requirements

To use Ansible features, you need to register your Ansible Control Node system as a Salt client to your {productname} Server.
When registered, you must enable the ``Ansible Control Node`` system type in the [guimenu]``Add-on System Types`` on the menu:System Details[Properties] page of that system.

Enabling this system type ensures that the ``ansible`` package is installed on the system by adding it in the highstate and activates the Ansible features under the menu:System Details[Ansible] page.

As the next step, configure the paths to your Ansible inventories and playbooks on the menu:System Details[Ansible > Control Node] page.
As an inventory path, you can use the typical ansible inventory path [literal]``/etc/ansible/hosts``.
As a playbook directory, you can use any directory on the control node, where your playbooks reside.
A playbook directory either directly contains the [literal]``site.yml`` or contains subdirectories with this file.



[[at.ansible.inventory-introspection]]
== Inventory introspection

After defining an inventory path, you can use {productname} to introspect its contents.
You can do so on the menu:System Details[Ansible > Inventories] page.
Clicking an inventory path in this page executes the inventory introspection on the Control Node in real-time.



[[at.ansible.playbook-discovery]]
== Playbook discovery

After defining a playbook directory, you can discover playbooks on the menu:System Details[Ansible > Playbooks] page.

As with the inventory introspection, the playbook discovery operations run on the Control Node in real-time.



[[at.ansible.playbook-execution]]
== Playbook execution

You can schedule a playbook execution from the menu:System Details[Ansible > Playbooks] page.
After selecting the playbook you wish to execute, you can select the inventory file for the execution from the drop-down menu.
If you do not select any item, the default inventory configured in your Control Node will be used.
The drop-down menu is populated with the inventories you defined in your Inventory paths and with inventories that have been locally discovered in your playbook directories.
These are displayed as [guimenu]``Custom Inventory`` items in the playbook details.
You can also enter an arbitrary inventory path.

Afterwards, you choose the time of the playbook execution or select an action chain.
Eventually, {productname} executes the playbook as an action on the Control Node.
You can see the result of the operation on the action details page.
