Ansible is a tool to manage computer client systems.
For more information, see https://www.ansible.com.

{productname} supports managing Ansible control nodes.
For more information, see xref:administration:ansible-setup-control-node.adoc#at.ansible.overview[].

The supported version for the Ansible Control Node is Ansible 11.3.
It should be obtained from the operating system vendor's official repositories.
For example, on {sle} 15 SP6 and SP7, Ansible is available through the [literal]``Systems Management Module.``
For Control Nodes running operating systems other than {sle}, use Ansible shipped together with that distribution.

Ansible software is also available for {productname} Proxy and {productname} {smr} Branch Server.



[[at.ansible.overview]]
== Feature Overview


{productname} enables system administrators to operate their Ansible Control Nodes.
Supported features are:

* inspection of inventory files
* discovery of playbooks
* execution of playbooks

For more information:

* The inventory is a sorted list of managed Ansible nodes.  For more information about organizing an inventory, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html.
* Playbooks are a way to describe how the inventory is to be managed.  For more information about playbooks, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html.



[[at.ansible.requirements]]
== Requirements and Basic Configuration

To use Ansible features, you need to register the already existing Ansible Control Node to the {productname} Server.
In the {webui}, on the menu:System Details[Properties] page of the registered system, you must enable the ``Ansible Control Node`` system type of the [guimenu]``Add-on System Types`` list.

// FIXME: check it!
Enabling the ``Ansible Control Node`` system type ensures that the [package]``ansible`` package is installed on the system by adding it in the highstate and activates the Ansible features under the menu:System Details[Ansible] tab.

As the next step, configure the paths to your Ansible playbook directories and inventory files on the menu:System Details[Ansible > Control Node] page.
As an inventory path, you can use the standard Ansible inventory path [literal]``/etc/ansible/hosts``.
As a playbook directory, you can use any directory on the control node, where your playbook files are stored.
A playbook directory either contains [literal]``.yml`` files or subdirectories with [literal]``.yml`` files.

For installing and setting up an Ansible Control Node, see xref:administration:ansible-setup-control-node.adoc[].



[[at.ansible.inventory-inspection]]
== Inventory Inspection

After defining an inventory path, you can use {productname} to inspect its contents.

.Procedure: Inspecting an Inventory from the {webui}
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:System Details[Ansible > Inventories]
. Click an inventory path to execute the inventory inspection on the Control Node in real-time.



[[at.ansible.playbook-discovery]]
== Playbook Discovery

After defining a playbook directory, you can discover playbooks on the menu:System Details[Ansible > Playbooks] page.

As with the inventory inspection, the playbook discovery operations run on the Control Node in real-time.



[[at.ansible.playbook-execution]]
== Playbook Execution

You can schedule a playbook execution from the menu:System Details[Ansible > Playbooks] page.
After selecting the playbook you wish to execute, you can select the inventory file for the execution from the [guimenu]``Inventory Path`` drop-down menu of the [guimenu]``Schedule Playbook Execution`` dialog.
If you do not select any item, the default inventory configured in your Control Node will be used.
The drop-down menu is populated with the inventories you defined in your Inventory paths and with inventories that have been locally discovered in your playbook directories.
These are displayed as [guimenu]``Custom Inventory`` items in the playbook details.
You can also enter an arbitrary inventory path.

Afterwards, you choose the time of the playbook execution or select an action chain.
Eventually, {productname} executes the playbook as an action on the Control Node.
You can see the result of the operation on the action details page.
