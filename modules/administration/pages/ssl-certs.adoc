= SSL Certificates

{productname} uses SSL certificates to ensure that clients are registered to the correct server.

Every client that uses SSL to register to the {productname} Server checks that it is connecting to the right server by validating against a server certificate.
This process is called an SSL handshake.

During the SSL handshake, the client checks that the hostname in the server certificate matches what it expects.
The client also needs to check if the server certificate is trusted.

//Every {productname} Server that uses SSL requires an SSL server certificate.
//Provide the path to the server certificate using the ``SERVER_CERT`` environment variable during setup, or with the ``--from-server-cert`` option of the [command]``rhn-ssl-tool`` command.

Certificate authorities (CAs) are certificates that are used to sign other certificates.
All certificates must be signed by a certificate authority (CA) in order for them to be considered valid, and for clients to be able to successfully match against them.

//When an organization signs its own certificate, the certificate is considered self-signed.
//A self-signed certificate is straight-forward to set up, and does not cost any money, but they are considered less secure.
//If you are using a self-signed certificate, you have a root CA that is signed with itself.
//When you look at the details of a root CA, you can see that the subject has the same value as the issuer.
//Provide the path to your root CA certificate using the ``CA_CERT`` environment variable during setup, or with the ``--ca-cert`` option of the [command]``rhn-ssl-tool`` command.

In order for SSL authentication to work correctly, the client must trust the root CA.
This means that the root CA must be installed on every client.

The default method of SSL authentication is for {productname} to use self-signed certificates.
In this case, {productname} has generated all the certificates, and the root CA has signed the server certificate directly.

An alternative method is to use an intermediate CA.
In this case, the root CA signs the intermediate CA.
The intermediate CA can then sign any number of other intermediate CAs, and the final one signs the server certificate.
This is referred to as a chained certificate.

If you are using intermediate CAs in a chained certificate, the root CA is installed on the client, and the server certificate is installed on the server.
During the SSL handshake, clients must be able to verify the entire chain of intermediate certificates between the root CA and the server certificate, so they must be able to access all the intermediate certificates.

There are two main ways of achieving this.
In older versions of {productname}, by default, all the intermediate CAs are installed on the client.
However, you could also configure your services on the server to provide them to the client.
In this case, during the SSL handshake, the server presents the server certificate as well as all the intermediate CAs.
This mechanism is used now as the default configuration.

//Whichever method you choose, you must ensure that the ``CA_CERT`` environment variable points to the root CA, and all intermediate CAs.
//It should not contain the server certificate.
//The server certificate must be defined at the ``SERVER_CERT`` environment variable.

By default, {productname} uses a self-signed certificate without intermediate CAs.
For additional security, you can arrange a third party CA to sign your certificates.
Third party CAs perform checks to ensure that the information contained in the certificate is correct.
They usually charge an annual fee for this service.
Using a third party CA makes certificates harder to spoof, and provides additional protection for your installation.
If you have certificates signed by a third party CA, you can import them to your {productname} installation.

This manual describe the use of SSL certificates in two steps:

1. How to create a self-signed certificate with {productname} tools
2. How to deploy a certificate on {productname} Server or Proxy

In case the certificates are provided by a third party instance like an own or external PKI, step 1 can be skipped.

== Providing SSL certificates to the {productname} containers

=== Podman

SSL certificates are stored as podman secrets and assigned to respective containers. Podman SSL secrets are:

* CA certificates
  - uyuni-ca
  - uyuni-db-ca
* Server certificate and key
  - uyuni-cert
  - uyuni-key
* Database certificate and key
  - uyuni-db-cert
  - uyuni-db-key
