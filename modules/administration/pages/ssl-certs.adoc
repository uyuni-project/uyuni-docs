= SSL Certificates

{productname} uses SSL certificates to ensure that clients are registered to the correct server.

When you create an SSL certificate for your server, the certificate includes the host name of the server it is associated with.
The certificate is then deployed on the server, and when clients attempt to connect, they check the certificate details.
If the certificate contains the name of the server they are attempting to connect to, the connection will be successful.
The client will also check if the certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority.

All certificates must be signed by a certificate authority (CA), in order for them to be considered valid, and for clients to be able to successfully match against them.
When an organization signs its own certificate, the certificate is considered self-signed.
A self-signed certificate is straight-forward to set up, and does not cost any money, but they are considered less secure.

For additional security, you can arrange a third party CA to sign your certificates.
Third party CAs perform checks to ensure that the information contained in the certificate is correct.
They will usually charge an annual fee for this service.
Using a third party CA makes certificates harder to spoof, and will provide additional protection for your installation.

By default, {productname} uses a self-signed certificate.
If you have certificates signed by a third party CA, you can import them to your {productname} installation.

Every {productname} Server that uses SSL requires an SSL server certificate.
Your server certificate is stored using the ``SERVER_CERT`` environment variable.

Every client that uses SSL to register to the {productname} Server checks that it is connecting to the right server by validating against the server certificate.
This process is called an SSL handshake.

During the SSL handshake, the client will check that the hostname in the server certificate matches.
The client also needs to check if the server certificate is trusted.
To do this, it looks for the issuer of the server certificate.

Certificate authorities (CAs) are certificates that are used to sign other certificates.
The root CA is a special kind of CA that is signed with itself.
When you look at the details of a root CA, you will see that the subject has the same value as the issuer.
Your root CA certificate is stored using the ``CA_CERT`` environment variable.

In order for SSL authentication to work correctly, the client must trust the root CA.
This means that the root CA must be installed on every client.

The default method of SSL authentication is for {productname} to use self-signed certificates.
In this case, {productname} has generated all the certificates, and the root CA has signed the server certificate directly.

An alternative method is to use an intermediate CA.
In this case, the intermediate CA signs the root CA.
The intermediate CA can then sign any number of other intermediate CAs, one of which can sign the server certificate.
This is referred to as a chained certificate.

If you are using intermediate CAs in a chained certificate, the root CA is installed on the client, and during the SSL handshake, the server presents the server certificate.
Your clients must be able to verify the entire chain of intermediate certificates between the root CA and the server certificate.
To do this, the client requires all the chained certificates.

There are two main ways of achieving this.
In {productname}, by default, all the intermediate CAs are installed on the client.
However, you could also install them on the server.
In this case, during the SSL handshake, the server presents the server certificate as well as all the intermediate CAs.

Whichever method you choose, you must ensure that the ``CA_CERT`` environment variable points to the root CA, and all intermediate CAs.
It should not contain the server certificate.
The server certificate must be defined at the ``SERVER_CERT`` environment variable.
