Because of a problem in the computed partition size value, the saltboot formula can sometimes fail when it is created on SLE{nbsp}11 SP3 clients, with an error like this:

----
          ID: disk1_partitioned
    Function: saltboot.partitioned
        Name: disk1
      Result: false
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

    'Problem encountered while parsing output from parted')
CommandExecutionError: Problem encountered while parsing output from parted

This problem can be resolved by manually configuring the size of the partition containing the operating system.
When the size is set correctly, formula creation will work as expected.


.Procedure: Manually Configuring the Partition Size in the Saltboot Formula

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and select the ``Hardware Type Group`` that contains the SLE{nbsp}11 SP3 client that is causing the error.
    In the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab, navigate to the [guimenu]``Saltboot`` subtab.
. Locate the partition that contains the operating system, and in the [guimenu]``Partition Size`` field, type the appropriate size (in MiB).
. Click btn:[Save Formula], and apply the highstate to save your changes.
