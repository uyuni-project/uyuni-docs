= Troubleshooting the Saltboot Formula

Because of a problem in the computed partition size value, the saltboot formula can sometimes fail when it is created on SLE{nbsp}11 SP3 clients, with an error like this:

----
          ID: disk1_partitioned
    Function: saltboot.partitioned
        Name: disk1
      Result: false
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

    'Problem encountered while parsing output from parted')
CommandExecutionError: Problem encountered while parsing output from parted
----

This problem can be resolved by manually configuring the size of the partition containing the operating system.
When the size is set correctly, formula creation works as expected.


.Procedure: Manually Configuring the Partition Size in the Saltboot Formula

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups] and select the ``Hardware Type Group`` that contains the SLE{nbsp}11 SP3 client that is causing the error.
    In the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab, navigate to the [guimenu]``Saltboot`` subtab.
. Locate the partition that contains the operating system, and in the [guimenu]``Partition Size`` field, type the appropriate size (in MiB).
. Click btn:[Save Formula], and apply the highstate to save your changes.
