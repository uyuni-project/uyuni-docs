= HTTP Strict Transport Security

HTTP Strict Transport Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[HSTS]) is a policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

{productname} allows enabling HSTS, to enable it for a {productname} Server:

.Procedure
1. Edit `/etc/apache2/conf.d/zz-spacewalk-www.conf`
2. Uncomment the line `# Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains"`
3. Restart Apache with `systemctl restart apache2`

To enable it for {productname} Proxies:

.Procedure
1. Edit `/etc/apache2/conf.d/spacewalk-proxy.conf`
2. Uncomment the line `# Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains"`
3. Restart Apache with `systemctl restart apache2`


[IMPORTANT] 
====
When HSTS is enabled while using the default SSL certificate generated by {productname} or a self-signed certificate, browsers will refuse to connect with HTTPS unless the CA used to sign such certificates is trusted by the browser.
If you are using the SSL certificate generated by {productname}, you can trust it by importing the file located at `http://<SERVER-HOSTNAME>/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT` to the browsers of all users.
