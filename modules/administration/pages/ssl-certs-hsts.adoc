HTTP Strict Transport Security (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security[HSTS]) is a policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

On {productname}, HSTS is enabled by default.
If you need to disable it on the server, follow this procedure:



.Procedure: Disabling HSTS on the server
[role=procedure]
_____
. On the server container host, as root, execute the following command to create a new configuration file with setting [literal]``max-age=0``:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -- \
  echo 'Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=0; includeSubDomains"' \
  > /etc/apache2/conf.d/zz-spacewalk-www-hsts.conf
----

. Restart Apache with:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -- systemctl restart apache2
----

If you need to disable it on the proxy, follow this procedure:

.Procedure: Disabling HSTS on the proxy
[role=procedure]
_____
. On the server container host, as root, execute the following command to create a new configuration file with setting [literal]``max-age=0``:

+

[source,shell]
----
echo 'Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=0; includeSubDomains' \
  > /etc/uyuni/custom-httpd.conf

[WARNING]
====
When naming the new config file [literal]``<filename>.conf``, make sure it is loaded at the right time.
For example, to override something defined in [literal]``spacewalk-www.conf`` the new file needs to be alphabetically after this file.
For more information about how Apache loads files, see https://httpd.apache.org/docs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When HSTS is enabled while using the default SSL certificate generated by {productname} or a self-signed certificate, browsers will refuse to connect with HTTPS unless the CA used to sign such certificates is trusted by the browser.
If you are using the SSL certificate generated by {productname}, you can trust it by importing the file located at `http://<SERVER-HOSTNAME>/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT` to the browsers of all users.
