[[space-management]]
= Managing Disk Space

Running out of disk space can have a severe impact on the {productname} database and file structure which, in some cases, is not recoverable.

{productname} monitors some directories for free disk space.
You can modify which directories are monitored, and the warnings that are created.
All settings are configured in the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file.

When the available space in one of the monitored directories falls below a warning threshold, a message is sent to the configured email address and a notification is shown at the top of the sign-in page.



== Monitored Directories

By default, {productname} monitors these directories:

* [path]``/var/lib/pgsql``
* [path]``/var/spacewalk``
* [path]``/var/cache``
* [path]``/srv``

You can change which directories are monitored with the [systemitem]``spacecheck_dirs`` parameter.
You can specify multiple directories by separating them with a space.

For example:

----
spacecheck_dirs = /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk /var/cache /srv
----



== Thresholds

By default, {productname} creates a warning when a monitored directory has less than 10% of total space available.
A critical alert is created when a monitored directory falls below 5% space available.

You can change these alert thresholds with the [systemitem]``spacecheck_free_alert`` and [systemitem]``spacecheck_free_critical`` parameters.

For example:

----
spacecheck_free_alert = 10
spacecheck_free_critical = 5
----



== Shut Down Services

By default, {productname} shuts down the spacewalk services when the critical alert threshold is reached.

You can change this behavior with the [systemitem]``spacecheck_shutdown`` parameter.
A value of ``true`` enables the shut down feature.
Any other value disables it.

For example:
----
spacecheck_shutdown = true
----



== Disable Space Checking

The space checking tool is enabled by default.
You can disable it entirely with these commands:

----
systemctl stop spacewalk-diskcheck.timer
systemctl disable spacewalk-diskcheck.timer
----

Disabling the [literal]``spacewalk-diskcheck.timer`` will stop periodic email alerts if the alert threshold is reached, but the warning notification will still appear at the top of the sign-in page.
