= {productname} with Azure

You can use {productname} Server and Proxy with the Microsoft Azure public cloud.
This section discusses what you will need for running {productname} in Azure, and how to set up your installation.


== Configure the Azure Cloud Instance

Use the ``SUSE Manager Server 4 BYOS`` image.
The image is a pre-built image created by {suse}.
It is based on JeoS, and SUSE Manager is pre-installed but not configured.
Configuring SUSE Manager has to be done manually with {yast}.

When you create your Azure virtual machine, choose something `like d8s_v3` with 8{nbsp}vCPUs and 32{nbsp}GB RAM.
////
* Up to 4 data disks
* Max IOPS 2400
* Temporary storage disk of 16{nbsp}GB.
Data on this disk will be destroyed after the guest has been switched off.
////

When you are setting up disk partitioning, we recommend:

* 30{nbsp}GB for the disk running the operating system
* Select `Standard HDD` for the storage account type

You will also require three additional data disks:

* Disk 0: 64{nbsp}GB on Premium SSD, mounted at [path]``/var/lib/pgsql``
* Disk 1: 512{nbsp}GB on Standard SSD, mounted at [path]``/var/spacewalk``
* Disk 2: 128{nbsp}GB on Standard SSD, mounted at [path]``/var/cache``

[NOTE]
====
Do not use LVM with Azure.
If you need more disk space, extend a disk in the Azure portal, then extend the file system with [command]``xfs_growfs``.
====

Partition the disks like this:

* [path]``/dev/sda``: 4Â partitions containing the OS
* [path]``/dev/sdb``: temporary storage disk, do not use
* [path]``/dev/sdc``: contains [path]``/var/lib/pgsql``
* [path]``/dev/sdd``: contains [path]``/var/spacewalk``
* [path]``/dev/sde``: contains [path]``/var/cache``

You can use these commands to create the disks:

----
for d in sdc sdd sde; do
  parted --script /dev/$d mklabel gpt mkpart primary xfs 0% 100%
  mkfs.xfs /dev/${d}1
done
mkdir /cachetmp
mount /dev/sde1 /cachetmp
cp -a /var/cache/* /cachetmp/
umount /cachetmp
echo "$(blkid /dev/sdc1|awk -F " " '{ print $2 }') /var/lib/pgsql xfs defaults,noatime 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
echo "$(blkid /dev/sdd1|awk -F " " '{ print $2 }') /var/spacewalk xfs defaults,noatime 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
echo "$(blkid /dev/sde1|awk -F " " '{ print $2 }') /var/cache     xfs defaults,noatime 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mkdir -p /var/spacewalk
mount /var/spacewalk
chown -R wwwrun:root /var/spacewalk
mount /var/lib/pgsql
chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql
mv /var/cache /var/cache.old
mkdir /var/cache
mount /var/cache
rm -r /var/cache.old

// REMARK: I guess you do this in your Azure instance
When you are setting up networking, we recommend that you create a separate private network, with the IP range `10.0.0.0/24`.
// REMARK: Where do you configure this?

Configure the {productname} Server to use the internal IP address `10.0.0.4`.
Ensure it is also accessible from outside the network with a fixed IP address.

Configure the firewall to only allow inbound traffic on ports `22`, `80`, and `443` to IP address `10.0.0.4`.
In this environment, if other servers are added to the network they cannot be reached from outside the network.

Outbound is open from the private network.
// REMARK: Was does this mean?
This should be restricted for other servers in this private network.

You will need to set the DNS zones in Azure before you can configure the {productname} Server.
For more information on setting DNS zones, see the Azure documentation.



== Configure {productname} Server

Ensure that your {productname} Server is registered with {scc}.

// I wonder why we do even need spacecmd
When your server is registered, install these extra packages:
----
zypper -n in spacecmd mlocate sysstat
----
// spacecmd will be installed by default next time
// ^ How is so?

Apply the latest updates and reboot the server:
----
zypper -n up -l
reboot
----

Check that all file systems are mounted and that PostgreSQL is running:
----
mount
service postgresql status
----

Complete {productname} Server installation and configuration.
For more information, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[].

We recommend you configure the {productname} Server so that DHCP does not set the host name.
Check [path]``/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp`` and ensure that `DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME` is set to [literal]``no``:
----
DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME="no"
----

Add the Azure client to the [path]``/etc/hosts`` file.
At the command prompt, replace [literal]``<ip_address>`` with the IP address of the server:
// REMARK: hostname -i?
----
echo "<ip_address> $(hostname -f) $(hostname)" >> /etc/hosts
----


{productname} Server has a default administration user.
In Azure, the system administrator user is called [literal]``admin``.
The `admin` user's password is built with two parts.
The first part can be found by using this command:
----
azuremetadata --instance-name
----

The second part of the password is [literal]``-suma``

Alternatively, you can check the [path]``/var/log/susemanager_firstuser.log`` file.


////

REMARK: Do we want to list the details here?  Or is such a general xref good enough?

For the SUSE Manager setup configuration in general, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[], _procedure "{productname} Setup"_.

Pay special attention to the following settings:

* In the first dialog, select [guimenu]``Set up SUSE Manager from scratch``
* In the next dialog, enter a valid mail address for the administrator
* It is very important to remember the password given for SSL.
Without this password no SUSE Manager Proxy Server can be installed and no other changes can be made to the certificate.
For example, this certificate is eg used on all registered systems to communicate with SUSE Manager Server.
* In the [guimenu]``Database Settings`` dialog, it is enough to provide a password.
Make sure also to remember this password.

With these settings the installation can be started.
The installation will finish without further input.
