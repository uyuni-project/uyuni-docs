== Action Chains

If you need to perform a number of sequential actions on your clients, you can create an action chain to automate them.
You can use action chains on both traditional and Salt clients.

Action chains can include any number of these actions, in any order:

* menu:System Details[Remote Command]
* menu:System Details[Schedule System Reboot]
* menu:System Details[States > Highstate]
* menu:System Details[Software > Packages > List/Remove]
* menu:System Details[Software > Packages > Install]
* menu:System Details[Software > Packages > Upgrade]
* menu:System Details[Software > Patches]
* menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels]
* menu:System Details[Configuration]
* menu:Images[Build]



.Procedure: Creating a New Action Chain
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to the first action you want to perform in the action chain.
For example, navigate to [guimenu]``System Details`` for a client, and click btn:[Schedule System Reboot].
. Check the [guimenu]``Add to`` field and select ``new action chain``.
. Confirm the action.
This will not perform the action immediately, it will instead create the new action chain, and a blue bar confirming this appears at the top of the screen.
. Continue adding actions to your action chain by checking the [guimenu]``Add to`` field and selecting the name of the action chain to add them to.
. When you have finished adding actions, navigate to menu:Schedule[Action Chains] and selecting the action chain from the list.
. Re-order actions by dragging them and dropping them into the correct position.
Click the blue plus sign to see the clients an action will be performed on.
Click btn:[Save] to save your changes.
. Schedule a time for your action chain to run, and click btn:[Save and Schedule].
If you leave the page without clicking either btn:[Save] or btn:[Save and Schedule] all unsaved changes will be discarded.

[NOTE]
====
If one action in an action chain fails, the action chain stops, and no further actions are executed.

You can see scheduled actions from action chains by navigating to menu:Schedule[Pending Actions].
