= Confidential Computing

{CoCo} is a technology which allows protection of data in use by using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), the type of environments that provide increased level of security for data integrity, data confidentiality, and code integrity.


== {CoCo} with {productname}

The trustworthiness of the TEE is checked with the attestation process.
{productname} can be used as an attestation server for the systems registered to it.
It generates a report page for the systems which run in this mode.
These systems need to be attested and checked on regular base.
The history of the past checks is also stored and available per request.

{CoCo} Attestation depends on the used hardware and environment where the attested systems are running on.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{CoCo} Attestation is only available on x86_64 architecture.
====



== Requirements

{CoCo} can be set up in an environment with the following characteristics:

* Attested system (virtual machine) is SLES15 SP6 and bootstrapped to {productname}
* Hardware must have [literal]``AMD EPYC Milan CPU`` or [literal]``AMD EPYC Genoa CPU``
* BIOS must be configured to allow {CoCo} attestation
* Host OS and the virtualization software (KVM and libvirt) must support {CoCo}.


== Limitations

* SLES15 SP6 has {CoCo} attestation as technology preview.
* {productname} has {CoCo} attestation as technology preview.
* Secure boot is attested. 
  However, currently KVM secure boot and SNP Guest are not working together. 


== Use {CoCo} in {productname}

[IMPORTANT]
====
For the exact steps for setting up and configuring {CoCo} on your host, refer to the OS Vendor documentation.

.Procedure: Enabling Attestation Container During the {productname} Installation
[role=procedure]
. The attestation container is enabled during the installation of {productname} with [literal]``mgradm install podman``.
. Add the following to file [literal]``mgradm.yaml``.
//I need full path to this file.
+
----
coco:
    replicas: 1
----


.Procedure: Enabling Attestation Container After the {productname} Installation
[role=procedure]
. To enable the attestation container after the installation, use the command line parameter [literal]``mgradm``.
. Run the command
+
----
mgradm scale --coco-replicas 1
----
// (PLACEHOLDER): In the future instead of number 1, it should be possible to allow more then one container replica.


.Procedure: Enabling Attestation Container After the {productname} Installation
[role=procedure]
. To disable the already enabled attestation container, run the command:
+
----
mgradm scale --coco-replicas 0
----


.Procedure: Enabling Attestation
[role=procedure]
. For the selected system, go to tab menu:Audit[Confidential Computing > Settings].
. Enable the attestation by selecting the toggle button.
. In the field [literal]``Environment Type`` select the correct option from the drop-down list.
//. (PLACEHOLDER) Enable the automatic attestaion at reboot by selecting the toggle button [literal]``Execution``.
. Click button btn:[Save] to save the changes.

.Procedure: Scheduling New Attestation
[role=procedure]
. For the selected system, go to tab menu:Audit[Confidential Computing > List Attestations].
. Click btn:[Schedule Attestation].
  The new form opens.
. In the field [literal]``Earliest`` select the time of running the attestation.
. If needed, add the newly created attestation to the action chain by selecting [literal]``Add to`` option.
. Click button btn:[Schedule] to save and schedule the new attestation execution.

=== Report Statuses

Attestation reports can have one of the following statuses:

Pending::
This is the default status of the scheduled attestation.
The report is still not available, either because the process has not yet started or completed.

Successful::
When the scheduled attestation creates a report which can be viewed, the status of the process is [literal]``Successful``.

Failed::
When the scheduled fails and does not create a report as a result, the status of the process is [literal]``Failed``.
