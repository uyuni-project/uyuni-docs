= Troubleshooting Disk Space

Running out of disk space can have a severe impact on the {productname} database and file structure which, in most cases, is not recoverable.
{productname} monitors free space in specific directories, and has configurable alerts.
For more on space management, see xref:administration:space-management.adoc[].

You can recover disk space by removing unused software channels.
For instructions on how to delete vendor channels, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].
For instructions on how to delete custom channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].

You can also recover disk space by cleaning up unused activation keys, content lifecycle projects, and client registrations.
You can also remove redundant database entries:



.Procedure: Resolving Redundant Database Entries
. Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck`` command to list any redundant database entries.
. Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck --remove`` command to delete them.
