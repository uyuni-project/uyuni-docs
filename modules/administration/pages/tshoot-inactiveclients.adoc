A Taskomatic job periodically pings clients to ensure they are connected.
Clients are considered inactive if they have not responded to a Taskomatic check in for 24 hours or more.
To see a list of inactive clients in the {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List > Inactive].

Clients can become inactive for a number of reasons:

* The client is not entitled to any {productname} service.
    If the client remains unentitled for 180 days (6 months), it is removed.
* On traditional clients, the [clientitem]``rhnsd`` service has been disabled.
* The client is behind a firewall that does not allow HTTPS connections.
* The client is behind a proxy that is misconfigured.
* The client is communicating with a different {productname} Server, or the connection has been misconfigured.
* The client is not in a network that can communicate with the {productname} Server.
* A firewall is blocking traffic between the client and the {productname} Server.
* Taskomatic is misconfigured.
