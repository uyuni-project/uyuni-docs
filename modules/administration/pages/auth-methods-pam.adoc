= Authentication With PAM

{productname} supports network-based authentication systems using pluggable authentication modules (PAM) using SSSD.
PAM is a suite of libraries that allows you to integrate {productname} with a centralized authentication mechanism, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords.
{productname} supports LDAP, Kerberos, and other network-based authentication protocols.


== SSSD Configuration

.Procedure: Configuring SSSD
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Users[Create User] and enable a new or existing user to authenticate with PAM.
+
[NOTE]
====
In usernames, additionally to alphanumeric characters, [literal]``-``, [literal]``_``, [literal]``.``, and [literal]``@`` are allowed.
====
. Check the [guimenu]``Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)`` checkbox.
. Configure SSSD in the server container.
  At the command prompt of the {productname} container host, as root, enter the server container:
+

----
mgrctl term
----

. Inside the container, execute the following steps:
+

.. To set configuration options, open the file:
+
----
/etc/sssd/sssd.conf
----
+
.. Set [literal]``krb5_keytab`` in ``domain/$domain`` to [literal]``/etc/sssd/krb5.keytab``
.. Exit the container:
+
----
exit
----
. Restart {productname} using:
+
----
mgradm restart
----



[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the password in the {productname} {webui} changes only the local password on the {productname} Server.
If PAM is enabled for that user, the local password might not be used at all.
In the above example, for instance, the Kerberos password is not changed.
Use the password change mechanism of your network service to change the password for these users.

For more information about PAM configuration, see the {sles} Security Guide. The Security Guide contains a generic example that also works for other network-based authentication methods.
It also describes how to configure an Active Directory (AD) service.
For more information, see {sles-base-os-documentation}/part-auth.html.



=== LDAP Integration with Active Directory Example

For LDAP integration with Active Directory, you can use the following example.

In the code snippet, change the following placeholders according to your environment:

[literal]``$domain``::
Your domain name
[literal]``$ad_server``::
FQDN of the AD server if it is not auto-detected from the [literal]``$domain``
[literal]``$uyuni-hostname``:
The name of the machine this AD client is supposed to be known.
If not set, it will be [literal]``uyuni-server.mgr.internal``.


Example snippet for [path]``/etc/sssd/sssd.conf``:

----
[sssd]
config_file_version = 2
services = nss, pam
domains = $domain

[nss]

[pam]

[domain/$domain]
id_provider = ad
chpass_provider = ad
access_provider = ad
auth_provider = ad

ad_domain = $domain
ad_server = $ad_server
ad_hostname = $uyuni-hostname

ad_gpo_map_network = +susemanager

krb5_keytab = FILE:/etc/rhn/krb5.conf.d/krb5.keytab
krb5_ccname_template = FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_%{uid}
