= Authentication With PAM

{productname} supports network-based authentication systems using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) using SSSD.
PAM is a suite of libraries that allows you to integrate {productname} with a centralized authentication mechanism, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords.

{productname} supports LDAP, Kerberos, and other network-based authentication protocols.


== SSSD Configuration

[WARNING]
====
* Do not edit [path]``/etc/krb5.conf``.
* Custom configuration needs to be saved in the [path]``/etc/rhn/krb5.conf.d`` directory.
====


.Procedure: Configuring SSSD
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Users[Create User] and enable a new or existing user to authenticate with PAM.
+
[NOTE]
====
In usernames, additionally to alphanumeric characters, [literal]``-``, [literal]``_``, [literal]``.``, and [literal]``@`` are also allowed.
====
. Check the [guimenu]``Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)`` checkbox.
. Configure SSSD in the container.
  Connect inside the container using:
+
----
mgrctl term
----
Then change the file
+
----
/etc/sssd/sssd.conf
----
. Restart {productname} using:
+
----
mgradm restart
----



[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the password in the {productname} {webui} changes only the local password on the {productname} Server.
If PAM is enabled for that user, the local password might not be used at all.

In the above example, for example, the Kerberos password is not changed.
Use the password change mechanism of your network service to change the password for these users.

*SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Security Guide* contains a generic example that also works for other network-based authentication methods.
It also describes how to configure an active directory service.
