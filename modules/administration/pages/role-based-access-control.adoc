= Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security method that restricts resources access to authorized users based on their assigned roles. In {productname}, RBAC ensures that users can only perform actions and access resources for which they have explicit authorization, enhancing security and simplifying administration.

The core principles of RBAC include:

* *Principle of Least Privilege:* Granting only the necessary access rights for users to perform their tasks.
* *Granular Control:* Providing fine-grained control over specific functionalities.
* *Separation of Duties:* Preventing a single user from having too much control over critical processes.
* *Auditability:* Allowing for clear tracking of user actions and permissions.


[[rbac-key-concepts]]
== Key RBAC Concepts

Understanding the following core concepts is crucial for effective RBAC management:

* *Role:* A collection of permissions defining a specific set of capabilities within {productname}. Roles are assigned to users, granting the user aggregated permissions.
* *Permission:* An atomic authorization to perform a specific action, access a specific web page or call a specific API endpoint within {productname}. In {productname}, permissions are represented by namespaces and their access modes.
* *User:* An individual account that interacts with {productname}. Users are assigned one or more roles.
* *Namespace:* A granular unit of access control organized in a tree-like structure. Most namespaces have distinct "View" or "Modify" modes.


[[user-roles]]
== User Roles in {productname}

{productname} provides predefined roles and allows for the definition of additional custom roles, optionally inheriting from a combination of other roles.


=== Predefined Roles

Refer to xref:administration:users.adoc#administrator-roles[] for a complete list of predefined roles and their descriptions.


=== Defining Additional Roles

To define additional roles, you can:

* Select a number of existing roles to inherit permissions from.
* Specify additional namespaces to grant access to.


[[namespaces-fine-grained-access]]
== Namespaces for Fine-Grained Access

Namespaces provide fine-grained access control, organized in a tree-like structure. For most namespaces, access within a namespace is further granularized by "View" and "Modify" modes.

.Example: Image Management namespaces and access modes
[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Namespace             | Access Mode   | Description
| ``cm.build``          | Modify        | Build container or Kiwi images
| ``cm.image.import``   | Modify        | Import container images from a registered image store
| ``cm.image.list``     | View          | List all images
| ``cm.image.list``     | Modify        | Delete images
| ``cm.image.overview`` | View          | View image details, patches, packages, build log and cluster information
| ``cm.image.overview`` | Modify        | Inspect, rebuild, delete images
| ``cm.profile.details``| View          | View details of an image profile
| ``cm.profile.details``| Modify        | Create image profiles, edit profile details
| ``cm.profile.list``   | View          | List all image profiles
| ``cm.profile.list``   | Modify        | Delete image profiles
| ``cm.store.details``  | View          | View details of an image store
| ``cm.store.details``  | Modify        | Create image stores, edit store details
| ``cm.store.list``     | View          | List all image stores
| ``cm.store.list``     | Modify        | Delete image stores

A comprehensive list of namespaces and their descriptions can be retrieved by making a call to the ``access.listNamespaces`` API method.
Refer to {productname} API documentation for detailed information, including request and response formats.


[[managing-rbac]]
== Managing RBAC

Managing RBAC roles and permissions is currently only possible through the API.
To assign roles to users via the web UI, refer to xref:administration:users.adoc[].


=== Managing RBAC via API

The {productname} API provides methods for programmaticaly managing roles, permissions and user assignments.


==== The ``access`` API

These API methods manage roles and their associated access:

* ``listNamespaces``: Lists available namespaces, access modes and their descriptions in {productname}.
* ``listPermissions``: Lists permitted namespaces of a role.
* ``listRoles``: Lists existing roles in {productname}.
* ``createRole``: Creates a new role, optionally copying permissions from existing roles.
* ``deleteRole``: Deletes a role.
* ``grantAccess``: Grants access to namespaces.
* ``revokeAccess``: Revokes access to namespaces.


==== The ``user`` API

These API methods manage user-role assignments:

* ``listPermissions``: Lists effective permissions of a user.
* ``listRoles``: Lists a user's assigned roles.
* ``addRole``: Assigns a role to a user.
* ``removeRole``: Removes a role from a user.

For detailed API documentation, including request and response formats, refer to {productname} API reference.


[[rbac-best-practices]]
== RBAC Best Practices

Adhering to these best practices will help maintain a secure, efficient, and manageable RBAC environment:

* *Principle of least privilege:* Always grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their duties. Avoid overly broad permissions.
* *Regular review:* Periodically review assigned roles and permissions for users to ensure they are still appropriate and comply with current security policies.
* *Document roles:* Clearly document the purpose and permissions of each custom role you create.
* *Separate duties:* Implement roles that enforce separation of duties to prevent a single user from having too much control over critical processes.
