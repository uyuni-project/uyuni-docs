= Inter-Server Synchronization

//If you have more than one {productname} installation, you will need to copy contents between servers.
//Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) allows you to export data from one server (source) and import it on another (target) server.
//This is useful for hub deployment scenarios or disconnected setups.
Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) allows transfer of data such as software channels and configuration channels from one {productname} server to another.

Each server can take on any of the existing roles which are distinguished based on the direction of the data transfer.
The main server is the one the data is transferred from, and is referred to as hub server.
The server the data is transferred to is referred to as peripheral server.

Once the connection between hub and peripheral servers is established, the hub server becomes the main source of data for the peripheral server, effectively replacing {scclongform}.

The main characteristics of this feature are:

* There can only be one hub server per communication / link, and one or more peripheral servers.

* One peripheral server can be linked to one hub serevr only. 

* Content can be synchronized on regular basis, or on demand.

{productname} supports two types of Inter-Server Synchronization: xref:administration:iss_v2.adoc[] and xref:administration:iss_v3.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
With the version 2 ISS implementation {suse} removed the master/slave notion.
Contents can be exported and imported in any direction between any {productname} server.
