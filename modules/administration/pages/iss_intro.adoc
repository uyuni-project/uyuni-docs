If you have more than one {productname} installation, you will need to copy contents between servers.
Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) allows you to export data from one server (source) and import it on another (target) server.
This is useful for hub deployment scenarios or disconnected setups.



[NOTE]
====
With the version 2 ISS implementation {suse} removed the master/slave notion.
Contents can be exported and imported in any direction between any {productname} server.
