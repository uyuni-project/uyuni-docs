= Troubleshooting Autoinstallation

Depending on your base channel, new autoinstallation profiles might be subscribed to a channel that is missing required packages.

For autoinstallation to work, these packages are required:

* [package]``pyOpenSSL``
* [package]``rhnlib``
* [package]``libxml2-python``
* [package]``spacewalk-koan``

To resolve this issue, check these things first:

* Check that the tools software channel related to the base channel in your autoinstallation profile is available to your organization and your user.
* Check that the tools channel is available to your {productname} as a child channel.
* Check that the required packages and any dependencies are available in the associated channels.
