= Troubleshooting Autoinstallation

If you use the obsolete plain {salt} (salt-minion) implementation for communication, you on your own must make sure that all the needed software (software packages) is properly available in configured client channels.

With the default {salt} bundle (venv-salt-minion) implementation you only need a client tools channel as a child channel that is compatible with your client base channel.
All required packages will be part of the {salt} bundle.

* Check that the client tools software channel related to the base channel in your autoinstallation profile is available to your organization and your user.
* Check that the tools channel is available to your {productname} as a child channel.
* Only if using the obsolete plain {salt} (salt-minion) implementation, also check that the required packages and any dependencies are available in the associated channels.
