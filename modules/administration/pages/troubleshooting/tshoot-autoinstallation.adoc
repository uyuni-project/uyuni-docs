= Troubleshooting Autoinstallation

If you use the plain {salt} (salt-minion) implementation for communication, you on your own must make sure that all the needed software (software packages) is properly available in configured client channels.
It is not recommended to use this implementation together with {productname}.

With the default {salt} bundle (venv-salt-minion) implementation you only need a client tools channel as a child channel that is compatible with your client base channel.
All required packages will be part of the {salt} bundle.

* Check that the client tools software channel related to the base channel in your autoinstallation profile is available to your organization and your user.
* Check that the tools channel is available to your {productname} as a child channel.
* Only if using the plain {salt} (salt-minion) implementation, also check that the required packages and any dependencies are available in the associated channels.
