If you are using {productname} to manage virtual machines, you might find it useful to create clones of your VMs.
A clone is a VM that uses a primary disk that is an exact copy of an existing disk.

While cloning VMs can save you a lot of time, the duplicated identifying information on the disk can sometimes cause problems.

If you try to register two machine where one is the clone of the other, you probably want {productname} to register them as two separate clients.
However, if the machine ID in both the original client and the clone is the same, {productname} registers both clients as one system, and the data is overwritten one the second machine is registered.

This can be resolved by changing the machine ID of the clone, so that {productname} recognizes them as two different clients.
For more information and instructions on how to change machine ID, see xref:administration:troubleshooting/tshoot-registerclones.adoc[].

However, in some situations, it is neither feasible nor practical to change the machine ID on all systems, as this could disrupt other applications that depend on the existing machine IDs. In those cases, a option is available where a fake machine ID is generated to be used in the context of {productname}.

.Procedure: Generating machine ID for {productname} at registration time
[role=procedure]
____

. Create a Bootstrap script (skip this step if you already have it)
  For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].

. Open the file and change the parameter:

+

----
GENERATE_OWN_MACHINEID=1
----

. Start using your bootstrap strict, and machine ID will not collide anymore
