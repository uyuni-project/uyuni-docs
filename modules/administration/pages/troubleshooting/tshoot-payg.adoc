Checking the credentials::
* If the script fails to collect the credentials, it should provide a proper error message in the logs and in the {webui}.
* If the credentials are not working, [literal]``reposync`` should show the proper error.

Using [literal]``registercloudguest``::
* Refreshing or changing the [literal]``registercloudguest`` connection to the public cloud update infrastructure should not interfere with the credentials usage.
* Running [literal]```registercloudguest --clean`` will cause problems if no new cloud connection is registered with the cloud guest command.
