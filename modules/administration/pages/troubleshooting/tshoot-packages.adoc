When packages on a client are locked, {productname} Server may not be able to correctly determine the set of applicable patches.
When this occurs, package updates are available in the {webui}, but do not appear on the client, and attempts to update the client fail.
Check package locks and exclude lists to determine if packages are locked or excluded on the client.

On the client, check package locks and exclude lists to determine if packages are locked or excluded:

* On an Expanded Support Platform, check [path]``/etc/yum.conf`` and search for ``exclude=``.
* On {sle} and {opensuse}, use the [command]``zypper locks`` command.
