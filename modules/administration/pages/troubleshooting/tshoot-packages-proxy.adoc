In some occasions the [systemitem]``squid`` cache on the proxy gets corrupted.
When this occurs getting packages or repositories metadata on a client connected to the proxy fails with various possible error messages.

Cleaning the [systemitem]``squid`` cache is done differently on a regular or a container proxy.

For a regular proxy, follow this procedure on the proxy machine:

----
systemctl stop squid
rm -rf /var/cache/squid
systemctl start squid
----

For a container proxy running with [systemitem]``podman``, follow this procedure on the host machine:

----
systemctl stop uyuni-proxy-pod
podman volume rm uyuni-proxy-squid-cache
systemctl start uyuni-proxy-pod
----
