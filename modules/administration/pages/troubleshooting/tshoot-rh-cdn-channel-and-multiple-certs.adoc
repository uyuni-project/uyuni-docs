= Troubleshooting Red Hat CDN Channel and Multiple Certificates

The {redhat} content delivery network (CDN) channels sometimes provide multiple certificates, but the {productname} {webui} can only import a single certificate.
If CDN presents a certificate that is different to the one the {productname} {webui} knows about, validation fails and permission to access the repository is denied, even though the certificate is accurate.
The error message received is:

----
[error]
Repository '<repo_name>' is invalid.
<repo.pem> Valid metadata not found at specified URL
History:
 - [|] Error trying to read from '<repo.pem>'
 - Permission to access '<repo.pem>' denied.
Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.
Skipping repository '<repo_nam' because of the above error.
Could not refresh the repositories because of errors.
HH:MM:SS RepoMDError: Cannot access repository. Maybe repository GPG keys are not imported
----

To resolve this issue, merge all valid certificates into a single ``.pem`` file, and rebuild the certificates for use by {productname}:



.Procedure: Resolving Multiple {redhat} CDN Certificates
. On the {redhat} client, at the command prompt, as root, gather all current certificates from ``/etc/pki/entitlement/`` in a single ``rh-cert.pem`` file:
+
----
cat 866705146090697087.pem 3539668047766796506.pem redhat-entitlement-authority.pem > rh-cert.pem
----
. Gather all current keys from ``/etc/pki/entitlement/`` in a single ``rh-key.pem`` file:
+
----
cat 866705146090697087-key.pem 3539668047766796506-key.pem > rh-key.pem
----

You can now import the new certificates to the {productname} Server, using the instructions in xref:client-configuration:clients-rh-cdn.adoc[].
