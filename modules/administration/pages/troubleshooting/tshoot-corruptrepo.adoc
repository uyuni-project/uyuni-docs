The information in the repository metadata files can become corrupt or out of date.
This can create problems with updating clients.
You can fix this by removing the files and regenerating it.
With an new repository data file, updates should operate as expected.

.Procedure: Resolving Corrupt Repository Data
. Remove all files from [path]``/var/cache/rhn/repodata/<channel-label>-updates-x86_64``.
    If you do not know the channel label, you can find it in the {productname} {webui}, by navigating to menu:Software[Channels > Channel Label].
. Regenerate the file from the command line:
