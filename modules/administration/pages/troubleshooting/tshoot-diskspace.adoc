Running out of disk space can have a severe impact on the {productname} database and file structure which, in most cases, is not recoverable.
{productname} monitors free space in specific directories, and has configurable alerts.
For more on space management, see xref:administration:space-management.adoc[].

Generally, container volumes share space with the host filesystem.
When the [systemitem]``btrfs`` filesystem becomes full, it can prevent you from deleting files.
To resolve this, you can add a small amount of storage temporarily to the filesystem using the [command]``btrfs device add`` command.
This will allow you to delete files to gain space for further filesystem maintenance.
When done with the maintenance, you can remove the temporary storage with [command]``btrfs device delete``.

You can recover disk space by removing unused software channels.

* For instructions on how to delete vendor channels, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].
* For instructions on how to delete custom channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].

You can also check how often your custom channels are synchronized.
For instructions on how deal with custom channel synchronization, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc#_custom_channel_synchronization[].

You can also recover disk space by cleaning up unused activation keys, content lifecycle projects, and client registrations.
You can also remove redundant database entries:



.Procedure: Resolving Redundant Database Entries
. Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck`` command to list any redundant database entries.
. Use the [command]``spacewalk-data-fsck --remove`` command to delete them.
