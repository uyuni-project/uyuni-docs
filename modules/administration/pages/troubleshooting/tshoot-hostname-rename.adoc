Cause: Renaming the hostname
Consequence: Changes not picked up by db, clients and proxies
Fix: Use the [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script to update the settings in the PostgreSQL database and the internal structures of {productname}.
Result: Renaming is successfully propagated
////

If you change the hostname of the {productname} Server locally, your {productname} installation ceases to work properly.
This is because the changes have not been made in the database, which prevents the changes from propagating out your clients and any proxies.



== Rename Server

If you need to change the hostname of the {productname} Server, you can do so using the [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script.
This script updates the settings in the {postgresql} database and the internal structures of {productname}.



=== Server Configuration

The [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script is part of the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package.

The only mandatory parameter for the script is the new fully qualified domain name of the {productname} Server.



.Procedure: Renaming {productname} Server
. Change the network settings of the server on the system level locally and remotely at the DNS server.
    You also need to provide configuration settings for reverse name resolution.
    Changing network settings is done in the same way as with renaming any other system.
. Reboot the {productname} Server to use the new network configuration and to ensure the hostname has changed.
. On the container host, from the command line, execute the following command to update the settings of the server:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-hostname-rename <NEW-FQDN>
----

+

Be aware that this script refreshes the pillar data for all {salt} clients: the time it takes to run depends on the number of registered clients.

In case third party SSL certificates are used on the {productname} server, the server certificate and key need to be recreated with the new FQDN.

.Procedure: Renaming {productname} Server with third party certificates
. Copy the root certification authority certificate, the new server certificate and key to the {productname} Server host.
. Copy them to a temporary folder in the container using [command]``mgrctl cp``.
. Run [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` with parameters to deploy the new certificate.

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec mkdir /tmp/ssl
mgrctl cp ca.crt server:/tmp/ssl/ca.crt
mgrctl cp srv.crt server:/tmp/ssl/srv.crt
mgrctl cp srv.key server:/tmp/ssl/srv.key
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-hostname-rename <NEW-FQDN> --ssl-ca-cert=/tmp/ssl/ca.crt --ssl-server-cert=/tmp/ssl/srv.crt and --ssl-server-key=/tmp/ssl/srv.key 
mgrctl exec rm -r /tmp/ssl

=== Directly Managed Clients Reconfiguration

*Skip this procedure if clients are managed via a {productname} proxy.*

With the following procedure, reconfigure directly managed clients to make them aware of the new hostname and IP address.

.Procedure: Reconfiguring Directly Managed Clients
. On the every client, in the {salt} client configuration file, specify the name of the new {salt} master ({productname} Server).
  The filename is [path]``/etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/susemanager.conf`` or, if you do not use the {salt} bundle, [path]``/etc/salt-minion/minion.d/susemanager.conf``:

+

----
master: <new_hostname>
----

. On every client, restart {salt} service.
  Either run:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl restart venv-salt-minion
----

+

Or, if you do not use the {salt} bundle, run:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----



=== Client Connection with Applying High State

Finally, to fully propagate the hostname to the {salt} client configuration, apply the high state.
Applying the high state will update the hostname in the repository URLs.



== Reconfigure Proxy

Every proxy must be reconfigured.
The new server certificate and key must be copied to the proxy.
For more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-proxy.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use PXE boot through a proxy, you must check the configuration settings of the proxy.
If you use PXE boot through non-containerized {productname} Proxy 4.3, [systemitem]``tftpsync`` needs to be reconfigured.

On the container host, execute:

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- configure-tftpsync.sh
----
