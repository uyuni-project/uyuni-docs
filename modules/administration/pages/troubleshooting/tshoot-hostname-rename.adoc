Cause: Renaming the hostname
Consequence: Changes not picked up by db, clients and proxies
Fix: Use the [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script to update the settings in the PostgreSQL database and the internal structures of {productname}.
Result: Renaming is successfully propagated

If you change the hostname of the {productname} Server locally, your {productname} installation ceases to work properly.
This is because the changes have not been made in the database, which prevents the changes from propagating out your clients and any proxies.

If you need to change the hostname of the {productname} Server, you can do so using the [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script.
This script updates the settings in the {postgresql} database and the internal structures of {productname}.

The [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script is part of the [package]``spacewalk-utils`` package.

The only mandatory parameter for the script is the newly configured IP address of the {productname} Server.



.Procedure: Renaming {productname} Server
. Change the network settings of the server on the system level locally and remotely at the DNS server.
    You also need to provide configuration settings for reverse name resolution.
    Changing network settings is done in the same way as with renaming any other system.
. Reboot the {productname} Server to use the new network configuration and to ensure the hostname has changed.
. Run the script [command]``spacewalk-hostname-rename`` script with the public IP address of the server.
    If the server is not using the new hostname, the script fails.
    Be aware that this script refreshes the pillar data for all {salt} clients: the time it takes to run depends on the number of registered clients.

. *Skip this step if the clients are managed via a {productname} proxy.*
  Re-configure the clients directly managed to make them aware of the new hostname and IP address.
  In the {salt} client configuration file, you must specify the name of the new {salt} master ({productname} Server) (the filename is [path]``/etc/venv-salt-bundle/minion``or, if you do not use the {salt} bundle, [path]``/etc/salt/minion``):
+
----
master: <new_hostname>
----

. Restart the [systemitem]``venv-salt-minion`` service (if using the {salt} bundle):
+
----
systemctl restart venv-salt-minion
----

+
Or  the [systemitem]``salt-minion``  service (if not using the {salt} bundle):
+
----
systemctl restart salt-minion
----

. To fully propagate the hostname to the {salt} client configuration apply the high state.
  Applying the high state will update the hostname in the repository URLs.



[IMPORTANT]
====
Any proxy must be reconfigured.
The new server certificate and key must be copied to the proxy and the
[command]``configure-proxy.sh`` script must be run.
For more information about configuring a proxy, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:proxy-setup.adoc[].
====

// FIXME: When backported, remove the following traditional client info
Directly connected traditional clients have the [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date`` configuration file that must be changed.
With a re-activation key you can re-register traditional clients (if there are any).
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-cli.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
If you use PXE boot through a proxy, you must check the configuration settings of the proxy.
On the proxy, run the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` setup script and enter the requested information.
For more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:proxy-setup.adoc[].
