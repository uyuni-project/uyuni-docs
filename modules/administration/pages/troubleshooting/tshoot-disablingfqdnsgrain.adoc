= Troubleshooting Disabling the FQDNS grain

The FQDNS grain returns the list of all the fully qualified DNS services in the system.
Collecting this information is usually a fast process, but if the DNS settings have been misconfigured, it could take a much longer time.
In some cases, the client could become unresponsive, or crash.

To prevent this problem, you can disable the FQDNS grain with a Salt flag.
If you disable the grain, you can use a network module to provide FQDNS services, without the risk of the client becoming unresponsive.

[NOTE]
====
This only applies to older Salt clients.
If you registered your Salt client recently, the FQDNS grain is disabled by default.
====


On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, use this command to disable the FQDNS grain:

----
salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_disable_fqdns_grain
----

This command restarts each client and generate Salt events that the server needs to process.
If you have a large number of clients, you can execute the command in batch mode instead:

----
salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_disable_fqdns_grain
----

Wait for the batch command to finish executing.
Do not interrupt the process with kbd:[Ctrl+C].
