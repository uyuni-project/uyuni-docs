Every time a Salt client starts, it passes the ``machine_id`` grain to {productname}. {productname} uses this grain to determine if the client is registered.
This process requires a synchronous Salt call. Synchronous Salt calls block other processes, so if you have a lot of clients start at the same time, the process could create significant delays.

To overcome this problem, a new feature has been introduced in Salt to avoid making a separate synchronous Salt call.

To use this feature, you can add a configuration parameter to the client configuration, on clients that support it.

To make this process easier, you can use the ``mgr_start_event_grains.sls`` helper Salt state.

[NOTE]
====
This only applies to already registered clients.
If you registered your Salt client recently, this config parameter is added by default.
====


On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, use this command to enable the ``start_event_grains`` configuration helper:

----
salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_start_event_grains
----

This command adds the required configuration into the client's configuration file, and applies it when the client is restarted.
If you have a large number of clients, you can execute the command in batch mode instead:

----
salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls mgr_start_event_grains
----
