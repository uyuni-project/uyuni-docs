When a customer has configured [path]``/var/lib/pgsql`` as directory to be checked for disk space usage, the following warning can be seen:

----
Some important directories are missing.
Please contact your system administrator to review the configuration.
----

The message indicates that a directory specified for monitoring in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` (specifically within the [literal]``spacecheck_dirs`` parameter) cannot be found. 

In containerized {productname} environments, the database resides in a separate container. 
Consequently, the [path]``/var/lib/pgsql`` directory is not present in the server container where the check is executed.

To resolve this issue, edit [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` and remove [literal]``/var/lib/pgsql`` and any derived paths from the [literal]``spacecheck_dirs`` list.
