Some older bootstrap scripts create a link to the local certificate in the wrong place.
This results in zypper returning an ``Unrecognized error`` about the local issuer certificate.
You can ensure that the link to the local issuer certificate has been created correctly by checking the [path]``/etc/ssl/certs/`` directory.
If you come across this problem, you should consider updating your bootstrap scripts to ensure that zypper operates as expected.
