Synchronization can fail for a number of reasons.
To get more information about a connection problem, run this command:

----
export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG
spacewalk-repo-sync -c <channelname> <options> > /var/log/spacewalk-repo-sync-$(date +%F-%R).log 2>&1
----

You can also check logs created by Zypper at [path]``/var/log/zypper.log``


GPG Key Mismatch::
{productname} does not automatically trust third party GPG keys.
If package synchronization fails, it could be because of an untrusted GPG key.
You can find out if this is the case by opening [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync`` and looking for an error like this:
+
----
['/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync', '--channel', 'sle-12-sp1-ga-desktop-
nvidia-driver-x86_64', '--type', 'yum', '--non-interactive']
RepoMDError: Cannot access repository. Maybe repository GPG keys are not imported
----
+
To resolve the problem, you need to import the GPG key to {productname}.
For more on importing GPG keys, see xref:administration:repo-metadata.adoc[].


GPG Key Removal from [literal]``spacewalk-repo-sync``::
When a GPG key for repository has been manually imported using [literal]``spacewalk-repo-sync``, and this key is no longer needed (for example if the the key was compromised, or was used for testing purposes only), it can be removed from the zypper RPM database used by [literal]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` with the following command:
+
----
rpm --dbpath=/var/lib/spacewalk/reposync/root/var/lib/rpm/ -e gpg-pubkey-*
----
+
where [literal]``gpg-pubkey-*`` is the name of the GPG key to be removed.



Renewing GPG Key::
If you want to renew a GPG key, first remove the old key, and then generate and import a new one.

Checksum Mismatch::
If a checksum has failed, you might see an error like this in the [path]``/var/log/rhn/reposync/*.log`` log file:
+
----
Repo Sync Errors: (50, u'checksums did not match
326a904c2fbd7a0e20033c87fc84ebba6b24d937 vs
afd8c60d7908b2b0e2d95ad0b333920aea9892eb', 'Invalid information uploaded
to the server')
The package microcode_ctl-1.17-102.57.62.1.x86_64 which is referenced by
patch microcode_ctl-8413 was not found in the database. This patch has
been skipped.
----
+
You can resolve this error by running the synchronization from the command prompt with the [command]``-Y`` option:
+
----
spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channelname> -Y
----
+
This option verifies the repository data before the synchronization, rather than relying on locally cached checksums.


Connection Timeout::
If the download times out with the following error:
+
----
28, 'Operation too slow. Less than 1000 bytes/sec transferred the last 300 seconds
----
+
You can resolve this error by specifying [literal]``reposync_timeout`` and [literal]``reposync_minrate`` configuration values in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``. 
By default, when less than 1000 bytes per second are transferred in 300 secs, the download is aborted.
You can adjust the number of bytes per second with [literal]``reposync_minrate``, and the number of seconds to wait with [literal]``reposync_timeout``.
