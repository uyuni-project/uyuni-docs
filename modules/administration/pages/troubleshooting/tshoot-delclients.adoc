Sometimes a new registration of a deleted (unregistered) client might not be possible.
To solve this issue, some Salt cache files should be deleted on the {productname} Server (Salt master) before trying to re-register again:

----
rm /var/cache/salt/master/thin/version
rm /var/cache/salt/master/thin/thin.tgz
----
