Sometimes clients connected through a proxy appear in the {webui}, but do not show that they are connected through a proxy.
This can occur if you are not using the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to connect, and the proxy is not known to {productname}.

To correct this behavior, specify additional FQDNs as grains in the client configuration file on the proxy:

----
grains:
  susemanager:
    custom_fqdns:
      - name.one
      - name.two
----
