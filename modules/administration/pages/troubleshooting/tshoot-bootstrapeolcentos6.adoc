== Bootstrap End-of-Life {centos} 6 Clients

{centos} 6 is now at end-of-life, and the images provided in the client repository for this operating system are out of date.
Bootstrapping new {centos} 6 clients using these packages will fail.
This failure will not happen on {centos} 6 clients that are already installed and bootstrapped.

If you need to bootstrap new {centos} 6 clients you can edit the existing repositories to reflect the correct URL.



.Procedure: Troubleshooting Bootstrapping a New {centos} 6 Client
. On the {centos} 6 client, at the command prompt, open the ``CentOS-Base.repo`` file, located in the ``/etc/yum.repos.d/`` directory.
. Locate the ``mirrorlist`` entry, pointing to ``mirrorlist.centos.org``.
  There may be more than one entry.
  For example:
+
----
mirrorlist=http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=6&arch=$basearch&repo=os
----
+
. Comment out the ``mirrorlist`` entry, to prevent the package manager looking for the URL.
. Edit the ``baseurl`` line to point to a ``vault.centos.org`` URL, and specify the {centos} 6 repositories.
  For example:
+
----
baseurl=https://vault.centos.org/centos/6/os/$basearch/
----
. Repeat for each repository listed in the file.
. Bootstrap the client.
