= Troubleshooting Mounting /tmp with noexec

Salt runs remote commands from [path]``/tmp`` on the client's file system.
Therefore you must not mount [path]``/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.
The other way to solve this issue is to override temporary directory path with the [literal]``TMPDIR`` environment variable specified for the Salt service to make it pointing to the directory with no [option]``noexec`` option set.
It is recommended to use systemd drop-in configuration file [path]``/etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-TMPDIR.conf`` if Salt Bundle is used, or [path]``/etc/systemd/system/salt-minion.service.d/10-TMPDIR.conf`` if [package]``salt-minion`` is used on the client.
The example of the drop-in configuration file content:
----
[Service]
Environment=TMPDIR=/var/tmp
----
