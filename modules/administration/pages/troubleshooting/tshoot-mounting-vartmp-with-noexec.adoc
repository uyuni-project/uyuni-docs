= Troubleshooting Mounting /var/tmp with noexec

Salt SSH is using [path]``/var/tmp`` to deploy Salt Bundle to and execute Salt commands on the client with the bundled Python.
Therefore you must not mount [path]``/var/tmp`` with the [option]``noexec`` option.
It is not possible to bootstrap the clients, which have [path]``/var/tmp`` mounted with [option]``noexec`` option, with the {webui} because the bootstrap process is using Salt SSH to reach a client.
