If the schema upgrade fails, the database version check and all the other spacewalk services do not start.
Run [command]``spacewalk-service start`` for more information and hints how to proceed.

You can also run the version check directly:

----
systemctl status uyuni-check-database.service
----

or

----
journalctl -u uyuni-check-database.service
----

These commands print debug information if you do not want to run the more general [command]``spacewalk-service`` command.
