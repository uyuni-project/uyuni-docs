If you are using {productname} to manage virtual machines, you might find it useful to create clones of your VMs.
A clone is a VM that uses a primary disk that is an exact copy of an existing disk.

While cloning VMs can save you a lot of time, the duplicated identifying information on the disk can sometimes cause problems.

If you have a client that is already registered, you create a clone of that client, and then try and register the clone, you probably want {productname} to register them as two separate clients.
However, if the machine ID in both the original client and the clone is the same, {productname} registers both clients as one system, and the existing client data is overwritten with that of the clone.

This can be resolved by changing the machine ID of the clone, so that {productname} recognizes them as two different clients.

[NOTE]
====
Each step of this procedure is performed on the cloned client.
This procedure does not manipulate the original client, which remains registered to {productname}.

.Procedure: Resolving Duplicate Machine IDs in Cloned Salt Clients

. On the cloned machine, change the hostname and IP addresses.
    Make sure [path]``/etc/hosts`` contains the changes you made and the correct host entries.
. For distributions that support systemd: If your machines have the same machine ID, as root, delete the files on each duplicated client and re-create it:
+
----
rm /etc/machine-id
rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
rm /var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId
dbus-uuidgen --ensure
systemd-machine-id-setup
----

. For distributions that do not support systemd: As root, generate a machine ID from dbus:
+
----
rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
rm /var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId
dbus-uuidgen --ensure
----
. If your clients still have the same Salt client ID, delete the [path]``minion_id`` file on each client (FQDN is used when it is regenerated on client restart).
  For Salt Minion clients:
+

----
rm /etc/salt/minion_id
rm -rf /etc/salt/pki
----
+

For Salt Bundle clients:
+

----
rm /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion_id
rm -rf /etc/venv-salt-minion/pki
----
. Delete accepted keys from the onboarding page and the system profile from {productname}, and restart the client with:
+
----
service salt-minion restart
----
. Re-register the clients.
  Each client now has a different [path]``/etc/machine-id`` and should be correctly displayed on the [guimenu]``System Overview`` page.
