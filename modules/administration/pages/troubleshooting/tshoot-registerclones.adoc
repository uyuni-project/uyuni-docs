If you are using {productname} to manage virtual machines, you might find it useful to create clones of your VMs.
A clone is a VM that uses a primary disk that is an exact copy of an existing disk.

While cloning VMs can save you a lot of time, the duplicated identifying information on the disk can sometimes cause problems.

If you have a client that is already registered, you create a clone of that client, and then try and register the clone, you probably want {productname} to register them as two separate clients.
However, if the machine ID in both the original client and the clone is the same, {productname} registers both clients as one system, and the existing client data is overwritten with that of the clone.

This can be resolved by changing the machine ID of the clone, so that {productname} recognizes them as two different clients.

[NOTE]
====
Each step of this procedure is performed on the cloned client.
This procedure does not manipulate the original client, which remains registered to {productname}.

.Procedure: Resolving Duplicate Machine IDs in Cloned Salt Clients
[role=procedure]
____

. *Initial System Configuration*


. On the cloned machine, change the hostname and IP addresses.
    Make sure [path]``/etc/hosts`` contains the changes you made and the correct host entries.


. *Resolving Duplicate Machine IDs*

. _For distributions that support systemd:_
   If your machines have the same machine ID, as root, delete the files on each duplicated client and re-create it:

+
----
rm /etc/machine-id
rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
rm /var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId
dbus-uuidgen --ensure
systemd-machine-id-setup
----

. If the cloned machine also has a folder in [path]``/var/log/journal/`` it needs to be renamed accordingly to the new machine ID.
If names do not match, [command]``journalctl`` could not retrieve any log and [command]``podman logs`` would not show anything.

+

----
mv /var/log/journal/* /var/log/journal/$(cat /etc/machine-id)
----

. _For distributions that do not support systemd:_ 
   As root, generate a machine ID from dbus:

+

----
rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
rm /var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId
dbus-uuidgen --ensure
----

. *Fixing Kernel Entries on {rhel} 8.10

. If you are cloning a {rhel} 8.10 server that will later be liberated to {sll}, you must perform extra steps to fix the kernel configuration files. 

+

[IMPORTANT]
====
{rhel} uses the machine ID to generate kernel entries in [path]``/boot/loader/entries``. 
Not performing these steps will result in a mix of old and new kernel entries after the liberation, as {sll} kernels will create new entries instead of replacing the old ones.
====

+
. After changing the machine ID and before liberating, run:

+
----
sudo rm -rf /boot/loader/entries/
sudo  for ver in $(rpm -q kernel --qf '%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{ARCH}\n'); do echo "Reinstalling kernel $ver..."; sudo kernel-install add $ver /lib/modules/$ver; done
sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
----

. *Reconfiguring {salt} Clients*

. If your clients still have the same Salt client ID, delete the [path]``minion_id`` file on each client (FQDN is used when it is regenerated on client restart).
  For Salt Minion clients:
+

----
rm /etc/salt/minion_id
rm -rf /etc/salt/pki
----

+

For Salt Bundle clients:

+

----
rm /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion_id
rm -rf /etc/venv-salt-minion/pki
----

. Delete accepted keys from the onboarding page and the system profile from {productname}, and restart the client with.
  For Salt Minion clients:

+

----
service salt-minion restart
----

+

For Salt Bundle clients: 

+

----
service venv-salt-minion restart
----
. Re-register the clients.
  Each client now has a different [path]``/etc/machine-id`` and should be correctly displayed on the [guimenu]``System Overview`` page.
