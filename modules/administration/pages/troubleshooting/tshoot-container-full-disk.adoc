In case a dedicated disk mounted as a persistent storage medium of a container runs out of storage space, an emergency action is needed.

Proceed as follows to solve the problem with resizing the storage medium.
Run all listed commands as [literal]``root`` on the container host.

.Procedure: Resize Storage Medium

. Increase the disk (for example, [path]``/dev/vdb``) size.
  For example, if the disk is a QCOW2 image, use the command [command]``qemu-img resize``.

. Ensure the partition uses all available space.
  Run the following commands:

--
.. [command]``parted /dev/vdb``
.. [literal]``(parted)`` [command]``print``
.. [literal]``(parted)`` [command]``resizepart NUMBER 100%`` where [literal]``NUMBER`` is the partition number shown by [command]``print`` command (for example, [literal]``1`` if [literal]``/dev/vdb1``)
.. [literal]``(parted)`` [command]``quit``
--

. Resize the filesystem.
  For example, for an XFS filesystem, run the command:

+

[source,shell]
----
xfs_growfs /dev/vdb1
----

After completing the procedure, an XFS filesystem on [literal]``/dev/vdb1`` should be using all space available on the disk.
