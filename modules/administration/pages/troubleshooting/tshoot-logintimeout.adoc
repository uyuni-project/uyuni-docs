Consequence: What does the user see when this happens?
Fix: What can the user do to fix this problem?
Result: What happens after the user has completed the fix?

By default, the {productname} {webui} requires users to log in again after 30{nbsp}minutes.
Depending on your environment, you might want to adjust the login timeout value.

To adjust the value, you need to make the change in both [path]``rhn.conf`` and [path]``web.xml``.
Ensure you set the value in seconds in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``, and in minutes in [path]``web.xml``.
The two values must equal the same amount of time.

For example, to change the timeout value to one hour, set the value in [path]``rhn.conf`` to 3600 seconds, and the value in [path]``web.xml`` to 60 minutes.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Use [literal]``mgrctl term`` before running steps inside the server container.

correct. Path is now /usr/share/susemanager/www/tomcat/webapps/rhn/WEB-INF/web.xml , but it should be somewhere else in /srv: this is because in uyuni container changes in /usr/share/susemanager/ are not persisted. I'll open an issue for it, we need somehow to change this path and then re-change documentation
