= Content Staging


Staging is used by clients to download packages in advance, before they are installed.
This allows package installation to begin as soon as it is scheduled, which can reduce the amount of time required for a maintenance window.


== Enable Content Staging

You can manage content staging across your entire organization.
In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Organizations] to see a list of available organizations.
Click the name of an organization, and check the [guimenu]``Enable Staging Contents`` box to allow clients in this organization to stage package data.

[NOTE]
====
You must be logged in as a {productname} administrator to create and manage organizations.
====

You can also enable staging at the command prompt by editing [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date``, and adding or editing these lines:

----
stagingContent=1
stagingContentWindow=24
----

////
2018-12-10, ke: /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date still exists. @renner confirmed some tools use it (at least, trad. client).  To be renamed in the future.
////

The ``stagingContentWindow`` parameter is a time value expressed in hours and determines when downloading will start.
It is the number of hours before the scheduled installation or update time.
In this example, content will be downloaded 24 hours before the installation time.
The start time for download depends on the selected contact method for a system.
The assigned contact method sets the time for when the next [command]``mgr_check`` will be executed.

Next time an action is scheduled, packages are automatically downloaded, but not installed.
At the scheduled time, the staged packages are installed.



== Configure Content Staging

There are two parameters used to configure content staging:

* [parameter]``salt_content_staging_advance`` is the advance time for the content staging window to open, in hours.
    This is the number of hours before installation starts, that package downloads can begin.
* [parameter]``salt_content_staging_window`` is the duration of the content staging window, in hours.
    This is the amount of time clients have to stage packages before installation begins.

For example, if [parameter]``salt_content_staging_advance`` is set to six hours, and [parameter]``salt_content_staging_window`` is set to two hours, the staging window will open six hours before the installation time, and remain open for two hours.
No packages will be downloaded in the four remaining hours until installation starts.

If you set the same value for both [parameter]``salt_content_staging_advance`` and [parameter]``salt_content_staging_window`` packages will be able to be downloaded until installation begins.

Configure the content staging parameters in [path]``/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java.conf``.

Default values:

* [path]``salt_content_staging_advance: 8 hours``
* [path]``salt_content_staging_window: 8 hours``


[NOTE]
====
Content staging must be enabled for these parameters to work correctly.
