{productname} includes the ability to synchronize the content of optional third-party repositories with some of the products that can be managed by it.

Some third-party GPG keys are included by default in the {productname} database, and some are not. 
For third-party keys that are not included, the relevant keys need to be imported when choosing to synchronize such third-party repositories.

To import a GPG key, use the following command syntax, executing the command on the {productname} host server:

----
mgradm gpg add <path-to-gpg-key-file-or-URL>
----

. Example: Adding a GPG key from a file: 
+
----
mgradm gpg add repomd.xml.key
----

. Example: Adding a GPG key from a remote repository using a URL:
+
----
mgradm gpg add https://<3rd-party-domain>/path/to/repository/repodata/repomd.xml.key
----

To list the keys currently held in the {productname} GPG database, run the following command:

----
mgrctl exec -ti -- gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys
----

[NOTE]
====
When installing a package on the client, you may also need to trust the GPG key on the client itself.
This requires that the GPG key is also available there.

For more information, see: xref:client-configuration:gpg-keys.adoc[].
