= Third-party Channels

{productname} includes the ability to synchronize the content of optional third-party repositories with some of the products that can be managed by it.

Some third-party GPG keys are included by default in the {productname} database, and some are not. 
For third-party keys that are not included, the relevant keys need to be imported when choosing to synchronize such third-party repositories.

To import a GPG key, use the following command syntax, executing the command on the {productname} host server:

----
# mgradm gpg add <path-to-gpg-key-file-or-URL>
----

. Example: Adding a GPG key from a file: 

----
# mgradm gpg add repomd.xml.key
----

. Example: Adding a GPG key from a remote repository using a URL:

----
# mgradm gpg add https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/yum/OSS/SLES/15/ppc64le/repodata/repomd.xml.key
----

To list the keys currently held in the {productname} GPG database, run the following command from inside the server container:

----
# gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys
----
