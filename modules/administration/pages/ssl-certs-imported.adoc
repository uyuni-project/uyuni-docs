= Import SSL Certificates

//By default, {productname} uses a self-signed certificate.
//For additional security, you can import a custom certificate, signed by a third party certificate authority (CA).

This section covers how to configure SSL certificate for new {productname} installation, and how to replace existing certificates.

Before you begin, ensure you have:

* A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate.
  If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available.
* An SSL server private key
* An SSL server certificate

All files must be in PEM format.

The hostname of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on.
You can set the hostnames in the [literal]``X509v3 Subject Alternative Name`` section of the certificate.
You can also list multiple hostnames if your environment requires it.
Supported Key types are [literal]``RSA`` and [literal]``EC`` (Elliptic Curve).

Third-party authorities commonly use intermediate CAs to sign requested server certificates.
In this case, all CAs in the chain are required to be available.
If there is no extra parameter or option available to specify intermediate CAs, take care that all CAs (Root CA and intermediate CAs) are stored in one file.



== Import Certificates for New Installations

By default, {productname} uses a self-signed certificate.
After you have completed the initial setup, you can replace the default certificate with an imported certificate.

.Procedure: Import Certificates on a New {productname} Server

. Deploy the {productname} Server according to the instructions in xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-server.adoc[].
  Make sure to pass the correct files as parameters to [literal]``mgradm install podman``.
  The parameters are:
+
----
3rd Party SSL Certificate Flags:
      --ssl-ca-intermediate strings   Intermediate CA certificate path
      --ssl-ca-root string            Root CA certificate path
      --ssl-server-cert string        Server certificate path
      --ssl-server-key string         Server key path
----


== Import Certificates for New Proxy Installations

By default, {productname} Proxy uses a self-signed certificate.
After you have completed the initial setup, you can replace the default certificate with an imported certificate.


.Procedure: Import Certificates on a New {productname} Proxy

. Install the {productname} Proxy according to the instructions in xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-proxy.adoc[].
. Follow the prompts to complete setup.


[NOTE]
====
Use the same certificate authority (CA) to sign all server certificates for servers and proxies.
Certificates signed with different CAs do not match.
====



[[ssl-certs-import-replace]]
== Replace Certificates


[IMPORTANT]
====
The following procedure needs to run inside of the container.
Use [literal]``mgrctl term`` to open a terminal in the container before you execute it.
====

You can replace active certificates on your {productname} installation with a new certificate.
To replace the certificates, you can replace the installed CA certificate with the new CA, and then update the database.


.Procedure: Replacing Existing Certificates

. On the {productname} container host, at the command prompt, temporarily copy the certificate files to the container:
+

----
for f in <Root_CA_Certificate> <Server_Cert_File> <Server_Key_File>; do
  mgrctl cp $f server:/tmp
done
----

. On the {productname} container host, call the following command to run [command]``mgr-ssl-cert-setup`` inside the container providing certificates as parameters:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-ssl-cert-setup --root-ca-file=/tmp/<Root_CA_Certificate> \
  --server-cert-file=/tmp/<Server_Cert_File> --server-key-file=/tmp/<Server_Key_File>
----

. Remove the temporarily copied files from the container:
+

----
mgrctl exec -ti -- rm /tmp/<Root_CA_Certificate> /tmp/<Server_Cert_File> \
  /tmp/<Server_Key_File>
----


Intermediate CAs can either be available in the file which is specified with `--root-ca-file` or specified as extra options with `--intermediate-ca-file`.
The `--intermediate-ca-file` option can be specified multiple times.
This command performs a number of tests on the provided files to test if they are valid and can be used for the requested use case.

.Procedure
. Restart services to pick up the changes:
+
----
mgradm restart
----


If you are using a proxy, you need to generate a server certificate RPM for each proxy, using their hostnames and cnames.
Generate a new configuration tarball and deploy it:

ifeval::[{mlm-content} == true]
For more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/proxy-deployment-mlm.adoc#_generate_proxy_configuration[].
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
For more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/uyuni/proxy-deployment-uyuni.adoc#proxy-setup-containers-generate-config[].
proxy-deployment-uyuni.adoc
endif::[]

If the Root CA was changed, it needs to get deployed to all the clients connected to {productname}.



=== Deploy the Root CA on Salt Clients

If the Root CA was changed, it needs to get deployed to all the clients connected to {productname}.


.Procedure: Deploying the Root CA on Salt Clients

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Overview].
. Check all your Salt Clients to add them to the system set manager.
. Navigate to menu:Systems[System Set Manager > Overview].
. In the [guimenu]``States`` field, click btn:[Apply] to apply the system states.
. In the [guimenu]``Highstate`` page, click btn:[Apply Highstate] to propagate the changes to the clients.
