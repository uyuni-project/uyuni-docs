= Disconnected Setup

When it is not possible to connect {productname} to the internet, you can use it within a disconnected environment.

The repository mirroring tool (RMT) is available on {sle}{nbsp}15 and later.
RMT replaces the subscription management tool (SMT), which can be used on older {sle} installations.

In a disconnected {productname} setup, RMT or SMT uses an external network to connect to {scc}.
All software channels and repositories are synchronized to a removable storage device.
The storage device can then be used to update the disconnected {productname} installation.

This setup allows your {productname} installation to remain in an offline, disconnected environment.

[NOTE]
====
Your RMT or SMT instance must be used to manage the {productname} Server directly.
It cannot be used to manage a second RMT or SMT instance, in a cascade.
====

For more information on RMT, see {sles-base-os-documentation}/book-rmt.html.


== Synchronize RMT

You can use RMT on {sle} 15 installations to manage clients running {sle} 12 or later.

We recommend you set up a dedicated RMT instance for each {productname} installation.



.Procedure: Setting up RMT
. On the RMT instance, install the RMT package:
+
----
zypper in rmt-server
----
. Configure RMT using {yast}:
+
----
yast2 rmt
----
. Follow the prompts to complete installation.

For more information on setting up RMT, see {sles-base-os-documentation}/book-rmt.html.



.Procedure: Synchronizing RMT with SCC
. On the RMT instance, list all available products and repositories for your organization:
+
----
rmt-cli products list --all
rmt-cli repos list --all
----
. Synchronize all available updates for your organization:
+
----
rmt-cli sync
----
You can also configure RMT to synchronize regularly using systemd.
. Enable the products you require.
    For example, to enable SLES 15:
+
----
rmt-cli product enable sles/15/x86_64
----
. Export the synchronized data to your removable storage.
    In this example, the storage medium is mounted at [path]``/mnt/usb``:
+
----
rmt-cli export data /mnt/usb
----
. Export the enabled repositories to your removable storage:
+
----
rmt-cli export settings /mnt/usb
rmt-cli export repos /mnt/usb
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user.
You can change RMT user settings in the `cli` section of [path]``/etc/rmt.conf``.
====



== Synchronize SMT


SMT is included with {sle} 12, and can be used to manage clients running {sle} 10 or later.

SMT requires you to create a local mirror directory on the SMT instance to synchronize repositories and packages.

For more details on installing and configuring SMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/book-smt.html.



.Procedure: Synchronizing SMT with SCC
. On the SMT instance, create a database replacement file:
+
----
smt-sync --createdbreplacementfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml
----
. Export the synchronized data to your removable storage.
  In this example, the storage medium is mounted at [path]``/mnt/usb``:
+
----
smt-sync --todir /mnt/usb
smt-mirror --dbreplfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml --directory /mnt/usb \
           --fromlocalsmt -L /var/log/smt/smt-mirror-export.log
curl https://scc.suse.com/suma/product_tree.json -o /mnt/usb/product_tree.json
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user.
You can change SMT user settings in [path]``/etc/smt.conf``.
====



== Mandatory Channels

The corresponding {productname} Client Tools Channels are required, for {productname} to be able to synchronize a given channel.
If these channels are not enabled, {productname} may fail to detect that product.

Run the following command to enable these mandatory channels:

SLES 12 and products based on it such as SLES for SAP or SLE HPC::
RMT: [command]``rmt-cli products enable sle-manager-tools/12/x86_64``
+
SMT: [command]``smt repos -p sle-manager-tools,12,x86_64``

SLES 15 and products based on it such as SLES for SAP or SLE HPC::
RMT: [command]``rmt-cli products enable sle-manager-tools/15/x86_64``
+
SMT: [command]``smt repos -p sle-manager-tools,15,x86_64``

Then mirror the channels, and export.

Other distributions, or architectures, can be enabled.
For more information about enabling product channels or repositories to be mirrored, see the documentation:

RMT:: {sles-base-os-documentation}/cha-rmt-mirroring.html#sec-rmt-mirroring-enable-disable

SMT:: https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/single-html/SLES-smt/index.html#smt-mirroring-manage-domirror



== Synchronize a Disconnected Server

When you have removable media loaded with your {scc} data, you can use it to synchronize your disconnected server.


//// 
OLD
.Procedure: Synchronizing a Disconnected Server
. Mount your removable media device to the {productname} server.
    In this example, the mount point is [path]``/media/disk``.
. Open ``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` and define the mount point by adding or editing this line:
+
----
server.susemanager.fromdir = /media/disk
----
+
. Restart the Tomcat service:
+
----
systemctl restart tomcat
----
. Refresh the local data:
+
----
mgr-sync refresh
----
. Perform a synchronization:
+
----
mgr-sync list channels
mgr-sync add channel channel-label
----
////

// NEW: 

.Procedure: Synchronizing a Disconnected Server
. Install the server container with 
+
----
mgradm install podman --mirror /media/disk
----
+
. Restart the Tomcat service:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- systemctl restart tomcat
----
. Refresh the local data:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- mgr-sync refresh
----
. Perform a synchronization:
+
----
mgrctl exec -- mgr-sync list channels
mgrctl exec -- mgr-sync add channel channel-label
----



[WARNING]
====
The removable disk that you use for synchronization must always be available at the same mount point.
Do not trigger a synchronization, if the storage medium is not mounted.
This results in data corruption.
====

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that if [literal]``server.susemanager.fromdir`` is set, {productname} will not be able to check if {scc} credentials are valid or not.
Instead, a warning sign will be displayed and no SCC online check will be performed.
