= Disconnected Setup

When it is not possible to connect {productname} to the internet, you can use it within a disconnected environment.

The repository mirroring tool (RMT) is available on {sle}{nbsp}15 and later.
RMT replaces the subscription management tool (SMT), which can be used on older {sle} installations.

In a disconnected {productname} setup, RMT or SMT uses an external network to connect to {scc}.
All software channels and repositories are synchronized to a removable storage device.
The storage device can then be used to update the disconnected {productname} installation.

This setup allows your {productname} installation to remain in an offline, disconnected environment.

[NOTE]
====
Your RMT or SMT instance must be used to managed a {productname} Server directly.
It cannot be used to manage a second RMT or SMT instance, in a cascade.
====

For more information on RMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/book-rmt.html.


== Synchronize RMT

You can use RMT on {sle} 15 installations to manage clients running {sle} 12 or later.

We recommend you set up a dedicated RMT instance for each {productname} installation.

.Procedure: Setting up RMT
. On the RMT instance, install the RMT package:
+
----
zypper in rmt-server
----
. Configure RMT using {yast}:
+
----
yast2 rmt
----
. Follow the prompts to complete installation.
    For more information on setting up RMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/book-rmt.html.

.Procedure: Synchronizing RMT with SCC
. On the RMT instance, list all available products and repositories for your organization:
+
----
rmt-cli products list --all
rmt-cli repos list --all
----
. Synchronize all available updates for your organization:
+
----
rmt-cli sync
----
You can also configure RMT to synchronize regularly using systemd.
. Enable the products you require.
    For example, to enable SLES 15:
+
----
rmt-cli product enable sles/15/x86_64
----
. Export the synchronized data to your removable storage.
    In this example, the storage medium is mounted at [path]``/mnt/usb``:
+
----
rmt-cli export data /mnt/usb
----
. Export the enabled repositories to your removable storage:
----
rmt-cli export settings /mnt/usb
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user.
You can change RMT user settings in the `cli` section of [path]``/etc/rmt.conf``.
====



== Synchronize SMT


SMT is included with {sle} 12, and can be used to manage clients running {sle} 10 or later.

SMT requires you to create a local mirror directory on the SMT instance to synchronize repositories and packages.

For more details on installing and configuring SMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/book-smt.html.

.Procedure: Synchronizing SMT with SCC
. On the SMT instance, create a database replacement file:
+
----
smt-sync --createdbreplacementfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml
----
. Export the synchronized data to your removable storage.
    In this example, the storage medium is mounted at [path]``/mnt/usb``:
+
----
smt-sync --todir /mnt/usb
smt-mirror --dbreplfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml --directory /mnt/usb \
           --fromlocalsmt -L /var/log/smt/smt-mirror-export.log
----
. Export the enabled repositories to your removable storage:
----
rmt-cli export settings /mnt/usb
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user.
You can change SMT user settings in [path]``/etc/smt.conf``.
====



== Synchronize a Disconnected Server

When you have removable media loaded with your {scc} data, you can use it to synchronize your disconnected server.

.Procedure: Synchronizing a Disconnected Server
. Mount your removable media device to the {productname} server.
    In this example, the mount point is [path]``/media/disk``.
. Open ``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` and define the mount point by adding or editing this line:
+
----
server.susemanager.fromdir = /media/disk
----
+
. Restart the Tomcat service:
+
----
systemctl restart tomcat
----
. Refresh the local data:
+
----
mgr-sync refresh
----
. Perform a synchronization:
+
----
mgr-sync list channels
mgr-sync add channel channel-label
----

[WARNING]
====
The removable disk that you use for synchronization must always be available at the same mount point.
Do not trigger a synchronization, if the storage medium is not mounted.
This will result in data corruption.
