= Image Building and Management



[[at.images.overview]]
== Image Building Overview

{productname} enables system administrators to build containers and OS Images and push the result in image stores.
The workflow looks like this:

. Define an image store
. Define an image profile and associate it with a source (either a git repository or a directory)
. Build the image
. Push the image to the image store

{productname} supports two distinct build types: dockerfile, and the Kiwi image system.

The Kiwi build type is used to build system, virtual, and other images.
The image store for the Kiwi build type is pre-defined as a file system directory at [path]``/srv/www/os-images`` on the server.
{productname} serves the image store over HTTPS from [literal]``//<SERVER-FQDN>/os-images/``.
The image store location is unique and is not customizable.

Images are always stored in [path]``/srv/www/os-image/<organization id>``.



[[at.images.docker]]
== Container Images

image::image-building.png[scaledwidth=80%]



[[at.images.docker.requirements]]
=== Requirements


The containers feature is available for Salt clients running {sles} 12 or later.
Before you begin, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

* A published git repository containing a dockerfile and configuration scripts.
  The repository can be public or private, and should be hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
* A properly configured image store, such as a Docker registry.
+

For more information on Containers, see:
+

* https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/book-container.html



[[at.images.docker.buildhost]]
=== Create a Build Host


To build images with {productname}, you need to create and configure a build host.
Container build hosts are Salt clients running {sle} 12 or later.
This section guides you through the initial configuration for a build host.



[IMPORTANT]
====
The operating system on the build host must match the operating system on the targeted image.

For example, build {sles}{nbsp}15 based images on a build host running {sles}{nbsp}15 (SP2 or later) OS version.
Build {sles}{nbsp}12 based images on a build host running {sles}{nbsp}12 SP4 or {sles}{nbsp}12 SP3 OS version.

Cross-architecture builds are unsupported.
////
2022-05-12, ke: at least for now, according to feedback, this is unsupported:
For example, you must build Raspberry Pi {sles}{nbsp}15 SP3 images on a Raspberry Pi (aarch64 architecture) build host running {sles}{nbsp}15 SP3.
////
====

From the {productname} {webui}, perform these steps to configure a build host:

. Select a Salt client to be designated as a build host from the menu:Systems[Overview] page.
. From the [guimenu]``System Details`` page of the selected client assign the containers modules.
  Go to menu:Software[Software Channels] and enable the containers module (for example, [guimenu]``SLE-Module-Containers15-Pool`` and [guimenu]``SLE-Module-Containers15-Updates``).
  Confirm by clicking btn:[Change Subscriptions].
. From the menu:System Details[Properties] page, enable ``Container Build Host`` from the [guimenu]``Add-on System Types`` list and confirm by clicking btn:[Update Properties].
. Install all required packages by applying ``Highstate``.
  From the system details page select menu:States[Highstate] and click [guimenu]``Apply Highstate``.
  Alternatively, apply Highstate from the {productname} Server command line:
+
----
salt '$your_client' state.highstate
----



[[at.images.docker.buildchannels]]
=== Create an Activation Key for Containers


The containers built using {productname} use channels associated to the activation key as repositories when building the image.
This section guides you through creating an ad-hoc activation key for this purpose.

[NOTE]
====
To build a container, you need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than `SUSE Manager Default`.
====

image::systems_create_activation_key.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Select menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click btn:[Create Key].
. Enter a [guimenu]``Description`` and a [guimenu]``Key`` name.
  Use the drop-down menu to select the [guimenu]``Base Channel`` to associate with this key.
. Confirm with btn:[Create Activation Key].

For more information, see <<bp.key.managment>>.



[[at.images.docker.imagestore]]
=== Create an Image Store


All built images are pushed to an image store.
This section contains information about creating an image store.

image::images_image_stores.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Select menu:Images[Stores].
. Click [guimenu]``Create`` to create a new store.
+

image::images_image_stores_create.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Define a name for the image store in the [guimenu]``Label`` field.
. Provide the path to your image registry by filling in the [guimenu]``URI`` field, as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the container registry host (whether internal or external).


----
registry.example.com
----


The Registry URI can also be used to specify an image store on a registry that is already in use.

----
registry.example.com:5000/myregistry/myproject
----

. Click btn:[Create] to add the new image store.



[[at.images.docker.profile]]
=== Create an Image Profile


All container images are built using an image profile, which contains the building instructions.
This section contains information about creating an image profile with the {productname} {webui}.

image::images_image_profiles.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Create an Image Profile
. To create an image profile select menu:Images[Profiles] and click btn:[Create].
+

image::images_image_create_profile.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. Provide a name for the image profile by filling in the [guimenu]``Label`` field.
+

[NOTE]
====
If your container image tag is in a format such as `myproject/myimage`, make sure your image store registry URI contains the `/myproject` suffix.
====

. Use a dockerfile as the `Image Type`.

. Use the drop-down menu to select your registry from the `Target Image Store` field.

. In the [guimenu]``Path`` field, type a GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repository URL.
  The URL should be be http, https, or a token authentication URL.
  Use one of these formats:

.GitHub Path Options
* GitHub single user project repository
+
----
https://github.com/USER/project.git#branchname:folder
----

* GitHub organization project repository
+
----
https://github.com/ORG/project.git#branchname:folder
----

* GitHub token authentication
+

If your git repository is private, modify the profile's URL to include authentication.
Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitHub token:
+

----
https://USER:<AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>@github.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/
----

.GitLab Path Options
* GitLab single user project repository
+

----
https://gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/
----

* GitLab groups project repository
+

----
https://gitlab.example.com/GROUP/project.git#master:/container/
----

* GitLab token authentication
+

If your git repository is private and not publicly accessible, you need to modify the profile's git URL to include authentication.
Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitLab token:
+

----
https://gitlab-ci-token:<AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN>@gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not specify a git branch, the `master` branch is used by default.
If a `folder` is not specified, the image sources (dockerfile sources) are expected to be in the root directory of the GitHub or GitLab checkout.
====

. Select an `Activation Key`.
  Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages.
+

[NOTE]
====
When you associate an activation key with an image profile you are ensuring any image using the profile uses the correct software channel and any packages in the channel.
====

. Click the btn:[Create] button.



[[at.images.docker.sourceexample]]
.Example Dockerfile Sources


An Image Profile that can be reused is published at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles

[NOTE]
====
The [option]``ARG`` parameters ensure that the built image is associated with the desired repository served by {productname}.
The [option]``ARG`` parameters also allow you to build image versions of {sles} which may differ from the version of {sles} used by the build host itself.

For example: The [command]``ARG repo`` parameter and the [command]``echo`` command pointing to the repository file, creates and then injects the correct path into the repository file for the desired channel version.

The repository is determined by the activation key that you assigned to your image profile.

//TODO: Replace the "custom-system-info" link
.Using Custom Info Key-value Pairs as Docker Buildargs
You can assign custom info key-value pairs to attach information to the image profiles.
Additionally, these key-value pairs are passed to the Docker build command as `buildargs`.

For more information about the available custom info keys and creating additional ones, see xref:reference:systems/custom-system-info.adoc[].


[[at.images.docker.building]]
=== Build an Image


There are two ways to build an image.
You can select menu:Images[Build] from the left navigation bar, or click the build icon in the menu:Images[Profiles] list.

image::images_image_build.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Building an Image
. Select menu:Images[Build].
. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default ``latest`` (only relevant to containers).
. Select [guimenu]``Build Profile`` and [guimenu]``Build Host``.
+

[NOTE]
====
Notice the [guimenu]``Profile Summary`` to the right of the build fields.
When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile is displayed in this area.
====

. To schedule a build click the btn:[Build] button.



[[at.images.docker.importing]]
=== Import an Image


You can import and inspect arbitrary images.
Select menu:Images[Image List] from the left navigation bar.
Complete the text boxes of the [guimenu]``Import`` dialog.
When it has processed, the imported image is listed on the [guimenu]``Image List`` page.

.Procedure: Importing an Image
. From menu:Images[Image list] click btn:[Import] to open the [guimenu]``Import Image`` dialog.
. In the [guimenu]``Import Image`` dialog complete these fields:
+

Image store:::
The registry from where the image is pulled for inspection.

Image name:::
The name of the image in the registry.

Image version:::
The version of the image in the registry.

Build host:::
The build host that pulls and inspects the image.

Activation key:::
The activation key that provides the path to the software channel that the image is inspected with.

. For confirmation, click btn:[Import].

The entry for the image is created in the database, and an ``Inspect Image`` action on {productname} is scheduled.

When it has been processed, you can find the imported image in the ``Image List``.
It has a different icon in the ``Build`` column, to indicate that the image is imported.
The status icon for the imported image can also be seen on the ``Overview`` tab for the image.



[[at.images.docker.troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting


These are some known problems when working with images:

* HTTPS certificates to access the registry or the git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file.
* SSH git access using Docker is currently unsupported.



[[at.images.kiwi]]
== OS Images

OS Images are built by the Kiwi image system.
The output image is customizable and can be PXE, QCOW2, LiveCD, or other types of images.

For more information about the Kiwi build system, see the https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/[Kiwi documentation].



[[at.images.kiwi.requirements]]
=== Requirements

The Kiwi image building feature is available for Salt clients running {sles}{nbsp}12 and {sles}{nbsp}11.
//SLE15 images support is not yet released for SUMA4, but is part of SUMA4.0.4 as tech preview
//From {sles}{nbsp}15, ``kiwi-ng`` is used instead of the legacy Kiwi.

Kiwi image configuration files and configuration scripts must be accessible in one of these locations:

* Git repository
* HTTP hosted tarball
* Local build host directory

For an example of a complete Kiwi repository served by git, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage

[NOTE]
====
You need at least 1{nbsp}GB of RAM available for hosts running OS Images built with Kiwi.
Disk space depends on the actual size of the image.
For more information, see the documentation of the underlying system.
====

[WARNING]
====
The build host must be a Salt client.
Do not install the build host as a traditional client.
====



[[at.images.kiwi.buildhost]]
=== Create a Build Host

To build all kinds of images with {productname}, create and configure a build host.
OS Image build hosts are Salt clients running on {sles}{nbsp}15 (SP2 or later), {sles}{nbsp}12 (SP3 or later) or {sles}{nbsp}11 SP4.

This procedure guides you through the initial configuration for a build host.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The operating system on the build host must match the operating system on the targeted image.

For example, build {sles}{nbsp}15 based images on a build host running  {sles}{nbsp}15 (SP2 or later) OS version.
Build {sles}{nbsp}12 based images on a build host running {sles}{nbsp}12 SP4 or {sles}{nbsp}12 SP3 OS version.
Build {sles}{nbsp}11 based images on a build host running {sles}{nbsp}11 SP4 OS version.

Cross-architecture builds are not possible.
For example, you must build Raspberry PI {sles}{nbsp}15 SP3 image on a Raspberry PI (aarch64 architecture) build host running {sles}{nbsp}15 SP3.
====


Configure the build host in the {productname} {webui}:

. Select a client to be designated as a build host from the menu:Systems[Overview] page.
. Navigate to the menu:System Details[Properties] tab, enable the [guimenu]``Add-on System Type`` [guimenu]``OS Image Build Host``. Confirm with btn:[Update Properties].
+
image::os-image-build-host.png[scaledwidth=80%]
+
. Navigate to menu:System Details[Software > Software Channels], and enable the required software channels depending on the build host version.
+
* {sles}{nbsp}11 build hosts require {productname} Client tools (``SLE-Manager-Tools11-Pool`` and ``SLE-Manager-Tools11-Updates``).
* {sles}{nbsp}12 build hosts require {productname} Client tools (``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool`` and ``SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates``).
* {sles}{nbsp}15 build hosts require {sles} modules ``SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP2-Pool`` and ``SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP2-Updates``.
  Schedule and click btn:[Confirm].
. Install Kiwi and all required packages by applying `Highstate`.
  From the system details page select menu:States[Highstate] and click btn:[Apply Highstate].
  Alternatively, apply Highstate from the {productname} Server command line:
+
----
salt '$your_client' state.highstate
----

.{productname} Web Server Public Certificate RPM
Build host provisioning copies the {productname} certificate RPM to the build host.
This certificate is used for accessing repositories provided by {productname}.

The certificate is packaged in RPM by the `mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage` package script.
The package script is called automatically during a new {productname} installation.

When you upgrade the `spacewalk-certs-tools` package, the upgrade scenario calls the package script using the default values.
However if the certificate path was changed or unavailable, call the package script manually using `--ca-cert-full-path <path_to_certificate>` after the upgrade procedure has finished.


.Package script call example
[source,bash]
----
/usr/sbin/mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage --ca-cert-full-path /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT
----

The RPM package with the certificate is stored in a salt-accessible directory such as:
----
/usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
----

The RPM package with the certificate is provided in the local build host repository:
----
/var/lib/Kiwi/repo
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Specify the RPM package with the {productname} SSL certificate in the build source, and make sure your Kiwi configuration contains ``rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage`` as a required package in the ``bootstrap`` section.

.config.xml
[source,xml]
----
...
  <packages type="bootstrap">
    ...
    <package name="rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage" bootinclude="true"/>
  </packages>
...
----
====



[[at.images.kiwi.buildchannels]]
=== Create an Activation Key for OS Images

Create an activation key associated with the channel that your OS Images can use as repositories when building the image.

Activation keys are mandatory for OS Image building.

[NOTE]
====
To build OS Images, you need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than `SUSE Manager Default`.
====

image::systems_create_activation_key.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. In the {webui}, select menu:Systems[Activation Keys].
. Click [guimenu]``Create Key``.
. Enter a [guimenu]``Description``, a [guimenu]``Key`` name, and use the drop-down box to select a [guimenu]``Base Channel`` to associate with the key.
. Confirm with btn:[Create Activation Key].

For more information, see <<bp.key.managment>>.



[[at.images.kiwi.imagestore]]
=== Create an Image Store


OS Images can require a significant amount of storage space.
Therefore, we recommended that the OS Image store is located on a partition of its own or on a Btrfs subvolume, separate from the root partition.
By default, the image store is located at [path]``/srv/www/os-images``.

[NOTE]
====
Image stores for Kiwi build type, used to build system, virtual, and other images, are not supported yet.

Images are always stored in [path]``/srv/www/os-images/<organization id>`` and are accessible via HTTP/HTTPS [url]``https://<susemanager_host>/os-images/<organization id>``.
====



[[at.images.kiwi.profile]]
=== Create an Image Profile


Manage image profiles using the {webui}.

image::images_image_profiles.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Create an Image Profile
. To create an image profile select from menu:Images[Profiles] and click btn:[Create].
+

image::images_image_create_profile_kiwi.png[scaledwidth=80%]

. In the [guimenu]``Label`` field, provide a name for the `Image Profile`.
. Use `Kiwi` as the [guimenu]``Image Type``.
. Image store is automatically selected.
. Enter a [guimenu]``Config URL`` to the directory containing the Kiwi configuration files:
.. git URI
.. HTTPS tarball
.. Path to build host local directory
. Enter [guimenu]``Kiwi options`` if needed.
  If the Kiwi configuration files specify multiple profiles, use [option]``--profile <name>`` to select the active one.
    For other options, see Kiwi documentation.
. Select an [guimenu]``Activation Key``.
  Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages.
+

[NOTE]
====
Associate an activation key with an image profile to ensure the image profile uses the correct software channel, and any packages.
====
+

. Confirm with the btn:[Create] button.


.Source format options
** git/HTTP(S) URL to the repository
+

URL to the git repository containing the sources of the image to be built.
Depending on the layout of the repository the URL can be:
+
----
https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles
----
+

You can specify a branch after the `#` character in the URL.
In this example, we use the `master` branch:
+
----
https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master
----
+

You can specify a directory that contains the image sources after the `:` character.
In this example, we use `OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6`:
+
----
https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master:OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6
----

** HTTP(S) URL to the tarball
+

URL to the tar archive, compressed or uncompressed, hosted on the webserver.
+
----
https://myimagesourceserver.example.org/MyKiwiImage.tar.gz
----

** Path to the directory on the build host
+

Enter the path to the directory with the Kiwi build system sources.
This directory must be present on the selected build host.
+

----
/var/lib/Kiwi/MyKiwiImage
----



[[at.images.kiwi.sourceexample]]
==== Example of Kiwi Sources


Kiwi sources consist at least of `config.xml`.
Usually, `config.sh` and `images.sh` are present as well.
Sources can also contain files to be installed in the final image under the `root` subdirectory.

For information about the Kiwi build system, see the https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/[Kiwi documentation].

{suse} provides examples of fully functional image sources at the https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles[SUSE/manager-build-profiles] public GitHub repository.

[[at.images.kiwi.building]]
=== Build an Image
// ianew: admin/image-management.adoc
// iawho: lana 2019-02-27

There are two ways to build an image using the {webui}.
Either select menu:Images[Build], or click the build icon in the menu:Images[Profiles] list.

image::images_image_build.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Procedure: Building an Image
. Select menu:Images[Build].
. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default ``latest`` (applies only to containers).
. Select the [guimenu]``Image Profile`` and a [guimenu]``Build Host``.
+

[NOTE]
====
A [guimenu]``Profile Summary`` is displayed to the right of the build fields.
When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile is shown here.
====
+

. To schedule a build, click the btn:[Build] button.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The build server cannot run any form of automounter during the image building process.
If applicable, ensure that you do not have your Gnome session running as root.
If an automounter is running, the image build finishes successfully, but the checksum of the image is different and causes a failure.
====


[[at.images.kiwi.inspection]]

After the image is successfully built, the inspection phase begins.
During the inspection phase {susemgr} collects information about the image:

* List of packages installed in the image
* Checksum of the image
* Image type and other image details

[NOTE]
====
If the built image type is `PXE`, a Salt pillar is also generated.
Image pillars are stored in the database and the Salt subsystem can access details about the generated image.
Details include where the image files are located and provided, image checksums, information needed for network boot, and more.

The generated pillar is available to all connected clients.
====



[[at.images.kiwi.troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting


Building an image requires several dependent steps.
When the build fails, investigating Salt states results and build log can help identify the source of the failure.
You can carry out these checks when the build fails:

* The build host can access the build sources
* There is enough disk space for the image on both the build host and the {productname} server
* The activation key has the correct channels associated with it
* The build sources used are valid
* The RPM package with the {productname} public certificate is up to date and available at `/usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm`.
  For more on how to refresh a public certificate RPM, see <<at.images.kiwi.buildhost>>.



[[at.images.kiwi.limitations]]
=== Limitations

The section contains some known issues when working with images.

* HTTPS certificates used to access the HTTP sources or git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file, or configured manually.
* Importing Kiwi-based images is not supported.



[[at.images.listing]]
== List of Built Images


To list available built images select menu:Images[Image List].
A list of all images is displayed.

image::images_list_images.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Displayed data about images includes an image [guimenu]``Name``, its [guimenu]``Version``, [guimenu]``Revision``, and the build [guimenu]``Status``.
You can also see the image update status with a listing of possible patch and package updates that are available for the image.

For OS Images, the [guimenu]``Name`` and [guimenu]``Version`` fields originate from Kiwi sources and are updated at the end of successful build.
During building or after failed build these fields show a temporary name based on profile name.

[guimenu]``Revision`` is automatically increased after each successful build. For OS Images, multiple revisions can co-exist in the store.

For Container Images the store holds only the latest revision.
Information about previous revisions (packages, patches, etc.) are preserved and it is possible to list them with the [guimenu]``Show obsolete`` checkbox.

Clicking the btn:[Details] button on an image provides a detailed view.
The detailed view includes an exact list of relevant patches, list of all packages installed within the image and a build log.

Clicking the btn:[Delete] button deletes the image from the list.
It also deletes the associated pillar, files from OS Image Store and obsolete revisions.

[NOTE]
====
The patch and the package list is only available if the inspect state after a build was successful.
====
