= Example SSO Implementation

In this example, SSO is implemented by exposing three endpoints with {productname}, and using Keycloak as the identity service provider (IdP).

Start by setting up the {productname} Server, and the Keycloak IdP.
Then you can add the endpoints as clients, and create users.

.Procedure: Setting Up the {productname} Server
. On the {productname} Server, open the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file and edit these parameters.
    Replace ``<FQDN>`` with the fully qualified domain name of your {productname} installation:
+
----
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.entityid = <FQDN>/rhn/manager/sso/metadata
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = <FQDN>/rhn/manager/sso/acs
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.single_logout_service.url = <FQDN>/rhn/manager/sso/sls
----
. In the configuration file, determine the three endpoints to expose:
+
----
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.entityid
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.single_sign_on_service.url
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.single_logout_service.url
----
. In the IdP metadata, locate the public x509 certificate.
    It uses this format: ``<IdP_Address>/auth/realms/<Your_Realm>/protocol/saml/descriptor``.
    In the configuration file, specify the public x509 certificate of the IdP:
+
----
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.x509cert
----


When you have prepared the {productname} Server, you can install Keycloak.
You can install Keycloak directly on your machine, or run it in a container.
In this example, we run Keycloak in a Docker container.
For more information about installing Keycloak, see the Keycloak documentation at https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker.



.Procedure: Setting Up the Identity Service Provider
. Install Keycloak in a Docker container, according to the Keycloak documentation.
. Run the container using the ``-td`` argument to ensure the process remains running:
+
----
docker run -td --name=idp -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=<user> -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=<password> quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:9.0.2
----
. Sign in the Keycloak {webui} as a privileged user, and create a realm using these details:
+
* In the ``Name`` field, enter a name for the realm.
    For example, ``SUMA``.
* Toggle the ``Enabled`` switch to ``On``.
* In the ``Endpoints`` field, type ``SAML 2.0 Identity Provider Metadata``.
    This endpoint is ``<IdP_Address>/auth/realms/<Realm_Name>/protocol/saml/descriptor`` which describes the endpoints and certificate in the {productname} configuration file.
// Probably needs more explanation here. --LKB 20200415



When you have Keycloak running and set up, you can add the endpoints.
Keycloak refers to endpoints as clients.



.Procedure: Adding Endpoints as Clients
. In the Keycloak {webui}, create a new client using these details:
+
* In the ``Client ID`` field, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as ``java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.entityid``.
    For example, ``https://<FQDN>/rhn/manager/sso/metadata``.
* In the ``Client Protocol`` field, select ``SAML``.
* Toggle the ``Include AuthnStatement`` switch to ``On``.
* Toggle the ``Sign Assertions`` switch to ``On``.
* In the ``Signature Algorithm`` field, select ``RSA_SHA1``.
* In the ``SAML Signature Key Name`` field, select ``Key ID``.
* In the ``Canonicalization Method`` field, select ``Exclusive``.
. In the ``Fine Grain SAML Endpoint Configuration`` section, add the two endpoints using these details:
+
* In both the ``Assertion Consumer Service`` fields, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as ``java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url``.
    For example, ``https://<FQDN>/rhn/manager/sso/acs``.
* In both the ``Logout Service`` fields, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as ``java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.single_logout_service.url``.
    For example, ``https://<FQDN>/rhn/manager/sso/sls``.

When you have added the endpoints as clients, you can configure the client scope, and map the users between Keycloak and {productname}.



.Procedure: Configuring Client Scope and Mappers
. In the Keycloak {webui}, navigate to the menu:Clients[Client Scopes] tab and assign ``role_list`` as the default client scope.
. Navigate to the menu:Clients[Mappers] tab and add a user attribute ``Uid`` mapper, using the default values.
    This SAML attribute is expected by {productname}.
. Navigate to the menu:Users[Admin] section and create an administrative user.
    This user does not need to match the {productname} administrative user.
. Navigate to the menu:Users[Role Mappings] tab, add a ``uid`` attribute with a value that matches the username of the {productname} administrative user.
. Navigate to the menu:Users[Credentials] tab, and set the same password as used by the {productname} administrative user.
. Save your changes.



When you have completed configuration, you can test that the installation is working as expected.
Restart the {productname} Server to pick up your changes, and navigate to the {productname} {webui}.
If your installation is working correctly, you are redirected to the Keycloak SSO page, where you can authenticate successfully.
