= Authentication With Single Sign-On (SSO)

{productname} supports single sign-on (SSO) by implementing the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML){nbsp}2 protocol.

Single sign-on is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of credentials.
SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
A SAML identity service provider (IdP) provides authentication and authorization services to service providers (SP), such as {productname}.
{productname} exposes three endpoints which must be enabled for single sign-on.

SSO in {productname} supports:

* Log in with SSO.
* Log out with service provider-initiated single logout (SLO), and Identity service provider single logout service (SLS).
* Assertion and nameId encryption.
* Assertion signatures.
* Message signatures with AuthNRequest, LogoutRequest, and LogoutResponses.
* Enable an Assertion consumer service endpoint.
* Enable a single logout service endpoint.
* Publish the SP metadata (which can be signed).

SSO in {productname} does not support:

* Product choosing and implementation for the identity service provider (IdP).
* SAML support for other products (check with the respective product documentation).

For an example implementation of SSO, see xref:administration:auth-methods-sso-example.adoc[].


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you change from the default authentication method to single sign-on, the new SSO credentials apply only to the {webui}.
Client tools such as ``mgr-sync`` or ``spacecmd`` will continue to work with the default authentication method only.
====



== Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have configured an external identity service provider with these parameters.
Check your IdP documentation for instructions.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Your IdP must have a SAML:Attribute containing the username of the IdP user domain, called ``uid``.
The ``uid`` attribute passed in the SAML:Attribute must be created in the {productname} user base before you activate single sign-on.
====


You will need these endpoints:

* Assertion consumer service (or ACS): an endpoint to accept SAML messages to establish a session into the Service Provider.
    The endpoint for ACS in {productname} is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/acs
* Single logout service (or SLS): an endpoint to initiate a logout request from the IdP.
    The endpoint for SLS in {productname} is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/sls
* Metadata: an endpoint to retrieve {productname} metadata for SAML.
    The endpoint for metadata in {productname} is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/metadata

After the authentication with the IdP using the user ``orgadmin`` is successful, you will be logged in into {productname} as the ``orgadmin`` user, provided that the ``orgadmin`` user exists in {productname}.



== Enable SSO

[NOTE]
====
Using SSO is mutually exclusive with other types of authentication: it is either enabled or disabled.
SSO is disabled by default.

.Procedure: Enabling SSO

. If your users do not yet exist in {productname}, create them first.
. Edit [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` and add this line at the end of the file:
+
----
java.sso = true
----
. Find the parameters you want to customize in [path]``/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf``.
    Insert the parameters you want to customize into [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` and prefix them with [literal]``java.sso``.
    For example, in [path]``/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf`` find:
+
----
onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs
----
+
To customize it, create the corresponding option in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` by prefixing the option name with ``java.sso.``:
+
----
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs
----
+
To find all the occurrences you need to change, search in the file for the placeholders [literal]``YOUR-PRODUCT`` and [literal]``YOUR-IDP-ENTITY``.
Every parameter comes with a brief explanation of what it is meant for.
. Restart the spacewalk service to pick up the changes:
+
----
spacewalk-service restart
----

When you visit the {productname} URL, you will be redirected to the IdP for SSO where you will be requested to authenticate.
Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to the {productname} {webui}, logged in as the authenticated user.
If you encounter problems with logging in using SSO, check the {productname} logs for more information.
