= Troubleshooting RPC Connection Timeouts

RPC connections can sometimes time out due to slow networks or a network link going down.
This results in package downloads or batch jobs hanging or taking longer than expected.
You can adjust the maximum time that an RPC connection can take by editing the configuration file.
While this does not resolve networking problems, it does cause a process to fail rather than hang.


.Procedure: Resolving RPC connection timeouts

. On the {productname} Server, open the [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` file and set a maximum timeout value (in seconds):
+
----
server.timeout =`number`
----
. On the {productname} Proxy, open the [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` file and set a maximum timeout value (in seconds):
+
----
proxy.timeout =`number`
----
. On a {sles} client that uses zypper, open the [filename]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` file and set a maximum timeout value (in seconds):
+
----
## Valid values:  [0,3600]
## Default value: 180
download.transfer_timeout = 180
----
. On a {rhel} client that uses yum, open the [filename]``/etc/yum.conf`` file and set a maximum timeout value (in seconds):
+
----
timeout =`number`
----

[NOTE]
====
If you limit RPC timeouts to less than `180` seconds, you risk aborting perfectly normal operations.
