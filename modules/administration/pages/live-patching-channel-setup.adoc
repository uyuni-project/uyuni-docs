= Set up Channels for Live Patching

A reboot is required every time you update the full kernel package.
Therefore, it is important that clients using Live Patching do not have newer kernels available in the channels they are assigned to.
Clients using live patching have updates for the running kernel in the live patching channels.

There are two ways to manage channels for live patching:

Use content lifecycle management to clone the product tree and remove kernel versions newer than the running one.
This procedure is explained in the xref:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#enhance-project-with-livepatching[Content Livecycle Management Examples].
This is the recommended solution.

Alternatively, use the `spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle` tool.
This procedure is more manual and requires command line tools as well as the {webui}.
This procedure is explained in this section for SLES{nbsp}15 SP1, but it also works for SLE{nbsp}12 SP4 or later.



== Use spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle for Live Patching

Cloned vendor channels should be prefixed by ``dev`` for development, ``testing``, or  ``prod`` for production.
In this procedure, you create a ``dev`` cloned channel and then promote the channel to ``testing``.



.Procedure: Cloning Live Patching Channels

. At the command prompt on the client, as root, obtain the current package channel tree:
+

[subs=attributes]
----
# spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --list-channels
Spacewalk Username: admin
Spacewalk Password:
Channel tree:

 1. sles15-{sp-vert}-pool-x86_64
      \__ sle-live-patching15-pool-x86_64-{sp-vert}
      \__ sle-live-patching15-updates-x86_64-{sp-vert}
      \__ sle-manager-tools15-pool-x86_64-{sp-vert}
      \__ sle-manager-tools15-updates-x86_64-{sp-vert}
      \__ sles15-{sp-vert}-updates-x86_64
----

. Use the [command]``spacewalk-manage-channel`` command with the [option]``init`` argument to automatically create a new development clone of the original vendor channel:
+
[subs=attributes]
----
spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --init -c sles15-{sp-vert}-pool-x86_64
----
[subs=attributes]
. Check that [systemitem]``dev-sles15-{sp-vert}-updates-x86_64`` is available in your channel list.

Check the ``dev`` cloned channel you created, and remove any kernel updates that require a reboot.



.Procedure: Removing Non-Live Kernel Patches from Cloned Channels
. Check the current kernel version by selecting the client from menu:Systems[System List], and taking note of the version displayed in the [guimenu]``Kernel`` field.
. In the {productname} {webui}, select the client from menu:Systems[Overview], navigate to the menu:Software[Manage > Channels] tab, and select [systemitem]``dev-sles15-{sp-vert}-updates-x86_64``.
      Navigate to the [guimenu]``Patches`` tab, and click btn:[List/Remove Patches].
. In the search bar, type [systemitem]``kernel`` and identify the kernel version that matches the kernel currently used by your client.
. Remove all kernel versions that are newer than the currently installed kernel.

Your channel is now set up for live patching, and can be promoted to ``testing``.
In this procedure, you also add the live patching child channels to your client, ready to be applied.



.Procedure: Promoting Live Patching Channels
. At the command prompt on the client, as `root`, promote and clone the `dev-sles15-{sp-vert}-pool-x86_64` channel to a new ``testing`` channel:
+
[subs=attributes]
----
# spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --promote -c dev-sles15-{sp-vert}-pool-x86_64
----
. In the {productname} {webui}, select the client from menu:Systems[Overview], and navigate to the menu:Software[Software Channels] tab.
. Check the new [systemitem]``test-sles15-{sp-vert}-pool-x86_64`` custom channel to change the base channel, and check both corresponding live patching child channels.
. Click btn:[Next], confirm that the details are correct, and click btn:[Confirm] to  save the changes.

You can now select and view available CVE patches, and apply these important kernel updates with Live Patching.
