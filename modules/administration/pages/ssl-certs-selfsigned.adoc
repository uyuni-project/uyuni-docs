[[ssl-certs-selfsigned]]
= Self-Signed SSL Certificates

By default, {productname} uses a self-signed certificate.
In this case, the certificate is created and signed by {productname}.
This method does not use an independent certificate authority to guarantee that the details of the certificate are correct.
Third party CAs perform checks to ensure that the information contained in the certificate is correct.
For more on third party CAs, see xref:administration:ssl-certs-imported.adoc[].

This section covers how to re-create your self-signed certificates on an existing installation.
It also covers how to create new self-signed certificates and authenticate your existing clients to the new certificate, using an intermediate certificate.
Intermediate certificates merge the intermediate and root CA certificates into one file.
Ensure that the intermediate certificate comes first in the combined file.

The host name of the SSL keys and certificates must match the fully qualified host name of the machine you deploy them on.



== Re-Create Existing Server Certificates

If your existing certificates have expired or stopped working for any reason, you can generate a new server certificate from the existing CA.

.Procedure: Re-Creating an Existing Server Certificate

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, regenerate the server certificate:
+
----
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir="/root/ssl-build" --set-country="COUNTRY" \
--set-state="STATE" --set-city="CITY" --set-org="ORGANIZATION" \
--set-org-unit="ORGANIZATION UNIT" --set-email="name@example.com" \
--set-hostname="susemanager.example.com" --set-cname="example.com"
----
Ensure that the [systemitem]``set-cname`` parameter is the fully-qualified domain name of your {productname} Server.
You can use the the [systemitem]``set-cname`` parameter multiple times if you require multiple aliases.
. Install the RPM that contains the newly generated certificate.
    Check that you have the latest version of the RPM before running this command.
    The version number is incremented every time you re-create the certificates.
+
----
rpm -Uhv /root/ssl-build/lnx0259a/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-lnx0259a-1.0-2.noarch.rpm
----
. Restart services to pick up the changes:
+
----
spacewalk-service restart
----



[[ssl-certs-selfsigned-create-replace]]
== Create and Replace CA and Server Certificates

If you need to create entirely new certificates for an existing installation, you need to create a combined certificate first.
Clients will authenticate to the certificate with both the old and new details.
Then you can go ahead and remove the old details.
This maintains the chain of trust.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful with this procedure!
It is possible to break the trust chain between the server and clients using this procedure.
If that happens, you will need an administrative user to log in to every client and deploy the CA directly.
====



.Procedure: Creating New Certificates

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, move the old certificate directory to a new location:
+
----
mv /root/ssl-build /root/old-ssl-build
----
. Generate a new CA certificate and create an RPM:
+
----
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-ca --dir="/root/ssl-build" --set-country="COUNTRY" \
--set-state="STATE" --set-city="CITY" --set-org="ORGANIZATION" \
--set-org-unit="ORGANIZATION UNIT" --set-common-name="SUSE Manager CA Certificate" \
--set-email="name@example.com"
----
. Generate a new server certificate and create an RPM:
+
----
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir="/root/ssl-build" --set-country="COUNTRY" \
--set-state="STATE" --set-city="CITY" --set-org="ORGANIZATION" \
--set-org-unit="ORGANIZATION UNIT" --set-email="name@example.com" \
--set-hostname="susemanager.example.top" --set-cname="example.com"
----
Ensure that the [systemitem]``set-cname`` parameter is the fully-qualified domain name of your {productname} Server.
You can use the the [systemitem]``set-cname`` parameter multiple times if you require multiple aliases.
+
You will need to generate a server certificate RPM for each proxy, using their host names and cnames.


When you have new certificates, you can create the combined RPMs to authenticate the clients.



.Procedure: Create Combined Certificate RPMs
. Create a new CA file that combines the old and new certificate details, and generate a new RPM:
+
----
mkdir /root/combined-ssl-build
cp /root/old-ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT /root/combined-ssl-build/
cat /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT >> /root/combined-ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT
cp /root/old-ssl-build/*.rpm /root/combined-ssl-build/
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-ca --rpm-only --dir="/root/combined-ssl-build"
----
// I would like to split up these steps, I think. LKB 2019-09-10
. Deploy the CA certificate on the server:
+
----
/usr/bin/rhn-deploy-ca-cert.pl --source-dir /root/combined-ssl-build \
--target-dir /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ --trust-dir=/etc/pki/trust/anchors/
----

When you have the combined RPMs, you can deploy the combined CA certificates to your clients.



.Procedure: Deploying Combined Certificates on Traditional Clients

. On the client, create a new custom channel using these details:
+
* Name: SSL-CA-Channel
* Label: ssl-ca-channel
* Parent Channel: <choose the parent channel of a client>
* Summary: SSL-CA-Channel

+
For more on creating custom channels, see xref:administration:channel-management.adoc[].
. Upload the CA certificate RPM to the channel:
+
----
rhnpush -c ssl-ca-channel --nosig \
--ca-chain=/srv/www/htdocs/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT \
/root/combined-ssl-build/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-1.0-2.noarch.rpm
----
. Subscribe all clients to the new ``SSL-CA-Channel`` channel.
. Install the CA certificate RPM on all clients by updating the channel.



.Procedure: Deploying Combined Certificates on Salt Clients

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Overview].
. Check all your Salt Clients to add them to the system set manager.
. Navigate to menu:Systems[System Set Manager > Overview].
. In the [guimenu]``States`` field, click btn:[Apply] to apply the system states.
. In the [guimenu]``Highstate`` page, click btn:[Apply Highstate] to propagate the changes to the clients.

When you have every client trusting both the old and new certificates, you can go ahead and replace the server certificate on the {productname} Server and Proxies.



.Procedure: Replace Server Certificate on the Server

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, install the RPM from the [path]``ssl-build`` directory:
+
----
rpm -Uhv ssl-build/susemanager/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-susemanager-1.0-2.noarch.rpm
----
. Restart services to pick the changes:
+
----
spacewalk-service restart
----



.Procedure: Replace Server Certificate on the Proxy

. On the {productname} Proxy, at the command prompt, install the RPM from the [path]``ssl-build`` directory:
+
----
rpm -Uhv ssl-build/susemanager-proxy/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-susemanager-proxy-1.0-2.noarch.rpm
----
. Restart services to pick up the changes:
+
----
rhn-proxy restart
----
. Test that all clients still operate as expected and can use SSL to reach the {productname} Server and any proxies.


When you have replaced the server certificates on your server and any proxies, you need to update the certificate with only the new details on all the clients.
This is done by adding it to the client channels you set up previously.



.Procedure: Adding the New Certificates to the Client Channel

. Copy the combined certificate RPM into the [path]``/root/ssl-build/`` directory:
+
----
cp /root/combined-ssl-build/*.rpm /root/ssl-build/
----
. Generate a new RPM with from the new certificates.
    Check the release number carefully to ensure you have the right certificate file:
+
----
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-ca --rpm-only --dir="/root/ssl-build"
----
. Install the new local certificates on the {productname} Server:
+
----
/usr/bin/rhn-deploy-ca-cert.pl --source-dir /root/ssl-build \
--target-dir /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ --trust-dir=/etc/pki/trust/anchors/
----
. Restart services to pick up the changes:
+
----
spacewalk-service restart
----
. Upload the new RPM into the channel:
+
----
rhnpush -c ssl-ca-channel --nosig \
--ca-chain=/srv/www/htdocs/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT \
/root/ssl-build/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-1.0-3.noarch.rpm
----


When you have the new certificate in the channel, you can use the {productname} {webui} to update it on all clients and proxies, by synchronizing them with the channel.
Alternatively, for Salt clients, you can use menu:Salt[Remote Commands], or apply the highstate.


You will also need to update your proxies to remove the copy of the certificate and the associated RPM.
Your proxies must have the same certificate content as the server.
Check the [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/`` directory and ensure it contains:

----
RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT
rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-*.noarch.rpm
----

To complete the process, you need to update the database with this command:

----
/usr/bin/rhn-ssl-dbstore --ca-cert=/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT
----

If you use bootstrap, remember to also update your bootstrap scripts to reflect the new certificate information.
