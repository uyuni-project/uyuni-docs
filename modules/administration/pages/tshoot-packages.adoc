Packages can sometimes be locked or taskomatic can experience problems, which creates problems with metadata regeneration.
When this occurs, package updates will be available in the {webui}, but will not appear on the client, and attempts to update the client will fail.
To correct this, determine if any processes are running, or if a crash could have occured.
Check package locks and exclude lists to determine if packages are locked or excluded on the client.
When you have located the problematic process, the metadata can be regenerated and synchronization occurs as expected.

.Procedure: Resolving Package Inconsisties

. On the server, check the [path]``/var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`` file to determine if any processes are still running or a crash occured.
. Restart taskomatic:
+
----
/etc/init.d/taskomatic restart
----
+
. Check package locks and exclude lists to determine if packages are locked or excluded on the client:
+
* On Expanded Support Platform, check [path]``/etc/yum.conf`` and search for ``exclude=``.
* On {slsa}, use the [command]``zypper locks`` command.
