= System Security via OpenSCAP


{productname} uses OpenSCAP to audit clients.
It allows you to schedule and view compliance scans for any client.

[NOTE]
====
OpenSCAP auditing is available for use with traditional clients only.
It is not available on Salt clients.
====

To use openSCAP, you will need the [systemitem]``spacewalk-oscap`` package installed on the clients you want to audit.



== About SCAP

The Security Certification and Authorization Package (SCAP) is a standardized compliance checking solution for enterprise-level Linux infrastructures.
It is a line of specifications maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for maintaining system security for enterprise systems.

SCAP was created to provide a standardized approach to maintaining system security, and the standards that are used will therefore continually change to meet the needs of the community and enterprise businesses.
New specifications are governed by NIST's SCAP Release cycle to provide a consistent and repeatable revision work flow.
For more information, see http://scap.nist.gov/timeline.html.

{productname} uses OpenSCAP to implement the SCAP specifications.
OpenSCAP is an auditing tool that utilizes the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF).
XCCDF is a standard way of expressing checklist content and defines security checklists.
It also combines with other specifications such as Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE), and Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL), to create a SCAP-expressed checklist that can be processed by SCAP-validated products.

OpenSCAP verifies the presence of patches by using content produced by the SUSE Security Team (https://www.suse.com/support/security/), checks system security configuration settings and examines systems for signs of compromise by using rules based on standards and specifications.



== OpenSCAPÂ Content Files

OpenSCAP uses SCAP content files to define test rules.
These content files are created based on the XCCDF or OVAL standards.
You can download publicly available content files and customize it to your requirements.
You can install the ``openscap-content`` package for default content file templates.
Alternatively, if you are familiar with XCCDF or OVAL, you can create your own content files.


[WARNING]
====
We recommend you use templates to create your SCAP content files.
If you create and use your own custom content files, you do so at your own risk.
If your system becomes damaged through the use of custom content files, you might not be supported by {suse}.

////
 ke 2013-08-28: Do we have SCAP content providers? Such as: The United States Government
   Configuration Baseline (USGCB) for RHEL5 Desktop or Community-provided content (openscap-content
   package)? For more info, see
   https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite/5.5/html/User_Guide/chap-Red_Hat_Network_Satellite-User_Guide-OpenSCAP.html #
I think this question is still valid. Who should we contact? LKB 2020-02-06
////


When you have created your content files, you need to transfer the file to the client.
You can do this in the same way as you move any other file, using physical storage media, or across a network with [command]``ftp`` or [command]``scp``.

We recommend that you create a package to distribute content files to clients that you are managing with {productname}.
Packages can be signed and verified to ensure their integrity.
For more information, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].


== Audit Scans

// Lana, you're up to here! LKB 2020-02-06

[[pro-os-suma-audit-scans-webui]]
.Procedure: Scans via the Web Interface
. To perform a scan via the Web interface, log in to {productname}.
. Click on menu:Systems[] and select the target system.
. Click on menu:Audit[Schedule].
. Fill in the Schedule New XCCDF Scan form. For more information about the fields on this page, see xref:reference:audit/system-details-audit.adoc#sm-audit-schedule[].

+
WARNING: The XCCDF content is validated before it is run on the remote system.
Specifying invalid arguments can make spacewalk-oscap fail to validate or run.
Due to security concerns the [command]``oscap xccdf eval`` command only accepts a limited set of parameters.
+


+
Run the [command]``mgr_check`` command to ensure the action is being picked up by the client system.
+

----
mgr_check -vv
----
+
NOTE: If the {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) or [command]``osad`` are running on the client system, the action will be picked up by these services.
On systemd-based systems, you can check if they are running with this command:

----
service rhnsd start
----

or

----
service osad start
----
+


// FIXME: this xref will only work if the target is in the same file (or module?).
To view the results of the scan, refer to <<s2-openscap-suma-audit-scans_view>>.

.Scheduling a Scan via the Web Interface

image::audit_openscap_schedule_scan.png[scaledwidth=80%]


.Procedure: Scans via API
. To perform an audit scan via API, choose an existing script or create a script for scheduling a system scan through ``system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan``, the front end API, for example:
+

----
#!/usr/bin/python
client = xmlrpclib.Server('https://spacewalk.example.com/rpc/api')
key = client.auth.login('username', 'password')
client.system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan(key, 1000010001,
    '/usr/local/share/scap/usgcb-sled11desktop-xccdf.xml',
    '--profile united_states_government_configuration_baseline')
----
+
Where:
** `1000010001` is the system ID (sid).
** [path]``/usr/local/share/scap/usgcb-sled11desktop-xccdf.xml`` is the path to the content location on the client system. In this case, it assumes USGCB content in the [path]``/usr/local/share/scap`` directory.
** [option]``--profile united_states_government_configuration_baseline`` is an additional argument for the [command]``oscap`` command. In this case, it is using the USGCB.
. Run the script on the command-line interface of any system. The system needs the appropriate Python and XML-RPC libraries installed.
. Run the [command]``mgr_check`` command to ensure that the action is being picked up by the client system.
+

----
mgr_check -vv
----
+
If the {productname} daemon ([command]``rhnsd``) or [command]``osad`` are running on the client system, the action will be picked up by these services.
To check if they are running, use:
+

----
service rhnsd start
----
+
or
+

----
service osad start
----


.Enabling Upload of Detailed SCAP Files
[NOTE]
====
To make sure detailed information about the scan will be available, activate the upload of detailed SCAP files on the clients to be evaluated.
Navigate to menu:Admin[Organization] and select an organization.
On the menu:Configuration[] tab, check [guimenu]``Enable Upload Of Detailed SCAP Files``.
This feature generates an additional HTML version when you run a scan.
The results will show an extra line like:
+
----
Detailed Results: xccdf-report.html xccdf-results.xml scap-yast2sec-oval.xml.result.xml

== Viewing SCAP Results

There are three methods of viewing the results of finished scans:

* Via the Web interface.
When the scan has finished, results show up on the menu:Audit[] tab of a specific system.
This page is discussed in <<s2-openscap-suma-pages>>.
// ^ FIXME: xref
* Via the API functions in handler ``system.scap``.
* Via the [command]``spacewalk-report`` command as follows:
+

----
spacewalk-report system-history-scap
spacewalk-report scap-scan
spacewalk-report scap-scan-results
