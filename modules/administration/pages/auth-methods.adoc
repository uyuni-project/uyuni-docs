= Authentication Methods

{productname} supports several different authentication methods.
This section discusses pluggable authentication modules (PAM) and single sign-on (SSO).


== Authenticate with PAM

{productname} supports network-based authentication systems using pluggable authentication modules (PAM).
PAM is a suite of libraries that allows you to integrate {productname} with a centralized authentication mechanism, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords.
{productname} supports LDAP, Kerberos, and other network-based authentication systems using PAM.



.Procedure: Enabling PAM

. Create a PAM service file at [path]``/etc/pam.d/susemanager``.
A standard [path]``/etc/pam.d/susemanager`` file should look like this.
It configures {productname} to use the system wide PAM configuration:
+
----
#%PAM-1.0
auth     include        common-auth
account  include        common-account
password include        common-password
session  include        common-session
----
. Enforce the use of the service file by adding this line to [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:
+
----
pam_auth_service = susemanager
----
+
In this example, the PAM service file is called [systemitem]``susemanager``.
. Restart the {productname} services after a configuration change.
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to [menuitem]``Create User`` and enable a new or existing user to authenticate with PAM.
. Check the [guimenu]``Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)`` checkbox.
It is below the password and password confirmation fields.



[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the password in the {productname} {webui} changes only the local password on the {productname} Server.
If PAM is enabled for that user, the local password might not be used at all.
In the above example, for instance, the Kerberos password will not be changed.
Use the password change mechanism of your network service to change the password for these users.
====


To configure system-wide authentication you can use YaST.
You will need to install the [package]``yast2-ldap-client`` and [package]``yast2-kerberos-client`` packages.


For more information about configuring PAM, the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Security Guide contains a generic example that will also work for other network-based authentication methods.
It also describes how to configure an Active Directory Service.
For more information, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/part-auth.html.



== Authenticate with Single Sign-On (SSO)

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is provided as a technical preview.
It is not supported for use in production environments.
====

{productname} supports single sign-on (SSO) by implementing the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML){nbsp}2 protocol.

Single sign-on is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of credentials.
SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data.
A SAML identity service provider (IdP) provides authentication and authorization services to service providers (SP), such as {productname}.
{productname} exposes three endpoints which must be enabled for single sign-on.

SSO in {productname} supports:

* Log in with SSO.
* Log out with service provider-initiated single logout (SLO), and Identity service provider single logout service (SLS).
* Assertion and nameId encryption.
* Assertion signatures.
* Message signatures with AuthNRequest, LogoutRequest, and LogoutResponses.
* Enable an Assertion consumer service endpoint.
* Enable a single logout service endpoint.
* Publish the SP metadata (which can be signed).

SSO in {productname} does not support:

* Product choosing and implementation for the Identity Service Provider (IdP).
* SAML support for other products (check with the respective product documentation).


[IMPORTANT]
====
If you change from the default authentication method to single sign-on, the new SSO credentials apply only to the {webui}.
Client tools such as ``mgr-sync`` or ``spacecmd`` will continue to work with the default authentication method only.
====



=== Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have configured an external Identity Service Provider with these parameters.
Check your IdP documentation for instructions.

You will need these endpoints:

* Assertion Consumer Service (or ACS): an endpoint to accept SAML messages to establish a session into the Service Provider.
The endpoint for ACS in {productname} is: https://example.com/rhn/manager/sso/acs
* Single Logout Service (or SLS): an endpoint to initiate a logout request from the IdP.
The endpoint for SLS in {productname} is: https://example.com/rhn/manager/sso/sls
* Metadata: an endpoint to retrieve {productname} metadata for SAML.
The endpoint for Metadata in {productname} is: https://example.com/rhn/manager/sso/metadata

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your IdP must have a SAML:Attribute containing the username of the IdP user domain, called `uid`.
The `uid` attribute passed in the SAML:Attribute must be created in the {productname} user base before you activate single sign-on.
====

After the authentication with the IdP using the user `orgadmin` is successful, you will be logged in into {productname} as the `orgadmin` user, provided that the `orgadmin` user exists in {productname}.



=== Enable SSO

[NOTE]
====
Using SSO is mutually exclusive with other types of authentication: it is either enabled or disabled.
SSO is disabled by default.
====

.Procedure: Enabling SSO

. If your users do not yet exist in {productname}, create them first.
. Edit `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf` and add this line at the end of the file:
+
----
java.sso = true
----
. Find the parameters you want to customize in `/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf`.
Insert the parameters you want to customize into `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf` and prefix them with `java.sso.`.
+
For example, in `/usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf` find:
+
----
onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs
----
+
In order to customize it, create the corresponding option in `/etc/rhn/rhn.conf` by prefixing the option name with `java.sso.`:
+
----
java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs
----
+
To find all the occurrences you need to change, search in the file for the placeholders [literal]``YOUR-PRODUCT`` and [literal]```YOUR-IDP-ENTITY``.
Every parameter comes with a brief explanation of what it is meant for.
. Restart the spacewalk service to pick up the changes:
+
----
spacewalk-service restart
----

When you visit the {productname} URL, you will be redirected to the IdP for SSO where you will be requested to authenticate.
Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to the {productname} {webui}, logged in as the authenticated user.
If you encounter problems with logging in using SSO, check the {productname} logs for more information.
