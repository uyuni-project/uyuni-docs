== Prepare to Remove a Channel

Before removing a channel, you must identify the label for the channel to be removed.
It can be done with {webui} or on the command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Be careful not to remove channels that systems are currently subscribed to, or that you are planning on subscribing a system to.
* If there are systems that are currently subscribed to a channel that you want to delete, do not remove the channel until those systems are upgraded or unsubscribed.

== Remove Channel

A channel, with its metadata, can be removed with command line tools only.
The [command]``spacewalk-remove-channel`` command automatically removes the software packages, too.
It also removes the metadata from the database and the files from the storage medium.

. To remove an individual channel run the following command on the {productname} container host:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label
----
+
. To remove multiple channels at the same time, use [literal]``-c`` flag for each channel, followed by the [literal]``channel-label``.
  For example:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label1 -c channel-label2
----


=== Remove a Parent and All Its Child Channels

.Procedure: Removing a Parent and All Its Child Channels
