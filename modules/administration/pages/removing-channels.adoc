[[preparing-to-remove-channel]]
== Prepare to Remove a Channel

Before removing a channel, you must identify the label for the channel to be removed.
It can be done with {webui} or on the command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Be careful not to remove channels that systems are currently subscribed to, or that you are planning on subscribing a system to.
* If there are systems that are currently subscribed to a channel that you want to delete, do not remove the channel until those systems are upgraded or unsubscribed.

.Procedure: Identifying Channel Labels Using {webui}
[role=procedure]
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Channel List > All].
. This page displays the [label]``Channel Name``.
  If you select the link for a channel name, you will see the field for [literal]``Channel Label``.
. Identify the channel, and child channels, to be removed.


.Procedure: Identifying Channel Labels Using the Command Line
[role=procedure]

. You can get a list of channels by running the following command on the {productname} container host:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-remove-channel -l
----


===  Verify Channel System Subscriptions

.Procedure: Verifying Channel System Subscriptions Using {webui}

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Channel List > All].

== Remove Channel

A channel, with its metadata, can be removed with command line tools only.
The [command]``spacewalk-remove-channel`` command automatically removes the software packages, if they are not referenced anymore by other channels.
Thus it removes the metadata from the database and the files from the storage medium.



=== Remove a Child Channel

.Procedure: Removing a Child Channel Using the Command Line

. To remove an individual channel run the following command on the {productname} container host:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label
----
+
. To remove multiple channels at the same time, use [literal]``-c`` flag for each channel, followed by the [literal]``channel-label``.
  For example:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label1 -c channel-label2
----


=== Remove a Parent and All Its Child Channels

.Procedure: Removing a Parent and All Its Child Channels
. To remove a parent channel with all of the child channels run [command]``spacewalk-remove-channel`` with the [option]``-a`` option and replace [literal]``parent-channel-label`` with a channel label such as [literal]``sles12-sp5-pool-x86_64``:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti -- spacewalk-remove-channel -a parent-channel-label
----
