If you need to retry setting up the target system, follow these steps:

. Delete [path]``/root/.MANAGER_SETUP_COMPLETE``.
. Stop PostgreSQL and remove [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data``.
. Set the target system hostname to match the source system hostname.
. Check the [path]``/etc/hosts`` file, and correct it if necessary.
. Check [path]``/etc/setup_env.sh`` on the target system, and ensure the database name is set:
+
----
MANAGER_DB_NAME='susemanager'
----
. Reboot the target system.
. Run [command]``mgr-setup`` again.
