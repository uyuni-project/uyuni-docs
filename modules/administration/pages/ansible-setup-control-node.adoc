To set up an Ansible control node, execute the following steps from the {productname} {webui}.

[NOTE]
====

To configure a client as the Ansible Control Node, the Ansible package must be installed on that system.
Usually, the Ansible package should be obtained from the operating system vendor's official repositories.
For example, on {sle} 15 SP6 and SP7, Ansible is available through the [literal]``Systems Management Module.``
====



.Procedure: Setting up Ansible Control Node on a {sle} 15 SP6 or SP7 system
[role=procedure]
____
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Products], verify that [literal]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 x86_64`` (or later) with the [literal]``Systems Management Module`` and the required [literal]``Python 3 Module`` are selected and synchronized.

. Deploy a {sle} 15 SP6 (or later) client.

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to the menu:Systems[Overview] page of the client.
  Select menu:Software[Software Channels] and subscribe the client to the [literal]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 x86_64`` (or later SP), [literal]``Systems Management Module`` and  [literal]``Python 3 Module`` channels.

. Select menu:Details[Properties] of your client.
  From the [literal]``Add-On System Types`` list enable [guimenu]``Ansible Control Node`` and click btn:[Update Properties].

. Navigate to the client overview page, select menu:State[Highstate], and click btn:[Apply Highstate].

. Select the menu:Events[] tab and verify the status of the highstate.
____
====
If you want to install a newer Ansible on a {sle} 15 SP4 or SP5 client, you must enable the [literal]``Python 3 Module``.
====

[NOTE]
====
Newer versions of Ansible no longer support managing nodes with outdated Python versions.
If a managed node still defaults to an older Python version, you may encounter connection errors or failures during playbook runs.
To address this, user should upgrade Python on the managed node, if possible and set the correct Python interpreter in the Ansible inventory or configuration.

[[configure-ansible-inventory-files]]
== Create Ansible Inventory Files


Ansible Integration tools deploy a playbook as an inventory file.
Create one inventory file for each operating system listed in _Table 1_.

.Procedure: Creating Ansible Inventory Files
[role=procedure]
____
. Create and add your hosts to an inventory file to be managed by Ansible.
  The default path for an Ansible inventory is [path]``/etc/ansible/hosts``.
+

.Inventory Example
----
client240.mgr.example.org
client241.mgr.example.org
client242.mgr.example.org
client243.mgr.example.org ansible_ssh_public_key_file=/etc/ansible/some_ssh_key

[mygroup1]
client241.mgr.example.org
client242.mgr.example.org

[mygroup2]
client243.mgr.example.org

[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_public_key_file=/etc/ansible/my_ansible_public_key
----



. In the {productname} {webui}, from the [guimenu]``Ansible`` tab navigate to menu:Ansible[Control Node] to add inventory files to the control node.

. Under the [literal]``Playbook Directories`` section add [literal]``/usr/share/scap-security-guide/ansible`` to the [literal]``Add a Playbook Directories`` field and click btn:[Save].

. Under [literal]``Inventory Files`` add your inventory file locations to the [literal]``Add an Inventory file`` field and click btn:[Save].
+
.Examples
----
/etc/ansible/sles15
/etc/ansible/sles12
/etc/ansible/centos7
----
+

For additional playbook examples, see https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples.
____

.Procedure: Establishing Communication with Ansible Nodes
. Create the SSH keys that you are using in your inventory.
+

----
ssh-keygen -f /etc/ansible/my_ansible_public_key
----

. Copy the generated SSH keys to the Ansible managed clients.
  Example:
+
----
ssh-copy-id -i /etc/ansible/my_ansible_public_key root@client240.mgr.example.org
----

. Declare the public key in [path]``/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`` as follows:
+

----
public_key_file = /etc/ansible/my_ansible_public_key
----
+

Replace [path]``my_ansible_public_key`` with the name of the file containing the public key.

. Test that Ansible is working by executing the following commands from the control node:
+

----
ansible all -m ping
ansible mygroup1 -m ping
ansible client240.mgr.example.org -m ping
----

You may now run remediations.

// bsc#1213077 #9
// section on how to create playbooks, and how to schedule their execution.
// Add a description of the "Playbooks" tab, in general context.
// There is a very summarized descriptions in next section "Compliance as code", but we // need a description of the playbooks tab that is independent of usage with openscap.
