[[maintenance-windows]]
= Maintenance Windows in {productname}

The maintenance windows feature in {productname} allows you to schedule actions to occur during a scheduled maintenance window period.
When you have created your maintenance window schedule, and applied it to a client, you are prevented from executing some actions outside of the specified period.


[NOTE]
====
Maintenance windows operate in a different way to system locking.
System locks are switched on or off as required, while maintenance windows define periods of time when actions are allowed.
Additionally, the allowed and restricted actions differ.
For more information about system locks, see xref:client-configuration:system-locking.adoc[].
====


Maintenance windows require both a calendar, and a schedule.
The calendar defines the date and time of your maintenance window events, including recurring events, and must be in [path]``ical`` format.
The schedule uses the events defined in the calendar to create the maintenance windows.
You must create an [path]``ical`` file for upload, or link to an [path]``ical`` file to create the calendar, before you can create the schedule.

When you have created the schedule, you can assign it to clients that are registered to the {productname} Server.
Clients that have a maintenance schedule assigned cannot run restricted actions outside of maintenance windows.

Restricted actions significantly modify the client, and could potentially cause the client to stop running.
Some examples of restricted actions are:

* Package installation
* Client upgrade
* Product migration
* Highstate application (for Salt clients)

Unrestricted actions are minor actions that are considered safe and are unlikely to cause problems on the client.
Some examples of unrestricted actions are:

* Package profile update
* Hardware refresh
* Subscribing to software channels


Before you begin, you must create an [path]``ical`` file for upload, or link to an [path]``ical`` file to create the calendar.
You can create [path]``ical`` files in your preferred calendaring tool, such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, or KOrganizer.



.Procedure: Uploading a New Maintenance Calendar
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Schedule[Maintenance Windows > Calendars], and click btn:[Create].
. In the [guimenu]``Calendar Name`` section, type a name for your calendar.
. Either provide a URL to your [path]``ical`` file, or upload the file directly.
. Click btn:[Create Calendar] to save your calendar.



.Procedure: Creating a New Schedule
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Schedule[Maintenance Windows > Schedules], and click btn:[Create].
. In the [guimenu]``Schedule Name`` section, type a name for your schedule.
. OPTIONAL: If your [path]``ical`` file contains events that apply to more than one schedule, check [guimenu]``Multi``.
. Select the calendar to assign to this schedule.
. Click btn:[Create Schedule] to save your schedule.



.Procedure: Assigning a Schedule to a Client
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Systems List], select the client to be assigned to a schedule, locate the [guimenu]``System Properties`` panel, and click btn:[Edit These Properties].
    Alternatively, you can assign clients through the system set manager by navigating to menu:Systems[System Set Manager] and using the menu:Misc[Maintenance Windows] tab.
. In the [guimenu]``Edit System Details`` page, locate the [guimenu]``Maintenance Schedule`` field, and select the name of the schedule to be assigned.
. Click btn:[Update Properties] to assign the maintenance schedule.

[NOTE]
====
When you assign a new maintenance schedule to a client, it is possible that the client might already have some restricted actions scheduled, and that these might now conflict with the new maintenance schedule.
If this occurs, the {webui} displays an error and you cannot assign the schedule to the client.
To resolve this, check the btn:[Cancel affected actions] option when you assign the schedule.
This cancels any previously scheduled actions that conflict with the new maintenance schedule.
====


When you have created your maintenance windows, you can schedule restricted actions, such as package upgrades, to be performed during the maintenance window.



.Procedure: Scheduling a Package Upgrade
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System List], select the client you want to upgrade, and go to the menu:Software[Packages > Upgrade] tab.
. Select the package to upgrade from the list, and click btn:[Upgrade Packages].
. In the [guimenu]``Maintenance Window`` field, select which maintenance window the client should use to perform the upgrade.
. Click btn:[Confirm] to schedule the package upgrade.



== Maintenance Schedule Types

When you create a calendar, it contains a number of events, which can be either one-time events, or recurring events.
Each event contains a ``summary`` field.
If you want to create multiple maintenance schedules for one calendar, you can specify events for each using the ``summary`` field.

For example, you might like to create a schedule for production servers, and a different schedule for testing servers.
In this case, you would specify ``SUMMARY: Production Servers`` on events for the production servers, and ``SUMMARY: Testing Servers`` on events for the testing servers.

There are two types of schedule: single, or multi.
If your calendar contains events that apply to more than one schedule, then you must select ``multi``, and ensure you name the schedule according to the ``summary`` field you used in the calendar file.



.Procedure: Creating a Multi Schedule
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Schedule[Maintenance Windows > Schedules], and click btn:[Create].
. In the [guimenu]``Schedule Name`` section, type the name for your schedule.
    Ensure it matches the ``summary`` field of the calendar.
. Check the [guimenu]``Multi`` option.
. Select the calendar to assign to this schedule.
. Click btn:[Create Schedule] to save your schedule.
. To create the next schedule, click btn:[Create].
. In the [guimenu]``Schedule Name`` section, type the name for your second schedule.
    Ensure it matches the ``summary`` field of the second calendar.
. Check the [guimenu]``Multi`` option.
. Click btn:[Create Schedule] to save your schedule.
. Repeat for each schedule you need to create.



== Restricted and Unrestricted Actions

This sections contains a complete list of restricted and unrestricted actions.

Restricted actions significantly modify the client, and could potentially cause the client to stop running.
Restricted actions can only be run during a maintenance window.
The restricted actions are:

* Package operations (for example, installing, updating, or removing packages)
* Patch updates
* Rebooting a client
* Rolling back transactions
* Configuration management changing tasks
* Applying a highstate (for Salt clients)
* Autoinstallation and reinstallation
* Remote commands
* Product migrations
* Cluster operations

[NOTE]
====
For Salt clients, it is possible to run remote commands directly at any time by navigating to menu:Salt[Remote Commands].
This applies whether or not the Salt client is in a maintenance window.
For more information about remote commands, see xref:administration:actions.adoc[].
====

Unrestricted actions are minor actions that are considered safe and are unlikely to cause problems on the client.
If an action is not restricted it is, by definition, unrestricted, and can be be run at any time.
