If you are using {productname} to manage virtual machines, you might find it useful to create clones of your VMs.
A clone is a VM that uses a primary disk that is an exact copy of an existing disk.

While cloning VMs can save you a lot of time, the duplicated identifying information on the disk can sometimes cause problems.

If you have a client that is already registered, you create a clone of that client, and then try and register the clone, you probably want {productname} to register them as two separate clients.
However, if the machine ID in both the original client and the clone is the same, {productname} will register both clients as one system, and the existing client data will be over-written with that of the clone.

This can be resolved by changing the machine ID of the clone, so that {productname} recognizes them as two different clients.

[NOTE]
====
Each step of this procedure is performed on the cloned client.
This procedure does not manipulate the original client, which will still be registered to {productname}.

.Procedure: Resolving Duplicate Machine IDs in Cloned Salt Clients

. On the cloned machine, change the hostname and IP addresses.
    Make sure [path]``/etc/hosts`` contains the changes you made and the correct host entries.
. For distributions that support systemd: If your machines have the same machine ID, delete the file on each duplicated client and re-create it:
+
----
# rm /etc/machine-id
# rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
# dbus-uuidgen --ensure
# systemd-machine-id-setup
----

. For distributions that do not support systemd: Generate a machine ID from dbus:
+
----
# rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
# dbus-uuidgen --ensure
----
. If your clients still have the same Salt client ID, delete the [path]``minion_id`` file on each client (FQDN will be used when it is regenerated on client restart):
+
----
# rm /etc/salt/minion_id
----
. Delete accepted keys from the onboarding page and the system profile from {productname}, and restart the client with:
+
----
# service salt-minion restart
----
. Re-register the clients.
    Each client will now have a different [path]``/etc/machine-id`` and should be correctly displayed on the [guimenu]``System Overview`` page.



.Procedure: Resolving Duplicate Machine IDs in Cloned Traditional Clients

. On the cloned machine, change the hostname and IP addresses.
    Make sure [path]``/etc/hosts`` contains the changes you made and the correct host entries.
. Stop the [systemitem]``rhnsd`` daemon, on {rhnminrelease6} and {sle}Â 11 with:
+
----
# /etc/init.d/rhnsd stop
----
+
or, on newer systemd-based systems, with:
+
----
# service rhnsd stop
----
. Stop [systemitem]``osad`` with:
+
----
# /etc/init.d/osad stop
----
+
or:
+
----
# service osad stop
----
+
or:
+
----
# rcosad stop
----
. Remove the [systemitem]``osad`` authentication configuration file and the system ID:
+
----
# rm -f /etc/sysconfig/rhn/{osad-auth.conf,systemid}
----
. Delete the files containing the machine IDs:
+
* SLES{nbsp}12:
+
----
# rm /etc/machine-id
# rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
# dbus-uuidgen --ensure
# systemd-machine-id-setup
----
* SLES{nbsp}11:
+
----
# suse_register -E
----
. Remove the credential files:
* SLES clients:
+
----
# rm -f /etc/zypp/credentials.d/{SCCcredentials,NCCcredentials}
----
* {rhel} clients:
+
----
# rm  -f /etc/NCCcredentials
----
. Re-run the bootstrap script.
    You should now see the cloned system in {productname} without overriding the system it was cloned from.
