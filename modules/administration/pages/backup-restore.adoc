[[backup-restore]]
= Backup and Restore

Back up your {productname} installation regularly, to prevent data loss.
Because {productname} relies on a database as well as the installed program and configurations, it is important to back up all components of your installation.
This chapter contains information on the files you need to back up, and introduces the [command]``smdba`` tool to manage database backups.
It also contains information about restoring from your backups in the case of a system failure.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Regardless of the backup method you use, you must have available at least three times the amount of space your current installation uses.
Running out of space can result in backups failing, so check this often.
====

The following section describes backing up data within the {productname} container.



[[backup-restore-product]]
== Back up {productname}

The most comprehensive method for backing up your {productname} installation is to back up the relevant files and directories.
This can save you time in administering your backup, and can be faster to reinstall and re-synchronize in the case of failure.
However, this method requires significant disk space and could take a long time to perform the backup.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to back up only the required files and directories, use the following list.
To make this process simpler, and more comprehensive, we recommend backing up the entire [path]``/etc`` and [path]``/root`` directories within the container, not just the ones specified here.
Some files only exist if you are actually using the related {productname} feature.
====


* [path]``/etc/cobbler/``
* [path]``/etc/dhcp.conf``
* [path]``/etc/fstab`` and any ISO mount points you require.
+
If your UUID has changed, ensure you have updated the ``fstab`` entries  accordingly.
* [path]``/etc/rhn/``
* [path]``/etc/salt``
* [path]``/etc/sudoers``
* [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/``
* [path]``/root/.gnupg/``
* [path]``/root/.ssh``
+
This file exists if you are using an SSH tunnel or SSH [command]``push``.
You also need to have saved a copy of the ``id-susemanager`` key.
* [path]``/root/ssl-build/``
* [path]``/srv/formula_metadata``
* [path]``/srv/pillar``
* [path]``/srv/salt``
* [path]``/srv/susemanager``
* [path]``/srv/tftpboot/``
* [path]``/srv/www/cobbler``
* [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/``
* [path]``/srv/www/os-images``
* [path]``/var/cache/rhn``
* [path]``/var/cache/salt``
* [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/``
* [path]``/var/lib/cobbler/templates/`` (before version 4.0 it is [path]``/var/lib/rhn/kickstarts/``)
* [path]``/var/lib/Kiwi``
* [path]``/var/lib/rhn/``
* [path]``/var/run/pgsql/``
* [path]``/var/lib/salt/``
* [path]``/var/run/salt/``
* [path]``/var/spacewalk/``
* Any directories containing custom data such as scripts, Kickstart or AutoYaST profiles, and custom RPMs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You also need to back up your database, which you can do with the [command]``smdba`` tool.

.Procedure: Restoring from a Manual Backup
. On the container host, as root, re-deploy the {productname} Server with ``mgradm install podman``.

. Re-synchronize your {productname} repositories using either the {productname} {webui}, or with the [command]``mgr-sync`` tool at the command prompt in the container.
  You can choose to re-register your product, or skip the registration and SSL certificate generation sections.
. In the container, re-install the [path]``/root/ssl-build/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-MACHINE_NAME-VER-REL.noarch.rpm`` package.
. Schedule the re-creation of search indexes next time the [command]``rhn-search`` service is started.
  This command produces only debug messages, it does not produce error messages.
  In the container, enter:
+

----
rhn-search cleanindex
----

. On the container host, check whether you need to restore [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/``.
  If [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/`` was not in your backup, you need to restore it.
  If the source repository is available, you can restore [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/` with a complete channel synchronization:
+

----
mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels
----



[[backup.smdba.admin]]
== Administering the Database with smdba

The [command]``smdba`` tool is used for managing a local PostgreSQL database.
It allows you to back up and restore your database, and manage backups.
It can also be used to check the status of your database, and perform administration tasks, such as restarting.
For more information about the [command]``smdba``  tool, see xref:reference:cli-smdba[].


The [command]``smdba`` tool works with local PostgreSQL databases only, it does not work with remotely accessed databases, or Oracle databases.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To access a shell inside the Server container, run [literal]``mgrctl term`` on the container host.
From there, one can run the CLI tools as usual.
====


Check the runtime status of the database with:

----
smdba db-status
----

This command returns either ``online`` or ``offline``, for example:

----
Checking database core...       online
----

Starting and stopping the database can be performed with:

----
smdba db-start
----

And:

----
smdba db-stop
----



[[backup.smdba.backup]]
== Database Backup with smdba

The [command]``smdba`` tool performs a continuous archiving backup.
This backup method combines a log of every change made to the database during the current session, with a series of more traditional backup files.
When a crash occurs, the database state is first restored from the most recent backup file on disk, then the log of the current session is replayed exactly, to bring the database back to a current state.
A continuous archiving backup with [command]``smdba`` is performed with the database running, so there is no need for downtime.

This method of backing up is stable and generally creates consistent snapshots, however it can take up a lot of storage space.
Ensure you have at least three times the current database size of space available for backups.
You can check your current database size by navigating to [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/`` and running [command]``df -h``.

The [command]``smdba`` tool also manages your archives, keeping only the most recent backup, and the current archive of logs.
The log files can only be a maximum file size of 16{nbsp}MB, so a new log file is created when the files reach this size.
Every time you create a new backup, previous backups are purged to release disk space.
We recommend you use systemd timer on host system to schedule your [command]``smdba`` backups to ensure that your storage is managed effectively, and you always have a backup ready in case of failure.



=== Perform a Manual Database Backup

[IMPORTANT]
====
To access a shell inside the Server container, run [literal]``mgrctl term`` on the container host.
From there, run command line tools as usual.
====

The [command]``smdba`` tool can be run in the container shell.
We recommend you run a manual database backup immediately after installation, or if you have made any significant changes to your configuration.

[NOTE]
====
When [command]``smdba`` is run for the first time, or if you have changed the location of the backup, it needs to restart your database before performing the archive.
This results in a small amount of downtime.
Regular database backups do not require any downtime.
====

.Procedure: Performing a Manual Database Backup
. Allocate permanent storage space for your backup.
  This example, in the container, uses a directory located at [path]``/var/spacewalk/``.
  This becomes a permanent target for your backup, so ensure it remains accessible by your server at all times.
  This directory is on persistent storage, and for more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/persistent-container-volumes.adoc[].
. At the command prompt of the {productname} container host, as root, enter the server container:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl term
----

. Inside the container, execute the following steps:

+

--
.. In your backup location, create a directory for the backup:

+

As root:

+

[source,shell]
----
install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup
----

.. To create a backup for the first time, run the [command]``smdba backup-hot`` command with the [option]``enable`` option set.
  This creates the backup in the specified directory, and, if necessary, restart the database:

+

[source,shell]
----
smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup
----

+

This command produces debug messages and finishes sucessfully with the output:

+

----
INFO: Finished
----

.. Check that the backup files exist in the [path]``/var/spacewalk/db-backup`` directory, to ensure that your backup has been successful.

[[smdba.automatic.backup.with.cron]]
=== Scheduling Automatic Backups

You do not need to shut down your system to perform a database backup with [command]``smdba``.
However, because it is a large operation, database performance can slow down while the backup is running.
We recommend you schedule regular database backups for a low-traffic period, to minimize disruption.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure you have at least three times the current database size of space available for backups.
You can check your current database size by running on the container host:

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl exec "df -h /var/lib/pgsql"
----
====


.Procedure: Creating a directory for the backup (do it only once)

. At the command prompt of the {productname} container host, as root, enter the server container:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl term
----

. Inside the container, execute the following steps:

+

--
.. In your backup location, create a directory for the backup.
   As root, enter:

+

[source,shell]
----
install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup
----

--


.Procedure: Scheduling Automatic Backups
. On the container host, as root, create a system unit file at [path]``/etc/systemd/system/server-db-backup.service`` with the content:

+

----
[Unit]
Description="Server backup service"

[Service]
ExecStart=mgrctl exec "smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup"
----

. Create a systemd timer file at [path]``/etc/systemd/system/server-db-backup.timer`` with the content:

+

----
[Unit]
Description="Run server database backup relative to activation time"

[Timer]
OnCalendar=Mon..Sun *-*-* 2:00:00
Unit=server-db-backup.service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

+

. Check that all configuration are correct:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemd-analyze verify /etc/systemd/system/server-db-backup.*
----

. Enable the timer:

+

[source,shell]
----
systemctl enable --now server-db-backup.timer
----



[[backup.smdba.restore]]
== Restore from Backup

The [command]``smdba`` tool can be used to restore from backup in the case of failure.



.Procedure: Restoring from Backup
. At the command prompt of the {productname} container host, as root, enter the server container:

+

[source,shell]
----
mgrctl term
----

. Inside the container, execute the following steps:

+

--
.. Shut down the database:

+

[source,shell]
----
smdba db-stop
----

.. Start the restore process and wait for it to complete:

+

[source,shell]
----
smdba backup-restore start
----

.. Restart the database:

+

[source,shell]
----
smdba db-start
----

.. Check if there are differences between the RPMs and the database.

+

[source,shell]
----

[[config-smdb.archivelog]]
== Archive Log Settings

Archive logging allows the database management tool [command]``smdba`` to perform hot backups.
In {productname} with an embedded database, archive logging is enabled by default.

PostgreSQL maintains a limited number of archive logs.
Using the default configuration, approximately 64 files with a size of 16 MiB are stored.

// FIXME: Use sle 15 channels as an example
Creating a user and syncing the channels:

* SLES12-SP2-Pool-x86_64
* SLES12-SP2-Updates-x86_64
* SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool-x86_64-SP2
* SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates-x86_64-SP2

PostgreSQL generates an additional roughly 1 GB of data.
So it is important to think about a backup strategy and create a backups in a regular way.

Archive logs are stored, inside the container, at [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog/`` (postgresql).



[[config-smdb.spaces]]
== Retrieve an Overview of Occupied Database Space

Database administrators may use the subcommand [command]``space-overview`` to get a report about occupied table spaces, for example:

----
mgrctl exec smdba space-overview
----

outputs:

----
SUSE Manager Database Control. Version 1.5.2
Copyright (c) 2012 by SUSE Linux Products GmbH

Tablespace  | Size (Mb) | Avail (Mb) | Use %
------------+-----------+------------+------

susemanager | 776       | 48399      | 1.602
----

The [command]``smdba`` command is available for PostgreSQL.
For a more detailed report, use the [command]``space-tables`` subcommand.
It lists the table and its size, for example:

----
mgrctl exec smdba space-tables
----

outputs:

db_backend = postgresql
db_user = susemanager
db_password = susemanager
db_name = susemanager
db_host = localhost
