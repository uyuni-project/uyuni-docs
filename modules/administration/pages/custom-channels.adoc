= Custom Channels

Custom channels give you the ability to create your own software packages and repositories, which you can use to update your clients.
They also allow you to use software provided by third party vendors in your environment.

You must have administrator privileges to be able to create and manage custom channels.

Before you create a custom channel, determine which base channel you want to associate it with, and which repositories you want to use for content.

This section gives more detail on how to create, administer, and delete custom channels.



== Creating Custom Channels

If you have custom software packages that you need to install on your {productname} systems, you can create a custom child channel to manage them.
You will need to create the channel in the {productname} {webui} and create a repository for the packages, before assigning the channel to your systems.

You can select a vendor channel as the base channel if you want to use packages provided by a vendor.
Alternatively, select ``none`` to make your custom channel a base channel.

Custom channels will sometimes require additional security settings.
Many third party vendors secure packages with GPG.
If you want to use GPG-protected packages in your custom channel, you will need to trust the GPG key which has been used to sign the metadata.
You can then check the [guimenu]``Has Signed Metadata?`` check box to match the package metadata against the trusted GPG keys.
// We need to create a section on importing GPG keys and change this to point there: https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk/issues/9474 LKB 2019-09-18
For more information on importing GPG keys, see xref:reference:systems/autoinst-gpg-and-ssl-keys.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system.
====



.Procedure: Creating a Custom Channel

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], and click btn:[Create Channel].
. On the [guimenu]``Create Software Channel`` page, give your channel a name (for example, [systemitem]``My Tools SLES 15 SP1 x86_64``) and a label (for example, [systemitem]``my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64``).
Labels must not contain space characters or capital letters.
. In the [guimenu]``Parent Channel`` drop down, choose the relevant base channel (for example, [systemitem]``SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64``).
Ensure that you choose the compatible parent channel for your packages.
. In the [guimenu]``Architecture`` drop down, choose the appropriate hardware architecture (for example, [systemitem]``x86_64``).
. Provide any additional information in the contact details, channel access control, and GPG fields, as required for your environment.
. Click btn:[Create Channel].



.Procedure: Creating a Software Repository

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Repositories], and click btn:[Create Repository].
. On the [guimenu]``Create Repository`` page, give your repository a label (for example, [systemitem]``my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo``).
. In the [guimenu]``Repository URL`` field, provide the path to the directory with the [path]``repodata`` file (for example, [systemitem]``file:///opt/mytools/``).
You can use any valid addressing protocol in this field.
. Uncheck the [guimenu]``Has Signed Metadata?`` check box.
. OPTIONAL: Complete the SSL fields if your repository requires client certificate authentication.
. Click btn:[Create Repository].



.Procedure: Assigning the Repository to a Channel
// The UI has changed, and this is no longer accurate. --LKB 2020-05-21
. Assign your new repository to your custom channel by navigating to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], clicking the name of your newly created custom channel, and navigating to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab.
. Ensure the repository you want to assign to the channel is checked, and click btn:[Update Repositories].
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` tab and click btn:[Sync Now] to synchronize immediately.
You can also set an automated synchronization schedule on this tab.



.Procedure: Adding Custom Channels to an Activation Key

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys], and select the key you want to add the custom channel to.
. On the [guiemnu]``Details`` tab, in the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` listing, select the channel to associate.
You can select multiple channels, if you need to.
. Click btn:[Update Activation Key].



== Deleting Custom Channels

You cannot delete {productname} channels with the {webui}.
Only custom channels can be deleted.

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], and select the channel you want to delete.
. Click btn:[Delete software channel].
. On the [guimenu]``Delete Channel`` page, check the details of the channel you are deleting, and check the [guimenu]``Unsubscribe Systems`` checkbox to remove the custom channel from any systems that might still be subscribed.
. Click btn:[Delete Channel].

When channels are deleted, the packages that are part of the deleted channel are not automatically removed.
You will not be able to update packages that have had their channel deleted.

You can delete packages that are not associated with a channel in the {productname} {webui}.
Navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Packages], check the packages to remove, and click btn:[Delete Packages].

[NOTE]
.GPG Key URL
====
The GPG key URL may be either an internal file location such as `file:///` or you may use an external URL.
====

To create a new channel, click the [guimenu]``Create Channel`` link.
Select the appropriate options for the new channel, including base architecture and GPG options, then click btn:[Create Channel].
Note that a channel created in this manner is blank, containing no packages.
You must either upload software packages or add packages from other repositories.
You may also choose to include patches in your custom channel.

[IMPORTANT]
.Enable GPG Check
====
`Enable GPG Check` is automatically selected when creating a new channel.
If you would like to add custom packages and applications to your channel, make sure you deselect this box or you cannot install/add unsigned packages.
Keep in mind this is a security risk for packages from an untrusted source.
====



[[channel.mgmt.cdetails.manage]]
=== Managers

{productname} administrators and channel administrators may alter or delete any channel.

[WARNING]
====
If you delete a channel that has been assigned to a set of clients, it will trigger an immediate update of the channel state for any clients associated with the deleted channel.
This is to ensure that the changes are reflected accurately in the repository file.
====

To grant other users rights to alter or delete this channel, check the box next to the user's name and click btn:[Update].

To allow all users to manage the channel, click the btn:[Select All] button at the bottom of the list then click btn:[Update].
To remove a user's right to manage the channel, uncheck the box next to their name and click btn:[Update].



[[s4-chnlmgmt-cdetails-errata]]
=== Patches

Channel managers can list, remove, clone, and add patches to their custom channel.
Custom channels not cloned from a distribution may not contain patches until packages are available.
Only patches that match the base architecture and apply to a package in that channel may be added.
Finally, only cloned or custom patches may be added to custom channels.
Patches may be included in a cloned channel if they are selected during channel creation.

The [guimenu]``Sync`` tab lists patches that were updated since they were originally cloned in the selected cloned channel.
More specifically, a patch is listed here if and only if:

* it is a cloned patch,
* it belongs to the selected cloned channel,
* it has already been published in the selected cloned channel,
* it does not contain a package that the original patch has, or it has at least one package with a different version with regard to the corresponding one in the original patch, or both.


* Clicking the btn:[Sync Patches] button opens a confirmation page in which a subset of those patches can be selected for synchronization.
* Clicking the btn:[Confirm] button in the confirmation page results in such patches being copied over from the original channel to the cloned channel, thus updating corresponding packages.



[[s4-cnlmgmt-cdetails-pkgs]]
=== Packages

As with patches, administrators can list, remove, compare, and add packages to a custom channel.

To list all packages in the channel, click the [guimenu]``List / Remove Packages`` link.
Check the box to the left of any package you want to remove, then click btn:[Remove Packages].

To add packages, click the [guimenu]``Add Packages`` link.
From the drop-down box activate a channel from which to add packages and click btn:[View] to continue.
Check the box to the left of any package you want to add to the custom channel, then click btn:[Add Packages].

To compare packages in the current channel with those in another, select a channel from the drop-down box and click btn:[Compare].
Packages in both channels are compared, including architecture and the latest version of packages.
The results are displayed on the next screen.

To make the two channels identical, click the btn:[Merge Differences] button.
In the next dialog, resolve any conflicts. btn:[Preview Merge] allows you to review the changes before applying them to the channels.
Select those packages that you want to merge.
Click btn:[Merge Packages] then btn:[Confirm] to perform the merge.



[[s4-chnlmgmt-cdetails-repos]]
=== Repositories

On the [guimenu]``Repositories`` page, assign software repositories to the channel and synchronize repository content:

* [guimenu]``Add/Remove`` lists configured repositories, which can be added and removed by selecting the check box next to the repository name and clicking btn:[Update Repositories].
* [guimenu]``Sync`` lists configured repositories. The synchronization schedule can be set using the drop-down boxes, or an immediate synchronization can be performed by clicking btn:[Sync Now].

The [guimenu]``Manage Repositories`` tab to the left shows all assigned repositories.
Click a name to see details and possibly delete a repository.

[IMPORTANT]
.Channel with multiple repositories and comps files
====
Some repositories have a comps file associated with them.
Comps files are used to define how packages are grouped within the repository.
If you are synchronizing multiple repositories within the same channel, the comps file of the most recently synchronized repository will be used for the entire channel.
If you want to access all your repository comps files, you will need to map each repository to a different channel.
