= Generate Reports

{productname} allows the user to produce a variety of reports.
These reports can be helpful for taking inventory of your subscribed systems, users, and organizations.
Using reports is often simpler than gathering information manually from the {productname} {webui}, especially if you have many systems under management.

While the command line tool [command]``spacewalk-report`` can be used to generate pre-configured reports, with the introduction of the xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-reporting.adoc[Hub Reporting] it is also possible to generate fully customized reports.
This can be achieved by connecting any reporting tool that supports the SQL language to the reporting database and extract the data directly.
For more information about the data availability and structure, see the reporting database schema documentation.

== Using ``spacewalk-report``

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use [literal]``mgrctl term`` before running steps inside the server container.
====

To generate reports, you must have the [package]``spacewalk-reports`` package installed.
The [command]``spacewalk-report`` command allows you to organize and display reports about content, systems, and user resources across {productname}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to the introduction of xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-reporting.adoc[Hub Reporting], [command]``spacewalk-report`` now gathers by default the data from the reporting database. See <<spacewalk-report-reporting-db>> for more information.
====

You can generate reports on:

System Inventory::
List all the systems registered to {productname}.

Patches:: 
List all the patches relevant to the registered systems.
You can sort patches by severity, as well as the systems that apply to a particular patch.

Users:: 
List all registered users and any systems associated with a particular user.

To get the report in CSV format, run this command at the command prompt on the server:

spacewalk-report <report_name>

== ``spacewalk-report`` and the reporting database

[command]``spacewalk-report`` uses by default the new reporting database to extract the data.
This means that the new generated reports will have some differences in the structure and the format of the data.
The differences common to all reports are:

- the report data is not changing in real-time, but it's updated only by the execution of a scheduled task;
- data duplication has been removed and columns that were previously considered "multival" contain now multiple values separated by ``;``. This also means that the command line options ``--multival-on-rows`` and ``--multival-separator`` are no longer applicable to the new reports, as their behavior is now the default;
- in all reports the new columns ``mgm_id`` and ``synced_date`` have been introduced to identify the management server in the hub scenario and the last time the information was updated from the application database;
- all boolean values are now represented by the ``True``/``False`` and not by a ``1``/``0`` values;
- the column ``org_id`` has been replaced by ``organization``, which contains the organization name and not the numerical identifier;
- The term "server" has been replaced by "system." So, for example, the column ``server_id`` is now called ``system_id``.

For report specific changes, see <<report-list>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If this changed behavior causes trouble, the new option ``--legacy-report`` can be used to fall back to the old report, which is executed against the application database.
