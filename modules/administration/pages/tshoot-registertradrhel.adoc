Cause: Traditional RHEL 7 and SLES-ES 7 clients require some unsigned packages in order to work properly with {productname}, so custom channels for these client types usually unset the gpgcheck flag.
However, the rhnplugin.conf file overrides this setting, and enables the GPG check.
Consequence: When traditional RHEL 7 or SLES-ES 7 clients are registered, the client will not install unsigned packages from the custom channel, even if the gpgcheck is disabled in the custom channel.
Fix: Edit the /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf file to disable the GPG check.
Result: Unsigned packages can be installed as required, and the clients will work as expected.

Traditional {rhel}{nbsp}7 and SLES {es}{nbsp}7 clients require some unsigned packages to work properly with {productname}, so custom channels for these client types usually unset the ``gpgcheck`` flag.
However, the ``rhnplugin.conf`` file overrides this setting, and enables the GPG check.

This means that when traditional {rhel}{nbsp}7 and SLES {es}{nbsp}7 clients are registered, the client will not install unsigned packages from the custom channel, even if the ``gpgcheck`` is disabled in the custom channel.

To resolve the problem, edit the ``/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/rhnplugin.conf`` file and disable the GPG check to enable installation of unsigned packages, and allow the clients to work as expected.
