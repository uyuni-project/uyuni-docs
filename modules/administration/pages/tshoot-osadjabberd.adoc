In some cases, the maximum number of files that jabber can open is lower than the number of connected OSAD clients.

If this occurs, OSAD clients cannot contact the SUSE Manager Server, and jabberd will take an excessive amount of time to respond on port 5222.

[NOTE]
====
This fix is only required if you have more than 8192 clients connected using OSAD.
In this case, we recommend you consider using Salt clients instead.
For more information about tuning large scale installations, see xref:salt:large-scale.adoc[].
====

You can increase the number of files available to jabber by editing the jabberd local configuration file.
By default, the file is located at [path]``/etc/systemd/system/jabberd.service.d/override.conf``.



.Procedure: Adjusting the Maximum File Count

. At the command prompt, as root, open the local configuration file for editing:
+
----
systemctl edit jabberd
----
. Add or edit this section:
+
----
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=<soft_limit>:<hard_limit>
----
+
The value you choose will vary depending on your environment.
For example, if you have 9500 clients, increase the soft value by 100 to 9600, and the hard value by 1000 to 10500:
+
----
[Unit]
LimitNOFILE=
LimitNOFILE=9600:10500
----
. Save the file and exit the editor.

[NOTE]
====
The default editor for systemctl files is vim.
To save the file and exit, press kbd:[Esc] to enter ``normal`` mode, type kbd:[:wq] and press kbd:[Enter].
====

Ensure you also update the `max_fds` parameter in [path]``/etc/jabberd/c2s.xml``.
For example: `<max_fds>10500</max_fds>`

The soft file limit is the maximum number of open files for a single process.
In {productname} the highest consuming process is ``c2s``, which opens a connection per client.
100 additional files are added, here, to accommodate for any non-connection file that ``c2s`` requires to work correctly.
The hard limit applies to all processes belonging to jabber, and also accounts for open files from the router, ``c2s`` and ``sm`` processes.

== jabberd Database Corruption

``SYMPTOMS``: After _a disk is full error_ or a _disk crash event_, the [systemitem]``jabberd`` database may have become corrupted.
[systemitem]``jabberd`` may then fail starting Spacewalk services:

----
Starting spacewalk services...
   Initializing jabberd processes...
       Starting router                                                                   done
       Starting sm startproc:  exit status of parent of /usr/bin/sm: 2                   failed
   Terminating jabberd processes...
----

[path]``/var/log/messages`` shows more details:

----
jabberd/sm[31445]: starting up
jabberd/sm[31445]: process id is 31445, written to /var/lib/jabberd/pid/sm.pid
jabberd/sm[31445]: loading 'db' storage module
jabberd/sm[31445]: db: corruption detected! close all jabberd processes and run db_recover
jabberd/router[31437]: shutting down
----

``CURE``: Remove the [systemitem]``jabberd`` database and restart.
[systemitem]``jabberd`` will automatically re-create the database.
Enter at the command prompt:

----
spacewalk-service stop
rm -rf /var/lib/jabberd/db/*
spacewalk-service start
----
////

//   ke, 2019-08-08: not sure whether we want this here:

////
An alternative approach would be to test another database, but SUSE Manager does not deliver drivers for this:

----
rcosa-dispatcher stop
rcjabberd stop
cd /var/lib/jabberd/db
rm *
cp /usr/share/doc/packages/jabberd/db-setup.sqlite .
sqlite3 sqlite.db < db-setup.sqlite
chown jabber:jabber *
rcjabberd start
rcosa-dispatcher start

== Capturing XMPP Network Data for Debugging Purposes


If you are experiencing bugs regarding OSAD, it can be useful to dump network messages to help with debugging.
The following procedures provide information on capturing data from both the client and server side.

.Procedure: Server Side Capture
. Install the [package]#tcpdump# package on the server as root:
+

----
zypper in tcpdump
----
. Stop the OSA dispatcher and Jabber processes:
+

----
rcosa-dispatcher stop
rcjabberd stop
----
. Start data capture on port 5222:
+

----
tcpdump -s 0 port 5222 -w server_dump.pcap
----
. Open a second terminal and start the OSA dispatcher and Jabber processes:
+

----
rcosa-dispatcher start
rcjabberd start
----
. Operate the server and clients so the bug you formerly experienced is reproduced.
. When you have finished your capture re-open the first terminal and stop the data capture with kbd:[CTRL+c].

.Procedure: Client Side Capture
. Install the tcpdump package on your client as root:
+

----
zypper in tcpdump
----
. Stop the OSA process:
+

----
rcosad stop
----
. Begin data capture on port 5222:
+

----
tcpdump -s 0 port 5222 -w client_client_dump.pcap
----
. Open a second terminal and start the OSA process:
+

----
rcosad start
----
. Operate the server and clients so the bug you formerly experienced is reproduced.
. When you have finished your capture re-open the first terminal and stop the data capture with kbd:[CTRL+c].
