= Organizations


Organizations are used to manage user access and permissions within {productname}.

For most environments, a single organization is enough.
However, more complicated environments might need several organizations.
You might like to have an organization for each physical location within your business, or for different business functions.

When you have created your organizations, you can create and assign users to your organizations.
You can then assign permissions on an organization level, which applies by default to every user assigned to the organization.

You can also configure authentication methods for your new organization, including PAM and single sign-on.
For more information about authentication, see xref:administration:auth-methods.adoc[].

You must be logged in as the {productname} administrator to create and manage organizations.
