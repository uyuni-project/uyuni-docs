= Users

{productname}Â Administrators can add new users, grant permissions, and deactivate or delete users.
If you are managing a large number of users, you can assign users to system groups to manage permissions at a group level.


[NOTE]
====
The [guimenu]``Users`` menu is only available if you are logged in with a {productname} administrator account.
====


To manage {productname} users, navigate to menu:Users[User List > All] to see all users in your {productname} Server.
Each user in the list shows the username, real name, assigned roles, the date the user last signed in, and the current status of the user.
Click btn:``Create User`` to create a new user account.
Click the username to go to the [guimenu]``User Details`` page.

To add new users to your organization, click btn:[Create User], complete the details for the new user, and click btn:[Create Login].

You can deactivate or delete user accounts if they are no longer required.
Deactivated user accounts can be reactivated at any time.
Deleted user accounts are not visible, and cannot be retrieved.

Users can deactivate their own accounts.
However, if users have an administrator role, the role must be removed before the account can be deactivated.

Deactivated users cannot log in to the {productname} {webui} or schedule any actions.
Actions scheduled by a user prior to their deactivation remain in the action queue.
Deactivated users can be reactivated by {productname} administrators.

Users can hold multiple administrator roles, and there can  be more than one user holding any administrator role at any time.
There must always be at least one active {productname} Administrator.

== User Permissions and Systems

If you have created system groups to manage your clients, you can assign groups to users for them to manage.

To assign a user to a system group, navigate to menu:Users[User List], click the username to edit, and go to the [guimenu]``System Groups`` tab.
Check the groups to assign, and click btn:``Update Defaults``.

You can also select one or more default system groups for a user.
When the user registers a new client, it is assigned to the chosen system group by default.
This allows the user to immediately access the newly-registered client.

For more information about system groups, see xref:reference:systems/system-groups.adoc[].


To see the individual clients a user can administer, navigate to menu:Users[User List], click the username to edit, and go to the [guimenu]``Systems`` tab.
To carry out bulk tasks, you can select clients from the list to add them to the system set manager.

For more information about the system set manager, see xref:client-configuration:using-ssm.adoc[].



== Users and Channel Permissions

You can assign users to software channels within your organization either as a subscriber that consumes content from channels, or as an administrator, who can manage the channels themselves.

To subscribe a user to a channel, navigate to menu:Users[User List], click the username to edit, and go to the menu:Channel Permissions[Subscription] tab.
Check the channels to assign, and click btn:``Update Permissions``.

To grant a user channel management permissions, navigate to menu:Users[User List], click the username to edit, and go to the menu:Channel Permissions[Management] tab.
Check the channels to assign, and click btn:``Update Permissions``.

Some channels in the list might not be subscribable.
This is usually because of the users administrator status, or the channels global settings.
