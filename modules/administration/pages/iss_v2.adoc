= Inter-Server Synchronization - Version 2

If you have more than one {productname} installation, you will need to copy contents between servers.
Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) allows you to export data from one server (source) and import it on another (target) server.
This is useful for hub deployment scenarios or disconnected setups.

[NOTE]
====
With the version 2 ISS implementation {suse} removed the master/slave notion.
Contents can be exported and imported in any direction between any {productname} server.
====


== Install ISS Packages

To use ISS you need to install the [package]``inter-server-sync`` package on source and target servers.



== Content Synchronization


[IMPORTANT]
====
Use [literal]``mgrctl term`` before running steps inside the server container.
====

.Procedure: Export data on source server
. On the source server, on the command line execute the ISS export command.
  The [option]``-h`` option provides detailed help:
+
----
inter-server-sync export -h
----

The export procedure creates an output directory with all the needed data for the import procedure.



.Procedure: Copy export directory to target server
. Contents from the source server needs to be synchronized to the target server.
  On the command line, as root, execute:
+
----
rsync -r <PATH_EXPORTED_DIR> root@<TARGET_SERVER>:~/
----


When all contents is copied, start importing it.



.Procedure: Import data on target server
. On the target server, on the command line execute the ISS import command.
  The [option]``-h`` option provides detailed help:
+
----
inter-server-sync import -h
----



== Database connection configuration


Database connection configuration is loaded by default from ``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``.
Properties file location can be overridden with parameter ``--serverConfig``.



== Known Limitations

* Source and target servers need to be on the same version.
* Export and import organization should have the same name.
