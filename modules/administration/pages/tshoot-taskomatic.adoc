Repository metadata regeneration is a relatively intensive process, so Taskomatic can take several minutes to complete.
Additionally, if Taskomatic crashes, repository metadata regeneration can be interrupted.

If Taskomatic is still running, or if the process has crashed, package updates can seem available in the {webui}, but will not appear on the client, and attempts to update the client will fail.
In this case, the [command]``zypper ref`` command will show an error like this:

----
Valid metadata not found at specified URL
----

To correct this, determine if Taskomatic is still in the process of generating repository metadata, or if a crash could have occurred.
Wait for metadata regeneration to complete or restart Taskomatic after a crash in order for client updates to be carried out correctly.



.Procedure: Resolving Taskomatic Problems

. On the {productname} Server, check the [path]``/var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`` file to determine if any metadata regeneration processes are still running, or if a crash occurred.
. Restart taskomatic:
+
----
service taskomatic restart
----


In the Taskomatic log files, you can identify the section related to metadata regeneration by looking for opening and closing lines that look like this:

----
