[[crash-reporting]]
= Crash Reporting

Crash reporting is used to automatically monitor and report on traditional {redhat} clients that have experienced a crash.

Clients that have crash reporting enabled report any crashes to the {productname} Server.
This allows you to see what crashes have occurred, manage crash reports, and add custom notes to crashes from within the {productname} {webui}.
You can also run reports on crashes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Crash reporting works only with traditional {redhat} clients.
It does not work with Salt clients, or with traditional clients running any other operating system.
====

Crash reporting requires the ``spacewalk-abrt`` package installed on the client you want to monitor.
To manage crash reports in the {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Software Crashes].



== Crash Notes

You can create custom notes for each crash report using the {productname} {webui}.
Navigate to menu:Systems[Systems List] and select the client that crashed.
Navigate to the menu:Software[Software Crashes] tab to see a list of all current crashes for the selected client.
Click the crash to see more information, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Crash Notes`` tab to add or edit notes.



== Organization Crash Configuration

You can manage crash reporting for your entire organization, turning the feature on or off, changing whether crash files are uploaded, and setting a size limit for file upload sizes.
Navigate to menu:Admin[Organizations] and select the organization you want to manage.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``Configuration`` tab and change the settings as required.
Click btn:[Update Organization] to save the changes.

== Managing Crash Reports with the API

Use these API calls to manage reported software crashes:

----
system.crash.getLastReportDate()
system.crash.getUniqueCrashCount()
system.crash.getTotalCrashCount()
system.crash.listSystemCrashes()
system.crash.listSystemCrashFiles()
system.crash.deleteCrash()
system.crash.getCrashFileUrl()
system.crash.getCrashFile()
----


Use these API calls to manage notes on crashes:

----
system.crash.createCrashNote()
system.crash.deleteCrashNote()
system.crash.getCrashNotesForCrash()
----


Use these API calls to manage organization settings for crash reporting:

----
org.getCrashFileSizeLimit()
org.setCrashFileSizeLimit()
org.isCrashReportingEnabled()
org.setCrashReporting()
org.isCrashfileUploadEnabled()
org.setCrashfileUpload()
