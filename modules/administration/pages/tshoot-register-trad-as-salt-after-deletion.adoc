This is not a valid scenario. Normally you migrate a traditional client to a Salt minion without deleting the client.
Salt automatically detects that you have a traditional client and does the necessary changes itself. But if you somehow
deleted the traditional client and want to register it as a Salt minion again, you have to do the following steps on the
client before registering it as Salt minion:

. Remove the following file:
+
----
/etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid
----
+
. Remove the following package:
+

zypp-plugin-spacewalk
