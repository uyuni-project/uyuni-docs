==== Image Inspection


A base container image (BCI) comes with all the software to run it, but because BCIs are lightweight they may not come with all tools and libraries you may need for inspection.

When inspecting a container image you can see an error message such as:

----
libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
----

A BCI can be used in the other scenarios than with the container build host and using the {salt} bundle for the inspection, but if you need inspection to work you must add all needed software in advance.

To avoid such issues you must add [systemitem]``libopenssl`` to the image with [systemitem]``Dockerfile`` and rebuild the image.

The same can happen with [systemitem]``libexpat``.
