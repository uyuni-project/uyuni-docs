= Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

You can monitor your {productname} environment using Prometheus and Grafana.
{productname} Server and Proxy are able to provide self-health metrics.
You can also install and manage a number of Prometheus exporters on Salt clients.

Prometheus and Grafana packages are included in the {productname} Client Tools for:

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

* {sle}{nbsp}12
* {sle}{nbsp}15
* openSUSE Leap 15.x

endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]

* {sle}{nbsp}12
* {sle}{nbsp}15
* openSUSE Leap 15.x

endif::[]

You need to install Prometheus and Grafana on a machine separate from the {productname} Server.
We recommend to use a managed Salt client as your monitoring server.

Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to monitored clients.
Clients must have corresponding open ports and be reachable over the network.
Alternatively, you can use reverse proxies to establish a connection.


ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
[NOTE]
====
You must have a monitoring add-on subscription for each client you want to monitor.
Visit the {scc} to manage your {productname} subscriptions.

== Prometheus and Grafana


=== Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool that is used to record real-time metrics in a time-series database.
Metrics are pulled via HTTP, enabling high performance and scalability.

Prometheus metrics are time series data, or timestamped values belonging to the same group or dimension.
A metric is uniquely identified by its name and set of labels.

// TODO:: This should be an actual image.

----
   metric name               labels                 timestamp     value
┌────────┴───────┐  ┌───────────┴───────────┐    ┌──────┴──────┐  ┌─┴─┐
http_requests_total{status="200", method="GET"}  @1557331801.111  42236
----

Each application or system being monitored must expose metrics in the format above, either through code instrumentation or Prometheus exporters.


=== Prometheus Exporters

Exporters are libraries that help with exporting metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics.
Exporters are useful whenever it is not feasible to instrument a given application or system with Prometheus metrics directly.
Multiple exporters can run on a monitored host to export local metrics.

The Prometheus community provides a list of official exporters, and more can be found as community contributions.
For more information and an extensive list of exporters, see https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/.


=== Grafana

Grafana is a tool for data visualization, monitoring, and analysis.
It is used to create dashboards with panels representing specific metrics over a set period of time.
Grafana is commonly used together with Prometheus, but also supports other data sources such as ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Influx DB.
For more information about Grafana, see https://grafana.com/docs/.



== Set up the Monitoring Server

To set up your monitoring server, you need to install Prometheus and Grafana, and configure them.



=== Install Prometheus

If your monitoring server is a Salt client, you can install the Prometheus package using the {productname} {webui}.
Otherwise you can download and install the package on your monitoring server manually.
The Prometheus software is also available for {productname} Proxy and {productname} {smr} Branch Server.

[NOTE]
====
Prometheus expects POSIX filesystem for storing data.
Non-POSIX compliant filesystems are not supported.
NFS filesystems are explicitly not supported.

== Configure {productname} Monitoring

With {productname}{nbsp}4 and higher, you can enable the server to expose Prometheus self-health metrics, and also install and configure exporters on client systems.



=== Server Self Monitoring

The Server self-health metrics cover hardware, operating system and {productname} internals.
These metrics are made available by instrumentation of the Java application, combined with Prometheus exporters.

These exporter packages are shipped with {productname} Server:

* Node exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter.
* PostgreSQL exporter: [systemitem]``prometheus-postgres_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter.
* JMX exporter: [systemitem]``prometheus-jmx_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter.
* Apache exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-lusitaniae-apache_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter.

These exporter packages are shipped with {productname} Proxy:

* Node exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter.
* Squid exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-boynux-squid_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/boynux/squid-exporter.

The exporter packages are pre-installed in {productname} Server and Proxy, but their respective systemd daemons are disabled by default.



.Procedure: Enabling Self Monitoring

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Manager Configuration > Monitoring].
. Click btn:[Enable services].
. Restart Tomcat and Taskomatic.
. Navigate to the URL of your Prometheus server, on port 9090 (for example, [literal]``http://example.com:9090``)
. In the Prometheus UI, navigate to menu:[Status > Targets] and confirm that all the endpoints on the ``mgr-server`` group are up.
. If you have also installed Grafana with the {webui}, the server insights are visible on the {productname} Server dashboard.

image::monitoring_enable_services.png[scaledwidth=80%]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only server self-health monitoring can be enabled using the {webui}.
Metrics for a proxy are not automatically collected by Prometheus.
To enable self-health monitoring on a proxy, you need to manually install exporters and enable them.
====



=== Monitoring Managed Systems

Prometheus metrics exporters can be installed and configured on Salt clients using formulas.
The packages are available from the {productname} client tools channels, and can be enabled and configured directly in the {productname} {webui}.

These exporters can be installed on managed systems:

* Node exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter.
* PostgreSQL exporter: [systemitem]``prometheus-postgres_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter.
* Apache exporter: [systemitem]``golang-github-lusitaniae-apache_exporter``.
    See https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter.

When you have the exporters installed and configured, you can start using Prometheus to collect metrics from monitored systems.
If you have configured your monitoring server with the {webui}, metrics collection happens automatically.



.Procedure: Configuring Prometheus Exporters on a Client

. In the {productname} {webui}, open the details page of the client to be monitored, and navigate to the menu:Formulas tab.
. Check the [guimenu]``Enabled`` checkbox on the ``Prometheus Exporters`` formula.
. Click btn:[Save].
. Navigate to the menu:Formulas[Prometheus Exporters] tab.
. Select the exporters you want to enable and customize arguments according to your needs.
    The [guimenu]``Address`` field accepts either a port number preceded by a colon (``:9100``), or a fully resolvable address (``example:9100``).
. Click btn:[Save Formula].
. Apply the highstate.

image::monitoring_configure_formula.png[scaledwidth=80%]

[NOTE]
====
Monitoring formulas can also be configured for System Groups, by applying the same configuration used for individual systems inside the corresponding group.
====

// The WebUI says that we describe the available arguments in the exporters formula, but I don't see it. Might be best to put it in the Salt Guide, then xref from here. --LKB 2020-08-11

For more information about the monitoring formulas, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-monitoring.adoc[].



== Network Boundaries

Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to monitored clients.
By default, Prometheus uses these ports:

* Node exporter: 9100
* PostgreSQL exporter: 9187
* Apache exporter: 9117

Additionally, if you are running the alert manager on a different host than where you run Prometheus, you also need to open port 9093.

For clients installed on cloud instances, you can add the required ports to a security group that has access to the monitoring server.

Alternatively, you can deploy a Prometheus instance in the exporters' local network, and configure federation.
This allows the main monitoring server to scrape the time series from the local Prometheus instance.
If you use this method, you only need to open the Prometheus API port, which is 9090.

For more information on Prometheus federation, see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/.

You can also proxy requests through the network boundary.
Tools like PushProx deploy a proxy and a client on both sides of the network barrier and allow Prometheus to work across network topologies such as NAT.

For more information on PushProx, see https://github.com/RobustPerception/PushProx.



=== Reverse Proxy Setup

Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to each exporter on the monitored clients.
To simplify your firewall configuration, you can use reverse proxy for your exporters to expose all metrics on a single port.

// Probably a diagram here. --LKB 2020-08-11



.Procedure: Installing Prometheus Exporters with Reverse Proxy
. In the {productname} {webui}, open the details page of the system to be monitored, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. Check the [guimenu]``Prometheus Exporters`` checkbox to enable the exporters formula, and click btn:[Save].
. Navigate to the ``Prometheus Exporters`` tab in the top menu.
. Check the [guimenu]``Enable reverse proxy`` option, and enter a valid reverse proxy port number.
    For example, ``9999``.
. Customize the other exporters according to your needs.
. Click btn:[Save Formula].
. Apply the highstate and confirm that it completes successfully.

For more information about the monitoring formulas, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-monitoring.adoc[].



== Security

Prometheus server and Prometheus node exporter offer a built-in mechanism to secure their endpoints with TLS encryption and authentication.
{productname} {webui} simplifies the configuration of all involved components. The TLS certificates have to be provided and deployed by the user.
{productname} offers enabling the following security model:

* Node exporter: TLS encryption and client certificate based authentication
* Prometheus: TLS encryption and basic authentication

For more information about configuring all available options, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-monitoring.adoc[].

=== Generating TLS certificates

By default, {productname} does not provide any certificates for securing monitoring configuration.
For providing security, you can generate or import custom certificates, self-signed or signed by a third party certificate authority (CA).

This section demonstrates how to generate client/server certificates for Prometheus and Node exporter minions self-signed with SUSE Manager CA.

.Procedure: Creating server/client TLS certificate

. On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, run following command:
+
----
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir="/root/ssl-build" --set-country="COUNTRY" \
--set-state="STATE" --set-city="CITY" --set-org="ORGANIZATION" \
--set-org-unit="ORGANIZATION UNIT" --set-email="name@example.com" \
--set-hostname="minion.example.com" --set-cname="minion.example.com" --no-rpm
----
Ensure that the [systemitem]``set-cname`` parameter is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Salt client.
You can use the the [systemitem]``set-cname`` parameter multiple times if you require multiple aliases.

. Copy ``server.crt`` and ``server.key`` files to the Salt minion and provide read access for ``prometheus`` user.
