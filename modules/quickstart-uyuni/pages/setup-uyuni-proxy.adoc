[[uyuni-proxy-setup]]
= Uyuni Proxy Setup

{productname} Proxy requires additional configuration.



[[uyuni-proxy-setup-pattern]]
== Install the [path]``uyuni_proxy`` pattern

Check that the Proxy pattern is installed correctly.
This step is part of xref:installation:install-proxy-uyuni.adoc[].
To verify a successful installation, on the server select the [package]``pattern_uyuni_proxy`` package for installation.

The salt-broker service will be automatically started after installation is complete.
This service forwards the Salt interactions to the {productname} server.

// REMARK 2019-08-23, ke: Is this a Salt proxy-only feature?
[NOTE]
.Proxy Chains
====
It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain.
In such a case, the upstream proxy is named `parent`.
====

Make sure the TCP ports `4505` and `4506` are open on the proxy.
The proxy must be able to reach the {productname} Server or a parent proxy on these ports.



[[uyuni-proxy-setup-copycert]]
== Copy Server Certificate and Key

The proxy will share some SSL information with the {productname} Server.
Copy the certificate and its key from the {productname} Server or the parent proxy.

As root, enter the following commands on the proxy using your {productname} Server or parent Proxy (named [replaceable]``PARENT``):

----
mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build
cd /root/ssl-build
scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY .
scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT .
scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf .
----


[NOTE]
====
To keep the security chain intact, the {productname} Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the {productname} Server certificate.
Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported.
====



[[uyuni-proxy-setup-confproxy]]
== Run [command]``configure-proxy.sh``

The [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` script finalizes the setup of your {productname} Proxy.

Execute the interactive [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` script.
Pressing kbd:[Enter] without further input will make the script use the default values provided between brackets ``[]``.
Here is some information about the requested settings:

{productname} Parent::
A {productname} parent can be either another proxy or a {productname} Server.

HTTP Proxy::
A HTTP proxy enables your {productname} proxy to access the Web.
This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall.

Traceback Email::
An email address where to report problems.

Use SSL::
For safety reasons, press ``Y``.

Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates?::
Answer ``N``.
This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the {productname} server.

Organization::
The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy.
The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server.

Organization Unit::
The default value here is the proxy's hostname.

City::
Further information attached to the proxy's certificate.

State::
Further information attached to the proxy's certificate.

Country Code::
In the [guimenu]``country code`` field, enter the country code set during the {productname} installation.
For example, if your proxy is in the US and your {productname} is in DE, enter `DE` for the proxy.
+

[NOTE]
====
The country code must be two upper case letters.
For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search.
====

Cname Aliases (Separated by Space)::
Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases.
Otherwise it can be left empty.

CA Password::
Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your {productname} Server.

Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion?::
Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server.

Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001?::
Accept default ``Y``.

SUSE Manager Username::
Use same user name and password as on the {productname} server.

If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files.
When the mandatory files are copied, run [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` again.
If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again.

[command]``configure-proxy.sh`` activates services required by {productname} Proxy, such as [systemitem]``squid``, [systemitem]``apache2``, [systemitem]``salt-broker``, and [systemitem]``jabberd``.

To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system's details page on the {webui} (menu:Systems[Proxy], then the system name).
[guimenu]``Connection`` and [guimenu]``Proxy`` subtabs display various status information.



[[uyuni-proxy-setup-pxe]]
== Enable PXE Boot



[[proxy.pxe.sync]]
=== Synchronize Profiles and System Information

To enable PXE boot through a proxy, additional software must be installed and configured on both the {productname} Proxy and the  {productname} Server.

. On the {productname} Proxy, install the [package]``susemanager-tftpsync-recv`` package:
+

----
zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv
----

. On the {productname} Proxy, run the [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh`` setup script and enter the requested information:
+

----
configure-tftpsync.sh
----
+

You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the {productname} Server and the proxy.
You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy.

. On the {productname} Server, install [package]``susemanager-tftpsync``:
+

----
zypper in susemanager-tftpsync
----

// same file name on the server and proxy!
. On the {productname} Server, run [command]``configure-tftpsync.sh``.
    This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the {productname} Proxy:
+

----
configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy
----

. Start an initial synchronization on the {productname} Server:
+

----
cobbler sync
----
+

It can also be done after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately.
Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed.
For more information about Cobbler, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[Cobbler].



[[proxy.pxe.dhcp]]
=== Configure DHCP for PXE through Proxy

{productname} uses Cobbler for client provisioning.
PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default.
Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the {productname} Proxy using DHCP.
Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned:

----
next-server: <IP_Address_of_Proxy>
filename: "pxelinux.0"
----



[[replace-uyuniproxy]]
== Replace a {productname} Proxy

A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it.
Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time.
The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor.

Shut down the old proxy, and leave it installed while you prepare the replacement.
Create a reactivation key for this system and then register the new proxy using the reactivation key.
If you do not use the reactivation key, you will need to re-register all the clients against the new proxy.

[NOTE]
====
The reactivation key is only needed if you do not want to lose the history of the machine.
If you do not use a reactivation key, the replacement proxy will become a "new" one with a new ID.
====


[[proxy.migration3.replace]]
.Procedure: Replacing a Proxy and Keeping the Clients Registered
. Before starting the actual migration procedure, save the data from the old proxy, if needed.
    Consider copying important or manually created data to a central place that can also be accessed by the new proxy.
. Shut down the proxy.
. Install a new {productname} Proxy.
    For installation instructions, see xref:install-proxy-unified.adoc[Proxy Installation].
. In the {productname} {webui}, select the newly installed {productname} Proxy, and delete it from the systems list.
. In the {webui}, create a reactivation key for the old proxy system: On the System Details tab of the old proxy click [guimenu]``Reactivation``.
    Click [guimenu]``Generate New Key``, and make a note of the new key, as you will need it later.
    For more information about reactivation keys, see xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-reactivation.adoc[Reactivation Keys].
. OPTIONAL: After the installation of the new proxy, you might also need to:
+
* Copy the centrally saved data to the new proxy system
* Install any other needed software
* Set up TFTP synchronization if the proxy is used for autoinstallation

[IMPORTANT]
====
During the installation of the proxy, clients will not be able to reach the {productname} Server.
After you have deleted a proxy, the systems list can be temporarily incorrect.
All clients that were previously connected to the proxy will show as being directly connected to the server instead.
After the first successful operation on a client, such as execution of a remote command or installation of a package or patch, this information will automatically be corrected.
This may take some hours.
