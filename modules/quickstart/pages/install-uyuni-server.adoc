== Install Uyuni Server on openSUSE Leap

You can use a physical or virtual machine running openSUSE Leap to install the Uyuni Server.
Configure a resolvable fully qualified domain name on the server before you begin, to ensure that the server is accessible across the network.

The {productname} Server software is available from download.opensuse.org, and you can use zypper to retrieve the software and install it.



.Procedure: Installing openSUSE Leap with Uyuni

. Install openSUSE Leap as the base system, and ensure all available service packs and package updates have been applied.
. Configure a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) with {yast} by navigating to menu:System[Network Settings > Hostname/DNS].
. At the command prompt, as root, add the repository for installing the {productname} Server software:
+
----
repo=repositories/systemsmanagement:/
repo=${repo}Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-x86_64-Media1/
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/$repo uyuni-server-stable
----
. Refresh metadata from the repositories:
+
----
zypper ref
----
. Install the pattern for the {productname} Server:
+
----
zypper in patterns-uyuni_server
----
. Reboot the server.

When the installation is complete, you can continue with {productname} setup.
For more information, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:uyuni-server-setup.adoc[].



== Set up Uyuni Server with {yast}

The initial setup procedure is handled by {yast}.



.Procedure: {productname} Setup
. Log in to the {productname} Server and start {yast}.
. In {yast}, navigate to menu:Network Services[Uyuni Setup] to begin the setup.
. From the introduction screen select menu:Uyuni Setup[Set up Uyuni from scratch] and click btn:[Next] to continue.
. Enter an email address to receive status notifications and click btn:[Next] to continue.
  {productname} can sometimes send a large volume of notification emails.
  You can disable email notifications in the {webui} after setup, if you need to.

== Create the Main Administration Account

Before you can log in to the server to manage your clients, you need to have created an administration account.
The main administration account has the highest authority within {productname}.
Ensure you keep access information for this account secure.
We recommend that you create lower level administration accounts for organizations and groups.
Do not share the main administration access details.



.Procedure: Setting Up the Main Administration Account
. In your web browser, enter the address for the {productname} {webui}.
  This address was provided after you completed setup.
. Sign in to the {webui}, navigate to the menu:Create Organization[Organization Name] field, and enter your organization name.
. In the menu:Create Organization[Desired Login] and menu:Create Organization[Desired Password] fields, enter your username and password.
. Fill in the account information fields, including an email for system notifications.
. Click btn:[Create Organization] to finish creating your administration account.

When you have completed the {productname} {webui} setup, you are taken to the menu:Home[Overview] page.



== Optional: Synchronizing Products from {scc}

{scc} (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture.
After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels.

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[NOTE]
====
For Uyuni, synchronizing products from {scc} is optional.
====

Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in {productname}.
The organization credentials give you access to the {suse} product downloads.
You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations.

Enter your organization credentials in the {productname} {webui}:



.Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. In the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page, navigate to the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. Enter a username and password, and click btn:[Save].

A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed.
When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with {scc}.



.Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
  Wait a moment for the products list to populate.
  If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
  This table lists architecture, channels, and status information.
. If your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.
. Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
  Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
. Click btn:[Add Products] to start product synchronization.

When a channel is added, {productname} will schedule the channel for synchronization.
Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time.
You can monitor synchronization progress in the {webui}.

For more information about using the setup wizard, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients.
For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
