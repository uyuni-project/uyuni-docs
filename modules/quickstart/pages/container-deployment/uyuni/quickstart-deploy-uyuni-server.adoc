= Deploy {productname} {productnumber} Server

In this quickstart, you will embark on deploying {productname} {productnumber} Server. 
There are several methods to accomplish this task. 

You may opt to deploy it in the **cloud**, or deploy it on a local host running **{leapmicro}** or **{leap} {opensuse-version}**. 
However, for the purpose of this quickstart guide, we've chosen to focus on setting up a **KVM environment**, installed on **{leap}** with Gnome Desktop, as the initial step. Installation on **{leapmicro}** is done via the command line and is outside the scope of this quickstart. 

== Software and Hardware Requirements for {productname}

This table shows the software and hardware requirements for deploying {productname} Server on KVM.
For the purposes of this guide expect to deploy on a virtual machine with 16GB of RAM, and at least 200 GB of disk space.

|===

== Prepare the Physical Machine

Install {leap} on a bare metal physical machine, or continue using your existing installation.
See: link:https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/startup/html/book-startup/art-opensuse-installquick.html#sec-opensuse-installquick-install[Installating {leap}]

[NOTE]
====
For this guide you can also use {tumbleweed} as the KVM host. However, keep in mind that {leap} {opensuse-version} is officially supported.
====

Update the system:

----
sudo zypper ref && zypper up
----



== Install KVM Tools


. Install KVM server and kvm tools:
+
----
sudo zypper in -t pattern kvm_server kvm_tools
----
+

. Reboot.



== Setup KVM Network

[NOTE]
====
This XML configuration builds a KVM subnet using the domain name of container.lab to setup a FQDN for your test server.

In a production environment your company's administration services should provide you with a FQDN.
====

.Procedure: Setup the KVM Network
. Open the [systemitem]``Virt Machine Manager`` GUI. In Gnome you can click the windows button on your keyboard and type in [systemitem]``virt-manager``. Alternatively you can open a command prompt and type: `virt-manager` and click the btn:[Enter].

. Select menu:edit[Preferences].

. In [literal]``Preferences`` under the [literal]``General`` tab select the checkbox [systemitem]``Enable XML editing``. Click the close button when complete.

.  Double click **QEMU/KVM** text in the main window or select menu:Edit[Connection Details] to open the [systemitem]``Connection Details`` window.

. Select the [systemitem]``Virtual Networks`` tab then the [systemitem]``XML`` tab.

. If the default network is running, stop it using the [systemitem]``X`` button in the lower left.

. Copy and paste the following XML snippet **beneath** your [systemitem]``<uuid>`` block:
+

[source, xml]
----
<forward mode="nat">
    <nat>
      <port start="1024" end="65535"/>
    </nat>
  </forward>

+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot the system.

. Login as root.

. Enter the transactional shell:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update shell
----


. Add the continer utility repository:
+

[source, shell]
----
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Leap_Micro_5.5/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Stable:ContainerUtils.repo
----

. Refresh the repository list and accept the key:
+

----
zypper ref
----
+

. Install the container tools:
+

[source, shell]
----
zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion netavark
----
+

. Reboot the host.

== Deploy {productname} with mgradm

{productname} is deployed as a container using the [command]``mgradm`` tool.
There are two methods of deploying a {productname} server as a container. 
In this section we will focus on basic container deployment.

For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy see, xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/mgradm-yaml-custom-configuration.adoc[Configuration and deployment with mgradm and a custom yaml file].


For additional information, you can explore further by running [command]``mgradm --help`` from the command line.


.Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman
. From the terminal run the following command as root.
+

[source, shell]
....
mgradm install podman
....
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must deploy the container as root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step. {leapmicro} by default uses the root account.

[source, shell]
----
INF Setting up uyuni network
9:58AM INF Enabling system service
9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error="open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied"
----
====
+

. Input a password for the CA certificate, an administrative account password and your email for notifications:
+

----
leapmicro:~ # mgradm install podman
3:07PM INF Welcome to mgradm
3:07PM INF Executing command: podman
Password for the CA certificate to generate: 
Administrator password: 
Administrator's email: admin@example.com
----
+

. The container will take some minutes to deploy. 

. Once complete open a browser and visit link:https://leapmicro.uyuni.lab[] to begin working with {productname}.



== Optional: Synchronizing Products from {scc}

{scc} (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture.
After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels.

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[NOTE]
====
For Uyuni, synchronizing products from {scc} is optional.
====

Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in {productname}.
The organization credentials give you access to the {suse} product downloads.
You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations.

Enter your organization credentials in the {productname} {webui}:



.Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].

. In the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page, navigate to the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.

. Click btn:[Add a new credential].

. Enter a username and password, and click btn:[Save].

A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed.
When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with {scc}.



.Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].

. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
  Wait a moment for the products list to populate.
  If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
  This table lists architecture, channels, and status information.

. If your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.

. Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
  Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.

. Click btn:[Add Products] to start product synchronization.

When a channel is added, {productname} will schedule the channel for synchronization.
Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time.
You can monitor synchronization progress in the {webui}.

For more information about using the setup wizard, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients.
For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
