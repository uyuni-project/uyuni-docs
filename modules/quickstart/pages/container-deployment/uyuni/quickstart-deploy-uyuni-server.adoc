= Deploy {productname} {productnumber} Server as a container

In this quickstart, you will embark on deploying {productname} {productnumber} Server. 
There are several methods to accomplish this task. 

You may opt to deploy it in the cloud, or deploy it on a local host running {leapmicro} or {leap} {opensuse-version}. 
However, for the purpose of this quickstart guide, we've chosen to focus on setting up a KVM environment, installed on {opensuse} {leap} with Gnome Desktop, as the initial step. Installation on {leapmicro} is done via the command line and is outside the scope of this quickstart. 

This guide will lead you through the following steps:

. Installing {opensuse} {leap} on a physical machine for KVM installation.
. Setting up KVM tools and using it to configure a **container.lab** network.
. Aquire the leap micro image
. Move it to the correct location
. Create and startup a new KVM machine using {leapmicro} for use as the **container host**.
. Update the {leapmicro} virtual machine
. Install **Podman**, and **container utilities** on the **container host**.
. Deploy the {productname} container
. Login to the webui


== Prepare the physical machine

Install {opensuse} {leap} on a bare metal physical machine, or continue using your existing installation.
See: link:https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/startup/html/book-startup/art-opensuse-installquick.html#sec-opensuse-installquick-install[Installating {opensuse} {leap}]

[NOTE]
====
For this guide you can also use {tumbleweed} as the KVM host. However, keep in mind that {leap} {opensuse-version} is officially supported.
====

Update the system:
----
sudo zypper ref && zypper up
----

== Install KVM tools


. Install KVM server and kvm tools:
+
----
sudo zypper in -t pattern kvm_server kvm_tools
----
+

. Reboot.



== Setup KVM network

[NOTE]
====
This XML configuration builds a KVM subnet using the domain name of container.lab to setup a FQDN for your test server.

In a production environment your company's administration services should provide you with a FQDN.
====

.Procedure: Setup the KVM Network
. Open the [systemitem]``Virt Machine Manager`` GUI. In Gnome you can click the windows button on your keyboard and type in [systemitem]``virt-manager``. Alternatively you can open a command prompt and type: `virt-manager` and click the btn:Enter[].

. Select menu:edit[Preferences].

. In [literal]``Preferences`` under the [literal]``General`` tab select the checkbox [systemitem]``Enable XML editing``. Click the close button when complete.

.  Double click **QEMU/KVM** text in the main window or select menu:Edit[Connection Details] to open the [systemitem]``Connection Details`` window.

. Select the [systemitem]``Virtual Networks`` tab then the [systemitem]``XML`` tab.

. If the default network is running, stop it using the [systemitem]``X`` button in the lower left.

. Copy and paste the following XML snippet **beneath** your [systemitem]``<uuid>`` block:
+

[source, xml]
----
<forward mode="nat">
    <nat>
      <port start="1024" end="65535"/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name="virbr0" stp="on" delay="0"/>
  <mac address="52:54:00:9f:d0:0b"/>
  <domain name="container.lab" localOnly="yes"/>
  <ip address="192.168.122.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
    <dhcp>
      <range start="192.168.122.2" end="192.168.122.254"/>
      <host mac="52:54:00:0A:CC:B8" name="leapmicro" ip="192.168.122.10"/>
      <host mac="52:54:00:EE:88:85" name="minion-one" ip="192.168.122.11"/>
      <host mac="52:54:00:F2:B0:DF" name="minion-two" ip="192.168.122.12"/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>

== Optional: Synchronizing Products from {scc}

{scc} (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture.
After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels.

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[NOTE]
====
For Uyuni, synchronizing products from {scc} is optional.
====

Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in {productname}.
The organization credentials give you access to the {suse} product downloads.
You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations.

Enter your organization credentials in the {productname} {webui}:



.Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. In the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page, navigate to the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. Enter a username and password, and click btn:[Save].

A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed.
When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with {scc}.



.Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
  Wait a moment for the products list to populate.
  If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
  This table lists architecture, channels, and status information.
. If your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.
. Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
  Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
. Click btn:[Add Products] to start product synchronization.

When a channel is added, {productname} will schedule the channel for synchronization.
Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time.
You can monitor synchronization progress in the {webui}.

For more information about using the setup wizard, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients.
For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
