.Official operating system for the Server Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {leapmicro} {microversion}.

Container host:: A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully. An FQDN typically follows the format <host>.<domain>.com.

For instance:

* uyuni.example.com
* uyuni.fritz.box
* uyuni.container.lab

For additional details, refer to the section on network requirements in the Installation and Upgrade Guide, available at xref:installation-and-upgrade:network-requirements.adoc[].

== Aquire the {leapmicro} {microversion} Image

. Proceed to: link:https://get.opensuse.org/leapmicro/5.5/#download[Download {leapmicro} {microversion}]
. Select and download the **Offline Image**.
. Prepare a USB fash disk or DVD for installation.
. Insert a DVD or a bootable USB stick containing the installation image for openSUSE Leap.
. Boot or reboot your system.



== Container Host Installation

For detailed documentation on preparing your machines OS (virtual or physical), see link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.5/html/SLE-Micro-all/book-deployment-slemicro.html[{micro} {microversion} Deployment Guide].

.Procedure: {leapmicro} {microversion} Installation 
. Use the arrow keys to select [systemitem]``Installation``.

. On the [systemitem]``Language, Keyboard and license Agreement`` page click btn:[Next].

. On the [systemitem]``NTP Configuration`` page click btn:[Next].

. On the [systemitem]``Authentication for the System`` page enter a password for the root user. Click btn:[Next].

. On the [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` page click btn:[Install].



== Update the system and Install Container Tools
. Login at the prompt as *root*.

. Run **transactional-update**:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot the system.

. Login as root.

. Enter the transactional shell:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update shell
----

. Add the continer utility repository:
+

[source, shell]
----
zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Leap_Micro_5.5/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Stable:ContainerUtils.repo
----

. Refresh the repository list and accept the key:
+

----
zypper ref
----
+

. Install the container tools:
+

[source, shell]
----
zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion 
----
+

. Reboot the host.

== Deploy {productname} with mgradm

{productname} is deployed as a container using the [command]``mgradm`` tool.
There are two methods of deploying a {productname} server as a container. 
In this section we will focus on basic container deployment.

For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy see, xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-management/mgradm-yaml-custom-configuration.adoc[Configuration and deployment with mgradm and a custom yaml file].


For additional information, you can explore further by running [command]``mgradm --help`` from the command line.


.Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman
. From the terminal run the following command as root.
+

[source, shell]
....
mgradm install podman
....
+

. Input a password for the CA certificate, an administrative account password and your email for notifications:
+

----
leapmicro:~ # mgradm install podman
3:07PM INF Welcome to mgradm
3:07PM INF Executing command: podman
Password for the CA certificate to generate: 
Administrator password: 
Administrator's email: admin@example.com
----
+

. The container will take some minutes to deploy. 

. Once complete open a browser and visit link:https://leapmicro.uyuni.lab[] to begin working with {productname}.



== Optional: Synchronizing Products from {scc}

{scc} (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems.
These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture.
After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels.

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[NOTE]
====
For Uyuni, synchronizing products from {scc} is optional.
====

Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in {productname}.
The organization credentials give you access to the {suse} product downloads.
You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations.

Enter your organization credentials in the {productname} {webui}:



.Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].

. In the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page, navigate to the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.

. Click btn:[Add a new credential].

. Enter a username and password, and click btn:[Save].

A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed.
When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with {scc}.



.Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].

. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
  Wait a moment for the products list to populate.
  If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
  This table lists architecture, channels, and status information.

. If your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.

. Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
  Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.

. Click btn:[Add Products] to start product synchronization.

When a channel is added, {productname} will schedule the channel for synchronization.
Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time.
You can monitor synchronization progress in the {webui}.

For more information about using the setup wizard, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients.
For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
