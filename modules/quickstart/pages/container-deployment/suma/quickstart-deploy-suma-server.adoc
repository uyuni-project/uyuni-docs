= Deploy {productname} {productnumber} Server
//ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
//:noindex:
//endif::[]

This quick start guide shows you how to install and configure a {productname} {productnumber} container for x86-64 architecture on {micro} {microversion}.

For this topic we assume that you already have valid organization credentials with {scc} and have obtained a registration code for both the host system and the containerized server, for example from a "SUSE Manager Lifecycle Management+" subscription.

In this quickstart, you will embark on deploying {productname} {productnumber} Server. 
There are several methods to accomplish this task. 
You may opt to deploy it in the cloud, or deploy it on {micro}. 
However, for the purpose of this quickstart guide, we've chosen to focus on setting up a simple KVM environment, installed on {leap}, as the lab host.

This guide will lead you through the following steps:

. Installing {opensuse} {leap} on a physical machine.
. Installating KVM tools and using it to configure a **suse.lab** network.
. Create a new KVM host machine using {micro} as the **container host**.




== Software and Hardware Requirements for {productname}

This table shows the software and hardware requirements for deploying {productname} Server on KVM.
For the purposes of this guide expect to deploy on a virtual machine with 16GB of RAM, and at least 200 GB of disk space.

.Supported operating system for the Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported host operating system for the container host is {micro} {microversion}.
====

.Base operating system for the Container Image
[NOTE]
====
{productname} {productnumber} uses {sle} {bci-suma} as the base operating system of the container image or **BCI**.
====



== Prepare the Physical Machine

=== Install {leap} {opensuse-version}

Install {leap} {opensuse-version} on a bare metal physical machine, or continue using your existing installation.
See: link:https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/startup/html/book-startup/art-opensuse-installquick.html#sec-opensuse-installquick-install[Installating {leap}]



=== Update the system

Update the system:

----
sudo zypper ref && zypper up
----



=== Install KVM Tools


. Install KVM server and kvm tools:
+
----
sudo zypper in -t pattern kvm_server kvm_tools
----
+

. Reboot.



=== Setup the KVM Network

[NOTE]
====
This XML configuration builds a KVM subnet using the domain name of **suse.lab** to setup the required FQDN for your test server.

In a production environment your company's administration services should provide you with a FQDN.
====



.Procedure: Setup the KVM Network
. Open the [systemitem]``Virt Machine Manager`` GUI. In Gnome you can click the windows button on your keyboard and type in [systemitem]``virt-manager``. Alternatively you can open a command prompt and type: `virt-manager` and click the btn:[Enter].

. Select menu:edit[Preferences].

. In [literal]``Preferences`` under the [literal]``General`` tab select the checkbox [systemitem]``Enable XML editing``. Click the close button when complete.

.  Double click **QEMU/KVM** text in the main window or select menu:Edit[Connection Details] to open the [systemitem]``Connection Details`` window.

. Select the [systemitem]``Virtual Networks`` tab then the [systemitem]``XML`` tab.

. If the default network is running, stop it using the [systemitem]``X`` button in the lower left.

. Copy and paste the following XML snippet **beneath** your [systemitem]``<uuid>`` block:
+

[source, xml]
----
<forward mode="nat">
    <nat>
      <port start="1024" end="65535"/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name="virbr0" stp="on" delay="0"/>
  <mac address="52:54:00:9f:d0:0b"/>
  <domain name="suse.lab" localOnly="yes"/>
  <ip address="192.168.122.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
    <dhcp>
      <range start="192.168.122.2" end="192.168.122.254"/>
      <host mac="52:54:00:0A:CC:B8" name="suma-server" ip="192.168.122.10"/>

. Select your registration method. For this example we will register the sever with {scc}.
+

.{productname} as an extension
[NOTE]
====
The {productname} {productnumber} container is installed as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring {scc} registration keys for {micro} {microversion}, you will also need {scc} registration codes for the following extensions:

* {productname} {productnumber} Server
* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
* Retail Branch Server

====

In this section you learned the basic method for deploying a {productname} {productnumber} Server container.



== Synchronize with SUSE Customer Center 

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[[proc-admin-organization-credentials]]
.Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. In the {susemgr} {webui}, select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. In the dialog, enter [guimenu]``Username`` and [guimenu]``Password``, and confirm with btn:[Save].

When the credentials are confirmed with a check-mark icon, proceed with <<proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync>>.

[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
    If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
    This operation could take up to a few minutes.
    You can monitor the progress of the operation in section on the right ``Refresh the product catalog from SUSE Customer Center``.
    The table of products lists architecture, channels, and status information.
    For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].
+
image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Use ``Filter by product description`` and ``Filter by architecture`` to filter the liste of displayed products.
    If your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.
+

* Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
    Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Click btn:[Add Products] to start product synchronization.

After adding the channel, {productname} will schedule the channel to be synchronized.
This can take a long time as {productname} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scc} to local [path]``/var/spacewalk/`` directory of your server.

When the channel is fully synchronised, the bootstrap repository will be automatically created.
The bootstrap repository is necessary for the succesful bootstrapping of creation of the  activation key will be assciated with
the clients can be bootstrapped following the steps This completes {productname} installation and configuration, with channel preparation for the client bootstrapping.

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can continue with client registration.
For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



== Entering the container for management

To get to a shell in the pod run:
----
sudo mgrctl exec -ti bash
----
