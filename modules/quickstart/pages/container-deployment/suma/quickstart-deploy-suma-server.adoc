.Supported operating system for the Server Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {micro} {microversion}.

Container host:: A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully. An FQDN typically follows the format <host>.<domain>.com.

For instance:

* suma.example.com
* suma.fritz.box
* suma.container.lab

For additional details, refer to the section on network requirements in the Installation and Upgrade Guide, available at xref:installation-and-upgrade:network-requirements.adoc[].

== {productname} {productnumber} Installation

.Procedure: Download the Installation Media
. Locate the {productname} {productnumber} Server installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/suse-manager/.
. You will need an account with {scc} and must be logged in to download the ISO.
. Download the following file: [filename]``SUSE-Manager-Server.x86_64-SelfInstall.raw.xz`` 
. Prepare a USB fash disk or DVD for installation.
. Insert a DVD or a bootable USB stick containing the installation image for {productname} {productnumber}.
. Boot or reboot your system.
+

For detailed documentation on preparing your machines OS (virtual or physical), see link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.5/html/SLE-Micro-all/book-deployment-slemicro.html[{micro} {microversion} Deployment Guide].



.Procedure: {productname} {productnumber} Installation 
. On the the configuration welcome screen select [btn]``Confirm``.

. Read the license agreement and click [btn]``Accept` to continue.
. Select your time zone.
. Enter and confirm a password for root user.
. Read the statement about SLE Micro registration and click [btn]``Accept`` to continue.
+

.{productname} as an extension
[NOTE]
====
The {productname} {productnumber} container is installed as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring {scc} registration keys for {micro} {microversion}, you will also need {scc} registration codes for the following extensions:

* {productname} {productnumber} Server
* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
* {productname} {productnumber} Retail Branch Server
====

. Enter your {scc} Email address. 
. Enter your registration code for {micro} {microversion}.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``Extension and Module Selection`` page uncheck the **Hide Development Versions** checkbox. 
. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Server extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Server extension registration code.
. Click btn:[Next] to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``NTP Configuration`` page click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Authentication for the System`` page enter a password for the root user. Click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` page click btn:[Install].

This concludes installation of {micro} {microversion} and {productname} {productnumber} Server as an extension.



=== Update the system
. Login as *root*.

. Run **transactional-update**:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update
----

. Reboot the system.

. Login as root.



== Deploy with mgradm

.Procedure: Deploy {productname} {productnumber} with mgradm
. From the terminal run the following command replacing <suma.example.com> with your fully qualified domain name.
+

[source, shell]
----
mgradm install podman <suma.example.com>
----

. Enter a certificate and administrator account password when prompted. 
+

[NOTE]
====
The administrator account password must be at least 5 characters and less
than 48 characters in length.
====
+

. Press btn:[Enter].

. Enter the email address of the administration account. Press btn:[Enter].

. Wait for deployment to complete.

. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN, or IP address.

In this guide you learned how to deploy {productname} {productnumber} Server as a container.



== Synchronize with SUSE Customer Center 

This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the {webui} and adding your first client channel.

[[proc-admin-organization-credentials]]
.Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials
. In the {susemgr} {webui}, select menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[Organization Credentials] tab.
. Click btn:[Add a new credential].
. In the dialog, enter [guimenu]``Username`` and [guimenu]``Password``, and confirm with btn:[Save].

When the credentials are confirmed with a green check-mark icon, proceed with <<proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync>>.

[[proc-quickstart-first-channel-sync]]
.Procedure: Synchronizing with {scc}
. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard].
. From the [guimenu]``Setup Wizard`` page select the btn:[SUSE Products] tab.
    If you previously registered with {scc} a list of products will populate the table.
    This operation could take up to a few minutes.
    You can monitor the progress of the operation in section on the right ``Refresh the product catalog from SUSE Customer Center``.
    The table of products lists architecture, channels, and status information.
    For more information, see xref:reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc[Wizard].
+
image::admin_suse_products.png[scaledwidth=80%]
. Use ``Filter by product description`` and ``Filter by architecture`` to filter the list of displayed products.
    If your {sle} client is based on [systemitem]``x86_64`` architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now.
+

* Add channels to {productname} by selecting the check box to the left of each channel.
    Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules.
* Click btn:[Add Products] at the top of the page to start product synchronization.

After adding the channel, {productname} will schedule the channel to be synchronized.
This can take a long time as {productname} will copy channel software sources from the {suse} repositories located at {scc} to the local [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/`` directory of your server.

When the channel is fully synchronized, the bootstrap repository for it will be automatically created.
This is necessary for the successful bootstrapping of a client. This completes the {productname} installation and configuration, with channel preparations for bootstrapping clients.

When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can continue with the client registration.
For more instructions, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].



== Entering the container for management

To get to a shell inside the container, run the following on the host:
----
mgrctl term
----
