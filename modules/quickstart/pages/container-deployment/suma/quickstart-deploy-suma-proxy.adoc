.Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {micro} {microversion}.

Container host:: A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight and easy to move. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The host supplies the necessary resources—CPU, memory, and storage—for these containers.
