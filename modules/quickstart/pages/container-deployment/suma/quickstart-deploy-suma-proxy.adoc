.Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {micro} {microversion}.

Container host:: A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.
====



== Sync the Parent and Proxy Extension Child channels

This section presumes that you have already entered your organization credentials under the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard -> Organization Credentials] in the Servers {webui}. 
Products are listed on the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard -> Products] page. 
This channel must be fully synchronized on the server, with the child channel [systemitem]Proxy as an extension option selected.

====



[[proxy-setup-containers-generate-config]]
== Generate the Proxy Configuration

The configuration archive of the {productname} Proxy is generated by the {productname} Server. 
Each additional Proxy requires its own configuration archive.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must follow these steps prior to generating a Proxy configuration to be successful.

. Sync the correct channels from the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard -> Products] page and the [systemitem]``Proxy as an extension`` child channel.
. Create an activation key for the Proxy.
. Bootstrap the Proxy host as a {salt} minion with the Server.
====

The following tasks will be performed:

1. Generate {productname} a Proxy configuration file
2. Transfer the configuration to the container host from the Server and extract it
3. Start the Proxy with [literal]``mgrpxy``

[[proc-proxy-containers-setup-webui]]
.Task: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration using Web UI

. In the {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Proxy Configuration] and fill the required data:
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy.
. In the [guimenu]``Parent FQDN`` field type fully qualified domain name for the {productname} Server or another {productname} Proxy.
. In the [guimenu]``Proxy SSH port`` field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on {productname} Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022.
. In the [guimenu]``Max Squid cache size [MB]`` field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Typically this should be at most 60% of available storage for the containers.
. In the [guimenu]``SSL certificate`` selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for {productname} Proxy or an existing one should be used.
You can consider generated certificates as {productname} builtin (self signed) certificates.
+
Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate.
+
The CA certificates generated on the server are stored in the [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/ssl-build`` directory.
+
For more information about existing or custom certificates and the concept of corporate and intermediate certificates, see  xref:administration:ssl-certs-imported.adoc[].

. Click btn:[Generate] to register new proxy FQDN in {productname} Server and generate configuration archive with details for container host.
. After a few moments you are presented with file to download. Save this file locally.

[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-config]]
== Transfer the Proxy Configuration

The {webui} methods generate a configuration archive.
This archive needs to be made available on the Proxy container host.


.Task: Copy the Proxy configuration
. Copy the files from the server container to the server host OS:
+
----
mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz .
----

. Next copy the files from the server host OS to the proxy host: 
+
----
scp config.tar.gz <proxy-FQDN>:/root
----

. Install the Proxy with:
+ 

----

mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz
----

For installation instructions to use the archive to get the proxy containers, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/suma/proxy-container-installation.adoc[].



[[proxy-setup-containers-transfer-start]]
== Start {productname} Proxy containers

Container can now be started with the [literal]`mgrpxy` command:

[[proc-setup-containers-setup-start]]
.Procedure: Start {productname} Proxy containers

----
mgrpxy start
----

Check if all containers started up as expected by calling

----
mgrpxy status
----

Five {productname} Proxy containers should be present:

- proxy-salt-broker
- proxy-httpd
- proxy-tftpd
- proxy-squid
- proxy-ssh

And should be part of the [literal]``proxy-pod`` container pod.
