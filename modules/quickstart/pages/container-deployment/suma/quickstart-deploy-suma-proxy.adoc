This guide outlines the deployment process for the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy.
This guide presumes you have already successfully deployed a {productname} {productnumber} Server. 
To successfully deploy, you will perform the following actions:


// Add certificate tasks item
.Task: Proxy Deployment
. Review hardware requirements.
. Synchronize the {micro} {microversion} parent channel and the Proxy extension child channel on the server.
. Install {micro} {microversion} on a bare-metal machine.
. During the installation, register {micro} {microversion} along with the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension.
. Create a {salt} activation key.
. Bootstrap the Proxy as a {salt} minion.
. Generate a Proxy configuration.
. Transfers Proxy configuration from the Server to the Proxy
. Use the Proxy configuration to register the {salt} minion as a Proxy with {productname}.

.Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host
[NOTE]
====
The supported operating system for the container host is {micro} {microversion}.

Container host:: A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers.

== Sync the Parent and Proxy Extension Child channels

This section presumes that you have already entered your organization credentials under the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard -> Organization Credentials] in the Servers {webui}. 
Products are listed on the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard -> Products] page. 
This channel must be fully synchronized on the server, with the child channel [systemitem]Proxy as an extension option selected.

.{productname} {productnumber} Channel Sync for Proxy
image::setup-wizard.png[scaledwidth=80%]

.Task: Sync the Proxy Parent Channel and Proxy Extension
. In the {productname} {webui} select menu:Admin[Products].
. From the products page enter {micro} in the filter field.
. Next use the dropdown to select the required architecture. For this example {x86_64}.
. In the [systemitem]``Product Description`` field select the {micro} {microversion} checkbox then use the dropdown to select the [systemitem]``SUSE Manager Proxy Extension 5.0 x86_64 (BETA)`` extension.
. Click the btn:[+ Add products] button.
. Wait for the sync to complete.



== {micro} {microversion} Installation



.Task: Download the Installation Media
. Locate the {micro} {microversion} installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/.
. You will need an account with {scc} and must be logged in to download the ISO.
. Download the following file: [filename]``SLE-Micro-5.5-DVD-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso`` 
. Prepare a USB fash disk or DVD for installation.
. Insert a DVD or a bootable USB stick containing the installation image for {micro} {microversion}.
. Boot or reboot your system.
+

For detailed documentation on preparing your machines OS (virtual or physical), see link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.5/html/SLE-Micro-all/book-deployment-slemicro.html[{micro} {microversion} Deployment Guide].



.Task: {micro} {microversion} Installation 
. Use the arrow keys to select [systemitem]``Installation``.
. Adjust Keyboard and language. Click the [systemitem]``checkbox`` to accept the License Agreement.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Select your registration method. For this example we will register the server with {scc}.

.{productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an extension
[NOTE]
====
The {productname} {productnumber} Proxy is registered as an extension. Therefore, in addition to acquiring an {scc} registration key for {micro} {microversion}, you will also need an {scc} registration code for the following extension:

* {productname} {productnumber} Proxy
====

. Enter your {scc} Email address. 
. Enter your registration code for {micro} {microversion}.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``Extension and Module Selection`` page uncheck the **Hide Development Versions** checkbox. 
. Select the {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension [systemitem]``Checkbox``.
. Click [systemitem]``Next`` to continue.
. Enter your {productname} {productnumber} Proxy extension registration code.
. Click btn:[Next] to continue.
. On the [systemitem]``NTP Configuration`` page click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Authentication for the System`` page enter a password for the root user. Click btn:[Next].
. On the [systemitem]``Installation Settings`` page click btn:[Install].

This concludes installation of {micro} {microversion} and {productname} {productnumber} Proxy as an extension.



=== Update the system

.Task: Update the System
. Login as *root*.
. Run **transactional-update**:
+

[source, shell]
----
transactional-update

. Create an activation key for the proxy host with {micro} {microversion} as the parent channel. This key should include all recommended channels and the Proxy as an extension child channel.
. Proceed to boostrapping the proxy host as a minion.

== Bootstrap the Proxy as a Minion



[NOTE]
====
The container host for the {productname} Proxy must be registered as a salt minion to the {productname} Server.

For more information about registering a client to the {productname} Server, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
====

== Generate the Proxy Configuration

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must follow these steps prior to generating a Proxy configuration to be successful.

. Sync the correct channels from the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard -> Products] page and the [systemitem]``Proxy as an extension`` child channel.
. Create an activation key for the Proxy.
. Bootstrap the Proxy host as a {salt} minion with the Server.
