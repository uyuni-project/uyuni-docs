= Prepare Server

Before you start you need to install the {productname} Server.
The method for installing the {productname} Server varies depending on your hardware and environment.

{productname} is installed using the {sles}{nbsp}15 {unifiedinstaller}.
During the installation process, when you are prompted for which product to install, select {productname} Server.
The server does not need to have the {sles}{nbsp}15 with SAP product installed.
For more information about installing the {productname} Server, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:install-server-unified.adoc[].

When the {productname} Server is installed, set it up by running the [command]``yast2 susemanager_setup`` command from the command prompt.
The setup script prompts you to complete additional details about your server, and give you the URL to use to access the {webui}.
For more information about setup, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:server-setup.adoc[].

You need to do some configuration to set up the {productname} {webui}.
In your browser, navigate to the URL of the server, and configure your administration access to the {webui}.
For more information about setting up the {webui}, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:webui-setup.adoc[].

Now you can use the {webui} to prepare software channels and activation keys for your clients.

On the {productname} Server, add the appropriate SAP channels:
From the {webui}, add [systemitem]``SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP``.

Synchronize the {productname} Server with the {SCC}.
You can do this using the {webui}.
Add the new channel to your activation key.

To check if a channel has finished synchronizing navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and select the [guimenu]``Products`` tab.
This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized.


[NOTE]
====
Software channels can be very large.
The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours.

When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.
This gives you a backup of the original synchronization data.
