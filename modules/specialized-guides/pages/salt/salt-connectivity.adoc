[[salt-connectivity]]
= {Salt} Connectivity

Depending on the size and spreadness of the environment where {productname} is used some connectivity issues are possible.
There are no common recommendations for all the possible use cases as the environments could be very different expecially if public clouds instances are involved.



[[minions-connectivity]]
== Minions Connectivity

In case clients are losing the connection to the {productname} Server (or {productname} Proxy if involved), they are unreachable from the {productname} Server {webui} or with command line tools.
To understand such a connection issue check if the client is not reachable from the {productname} Server with [command]``salt MINION_ID test.ping``, while [command]``venv-salt-call test.ping`` (or [command]``salt-call test.ping`` if non-bundle {salt} is used on the client) is working fine on the client side.
If this is the case, it is recommended to set [literal]``tcp_keepalive`` parameters.

The parameters with the values from the example below can be used as a starting point to look for settings, which could prevent cases of connection loss without restoring for some environments.
It is recommended to put the parameters in the separate drop-in configuration file like [path]``/etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf`` or [path]``/etc/salt/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf``, depending on the minion type used on the client side.

######      Keepalive settings        ######
############################################
# ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by
# the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through
# a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is
# the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion
# without informing either party that their connection has been taken away.
# Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening.

# Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False)
# or leave to the OS defaults (-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled.
tcp_keepalive: True

# How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300
# to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (-1) is typically 7200 seconds
# on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time.
tcp_keepalive_idle: 10

# How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default -1
# to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes.
tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3

# How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default -1 to
# use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see
# /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl.
tcp_keepalive_intvl: 10

[[proxies-connectivity]]
== Proxies Connectivity

[command]``salt-broker`` service is used on {productname} Proxies to forward {salt} traffic between the {productname} Server and [command]``salt-minion`` service used on the client side.
It is possible that [command]``salt-broker`` and all the clients behind it could be affected with the same issue as the clients directly connected to the {productname} Server.
The issue could be fixed with the same parameters as recommended for the minions, but specified in [path]``/etc/salt/broker`` on each {productname} Proxy.


{productname} Proxy connectivity can also suffer when the connectivity to the {productname} Server is lost for a quite long interval.
In such a case Proxy connected clients started to retry the authentication to the [command]``salt-master`` service on the {productname} Server.
This situation could be potentially dangerous because it could lead to collecting large amount of ZeroMQ messages with authentication attemps in the interal buffer of ZeroMQ sockets used inside the [command]``salt-broker`` service.
Then, on restoring the connection to the [command]``salt-master`` all of the pending messages will be pushed to it.
It could lead to the issues on {productname} Server side with [command]``salt-master`` service, because it could be impossible to serve all the cached requests in appropriate time or even to the complete denial of the service.

To avoid such situation a set of tuning parameters is available.
As the most important one, [option]``wait_for_backend`` should be set to [literal]``True``.
This prevents opening the sockets for the clients behind the proxy while the connectivity to the [command]``salt-master`` service is not established.
In this case the messages from the clients are not collected in the internal buffers.
``drop_after_retries`` is setting the number of retries before closing the sockets to drop the cached messages.
The other parameters could help to fine tune the behavior for the environment.

[NOTE]
====
Setting timeouts, intervals and ``drop_after_retries`` to lower values are making [command]``salt-broker`` service more aggressive on detecting the connection loss to the [command]``salt-master``, so that it puts the clients behind the proxy to the conditions closer as they are connected directly to the {productname} Server.
Increasing the values could provide some benefits in case if the network channel between the {productname} Proxy and {productname} Server is not stable enough, the message buffering can provide some flexibility while re-establishing the connection.

######   ZeroMQ connection options    ######
############################################
# For more details about the following parameters check ZeroMQ documentation:
# http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-setsockopt
# All of these parameters will be set to the backend sockets
# (from the salt-broker to the salt-master)

# connect_timeout (sets ZMQ_CONNECT_TIMEOUT)
# default: 0
# value unit: milliseconds
# Sets how long to wait before timing-out a connect to the remote socket.
# 0 could take much time, so it could be better to set to more strict value
# for particular environment depending on the network conditions.
# The value equal to 10000 is setting 10 seconds connect timeout.
connect_timeout: 3000

# reconnect_ivl (sets ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL)
# default: 100
# value unit: milliseconds
# Sets the interval of time before reconnection attempt on connection drop.
reconnect_ivl: 1000

# heartbeat_ivl (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL)
# default: 0
# value unit: milliseconds
# This parameter is important for detection of loosing the connection.
# In case of value equal to 0 it is not sending heartbits.
# It's better to set to more relevant value for the particular environment,
# depending on possible network issues.
# The value equal to 20000 (20 seconds) works good for most cases.
heartbeat_ivl: 5000

# heartbeat_timeout (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT)
# default: 0
# value unit: milliseconds
# Sets the interval of time to consider that the connection is timed out
# after sending the heartbeat and not getting the response on it.
# The value equal to 60000 (1 minute) is considering the connection is down
# after 1 minute of no response to the heartbeat.
heartbeat_timeout: 10000


######   Other connection options    ######
# The following parameters are not related to ZeroMQ,
# but the internal parameters of the salt-broker.
# drop_after_retries
# default: -1
# value unit: number of retries
# Drop the frontend sockets of the salt-broker in case if it reaches
# the number of retries to reconnect to the backend socket.
# -1 means not drop the frontend sockets
# It's better to choose more relevant value for the particular environment.
# 10 can be a good choise for most of the cases.
drop_after_retries: 5

# wait_for_backend
# default: False
# The main aim of this parameter is to prevent  collecting the messages
# with the open frontend socket and prevent pushing them on connecting
# the backend socket to prevent large number of messages to be pushed
# at once to salt-master.
# It's better to set it to True if there is significant numer of minions
# behind the salt-broker.
wait_for_backend: True
