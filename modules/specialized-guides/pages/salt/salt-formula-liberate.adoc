// FIXME: where appropriate, use the "Confirm with" expression.

[[liberate-formula]]
= Liberate Formula

The liberate formula migrates systems from EL clients such as {almalinux}, {centos} 7, {oracle} 9, {rocky} 9, or even {rhel} 9 to {sll}.
With this formula the conversion will take place during the client onboarding on {productname}.



== Install the formula

Install the formula with:

----
transactional-update pkg in liberate-formula
----



== Configure {productname}



To provide all the software channels for {sll} on the {productname} Server, proceed as follows.



.Procedure: Providing SUSE Customer Center credentials

. Sign in to {scc} at https://scc.suse.com.

. Navigate to [guimenu]``My Organization``, and select your organization.

. Navigate to menu:Users[Organization Credentials] and take note of your organization username and password.

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Organization Credentials] to add the credentials to your {productname} Server.

. Click btn:[Add new credential], and enter the {scc} username and password noted in a previous step.


.Procedure: Synchronizing the SLL/SLES-ES channels:

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Products]
. Select the {sll} Channels that you will use:
+

* EL7: `SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Expanded Support 7 x86_64`
* EL8: `RHEL or SLES ES or CentOS 8 Base`
* EL9: `RHEL and Liberty 9 Base`

. Click the top right button btn:[Add products].


Initial sychronization can take considerable time. You can check progress by accessing the server machine via SSH and monitoring the logs using:

----
tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/*
----


.Procedure: Creating one Activation Key per {sll} parent channel

. Note: Activation Keys are the way to register systems and automatically assign them to the required software and configuration channels corresponding to them.
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys], and click the top right button btn:[Create key].
. In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` dialog, set the fields:
+
Description::
Enter some text describing the activation key.
Key::
Enter the identifier of the key.  For example [literal``sll9-default`` for EL 9 systems.
Note: Keys will have a numeric prefix depending on the organization, so that they are unique.
Usage::
Leave blank.
Base Channel::
Select one base channel:
+

* EL7: `RHEL x86_64 Server 7`
* EL8: `RHEL8-Pool for x86_64`
* EL9: `EL9-Pool for x86_64`

Child Channel::
Include all child channels.

Add-On system type::
Leave all blank.
Contact Method::
Default
Universal Default::
Leave unchecked.

. Click btn:[Create Activation Key].



== Add Liberate formula and assign it to activation keys

When installed, the formula can be assigned to an Activation Key by creating a System Group:

.Procedure: Assigning system group and assigning liberate formula

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups], and click the btn:[Create Group] button in top right corner.

. In the dialog, fill in the following data:
+

Name::
liberate
Description::
Systems to be converted to SUSE Liberty Linux

. From the `liberate` System Group page, navigate go to the  [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.

. Select the [guimenu]``Liberate`` formula, and click btn:[Save].
  A new tab called `Liberate` will appear.

. On the [guimenu]``Liberate`` tab, you see the [option]``Reinstall all packages after conversion`` option.
  Keep it checked if you want to reinstall all the packages during the migration.
  This way you ensure all the packages will have {suse} signatures and no previous package will be kept.
  If you do not want to change the state of your system during the migration, uncheck this option and click the btn:[Save Formula] button.
  In this case, you can re-install the packages later.

Now a system group exists that has assigned the [guimenu]``Liberate`` formula.
This formula will be applied only once to migrate the system to {sll}, even if you run it multiple times.
With the next procedure, assign the system group to the Activation Key.


.Procedure: Assigning the system group to the Activation Key

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys].

. Select the Activation Key, for example [literal]``sll9-default`` for the EL 9 systems.

. From the Activation Key page navigate to the menu:Groups[Join] tab, select the [literal]``liberate`` group, and click the btn:[Join Selected Groups] button.
  The group will be assigned to the Activation Key

.Procedure: Applying migrate directly during registration

. From the Activation Key page, navigate to the [guimenu]``Details`` tab.

. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` section, and checkb the [option]``Deploy configuration files to systems on registration``option.

. Click btn:[Update Activation Key].

When you register a system with this key it will perform the migration automatically.



== Register a new system and proceed to the migration

There are two ways to onboard (or register) a new client with the Activation Key:

With the {webui} and selecting the activation key::
This is intended for a one-off registration or for testing purposes.

With a bootstrap script with an assigned activation key::
This is intended to be used for mass registration.



=== Register with the {webui}

Technically, this will start an SSH connection to the client and run the bootstrap script to register it.

.Procedure: Registering with the {webui} and selecting the activation key

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Bootstraping].

. In the `Bootstrap Minions` dialog, fill the entries:
+

Host::
Hostname of the client to register
SSH Port::
Leave blank to use default, which is [literal]``22``
User::
Enter user or leave blank for {rootuser}
Authentication Method::
Select if you want to use [guimenu]``password`` or provide a [guimenu]``SSH Private Key``
+
  * [guimenu]``Password``:  password to access the system
  * [guimenu]``SSH Private Key``: file with the private key
  * [guimenu]``SSH Private Key Passphrase``: In case a private key was provided that requires a passphrase to unlock, provide it here
Activation Key::
Select from the menu the activation key to be used, for example [literal]``sll9-default``
Reactivation Key::
Leave blank, it will not be used here
Proxy::
Leave as [literal]``None`` if you are not using a proxy

. Click the btn:[Bootstrap] button to start the registration.

A notification will show on top of the page stating that the client is being registered.



=== Register with a bootstrap script


.Procedure: Creating bootstrap script

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Manager Configuration > Bootstrap Script].

. Fill the fields of the bootstrap script configuration dialog:
+
Uyuni/SUSE Manager server hostname::
This should be set to the hostname that the client will use to reach the server, as well as the hostname
Note: a Certificate will be used associated to this name for the client systems, as it was configured in the initial setup. If it's changed, a new certificate shall be created
SSL cert location::
Path, in the server, to the filename provided as a certificate to register it. Keep it as it is.
Bootstrap using Salt::
Select this checkbox to apply salt states, like the one we added via configuration channel. It is required to perform the migration.
Enable Client GPG checking::
Select this checkbox to ensure all packages installed come from the proper sources, in this case, {sll} signed packages.
Enable Remote Configuration::
Leave unchecked.
Enable Remote Commands::
Leave unchecked.
Client HTTP Proxy::
Leave blank. This is in case the client requires a proxy to access the server.
Client HTTP Proxy username::
Leave blank.
Client HTTP Proxy password::
Leave blank.

. Click the btn:[Update] button to refresh the [path]``bootstrap.sh`` script.


The bootstrap script generated is reachable via HTTP.
For example, for a server named [literal]``example.org`` it will be at [literal]``https://example.org/pub/bootstrap/``.
Accessing the server via SSH, the bootstrap script is available in [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/``.


.Procedure: Modifying and running the bootstrap script

. Make a copy of the bootstrap script generated on the server in [path]``/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/``.
  For example:
+

----
cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/
cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sll9.sh
----

. Edit [path]``bootstrap-sll9.sh``, and add the activation key created earlier.
  For example, [literal]``sll9-default``:
+

----
ACTIVATION_KEYS=sll9-default
----

. Run the modified [path]``bootstrap-sll9.sh`` script.
  On the client, as root, run:
+

----
curl -Sks https://example.org/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-sll9.sh | /bin/bash
----
+

  For more information about running bootstrap scripts, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc#registering.clients.bootstrap.register[].
+

// Configuration channel and software channels will be assigned automatically by the Activation Key

. Apply highstate to migrate the client to {sll}.

// The high state apply will both apply the configuration channel and migrate the machine to Liberty Linux



== For already registered clients

Software channels, system group membership, and formulas can be assigned to any already registered client.
This method makes use of the bootstrap script created above for onboarding new systems.

. In the {productname} {webui}, open the System Details page of any registered client you want to migrate to {sll}.

. Click the [guimenu]`Reactivation`` tab.
  If there is already a key listed, you can use it.
  If not, click btn:[Generate New Key], and copy the entire key.
  The key will start with [literal]``re-``.

. SSH into this client and set the environmant variable to be the key that you copied:

----
export REACTIVATION_KEY=re-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
----

. Run the bootstrap script you created above, and the system will re-register using the same profile as before, but with the newly assigned {sll} context.
