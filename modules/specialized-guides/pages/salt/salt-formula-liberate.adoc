[[liberate-formula]]
= Liberate Formula

The liberate formula converts systems from EL clients such as {almalinux}, {centos} 7, {rocky} 9, or even {rhel} 9 to {sll}.
With this formula the conversion will take place during the client onboarding on {productname}.



== Install the formula

Install the formula with:

----
zypper in liberate-formula`
----



== Configure {productname}



To provide all the software channels for {sll} on the {productname} Server, proceed as follows.



.Procedure: Providing SUSE Customer Center credentials

. Sign in to {scc} at https://scc.suse.com.

. Navigate to [guimenu]``My Organization``, and select your organization.

. Navigate to menu:Users[Organization Credentials] and take note of your organization username and password.

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Organization Credentials] to add the credentials to your {productname} Server.

. Click btn:[Add new credential], and enter the {scc} username and password noted in a previous step.


.Procedure: Synchronizing the SLL/SLES-ES channels:

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Products]
. Select the {sll} Channels that you will use:
+

* EL7: `SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Expanded Support 7 x86_64`
* EL8: `RHEL or SLES ES or CentOS 8 Base`
* EL9: `RHEL and Liberty 9 Base`

. Click the top right button btn:[Add products].


Initial sychronization can take considerable time. You can check progress by accessing the server machine via SSH and monitoring the logs using:

----
tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/*
----


.Procedure: Creating one Activation Key per {sll} parent channel

. Note: Activation Keys are the way to register systems and automatically assign them to the required software and configuration channels corresponding to them.
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Activation Keys], and click the top right button btn:[Create key].
. In the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` dialog, set the fields:
+
Description::
With some text describing the activation key
Key::
With the identifier for the key.  For example [literal``sll9-default`` for EL 9 systems.
Note: Keys will have a numeric prefix depending on the organization, so that they are unique.
Usage::
Leave blank
Base Channel::
Select one base channel:
+

* EL7: `RHEL x86_64 Server 7`
* EL8: `RHEL8-Pool for x86_64`
* EL9: `EL9-Pool for x86_64`

Child Channel::
Use [literal]``include recommended`` where available or select all if unavailable

Add-On system type::
Leave all blank
Contact Method::
Default
Universal Default::
Leave unchecked

. Click btn:[Create Activation Key]


== Add Liberate formula and assign it to activation keys

When installed, the formula can be assigned to an Activation Key by creating a System Group:

.Procedure: 

. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[System Groups], and click the btn:[Create Group] button in top right corner.

. In the dialog, fill in the following data:
+

Name::
liberate
Description::
Systems to be converted to SUSE Liberty Linux

. From the `liberate` System Group page, navigate go to the  [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.

. Select the [guimenu]``Liberate``, and click btn:[Save].
  A new tab called `Liberate` will appear.

. You can switch to the `Liberate` tab and find the `Reinstall all packages after conversion` option
         - Please keep this option selected if you want to reinstall all the packages during conversion, to ensure they have SUSE signatures and you do not keep any previous package.
         - If you prefer to not alter the state of your system during the migration, please uncheck this box. If you do so, remember to click on the `Save Formula` button. You will be able to perform the reinstallation afterwards.

We have now a System Group that has assigned the `Liberate` formula. This formula will only apply once to convert the system to SUSE Liberty Linux, even if you run it multiple times. Now it's time to assign it to the Activation Key

 - Assign the System Group to the activation key
  - Go to `Systems` -> `Activation Keys`
  - Select the Activation Key, for example `sll9-default` for your EL9 systems
    - In the Activation Key page go to `Groups` tab
      - In the Group tab go to the `Join` tab, then select the `liberate` group and click on the `Join Selected Groups` button
      The group will be assigned to the Activation Key
    - To apply the conversion directly during registration, in the Activation Key Page, go to the `Details` tab
      - Go to `Configuration File Deployment` section and select the checkbox `Deploy configuration files to systems on registration`
      - Then click on `Update Activation Key`

This way when you register a system with this key it will perform the conversion automatically

### Registering a new system and proceed to the conversion
- There are two ways to onboard, or register, a new system (a.k.a. minion) with the Activation Key
  - Onboarding a new system *using webUI* and selecting the activation key
    ```Note: This is intended for a one-off registration or for testing purposes```
    - Go to `Systems` -> `Bootstraping`
      - In the `Bootstrap Minions` page fill the entries
      - Note: this will start an SSH connection to the system and run the bootstrap script to register it
      - `Host`: Hostname of the system to onboard
      - `SSH Port`: Leave blank to use default, which is `22`
      - `User`: type user or leave blank for `root`
      - `Authentication Method`: Select if you want to use `password` or provide a `SSH Private Key`
        - `Password`: If this was selected please provide the password to access the system
        - `SSH Private Key`: If this was selected please provide the file with the private key
          - `SSH Private Key Passphrase`: In case a private key was provided that requires a passphrase to unlock, please provide it here.
      - `Activation Key`: Select from the menu the Activation key to be used, for example `sll9-default`.
      - `Reactivation Key`: Leave blank it wont be used here
      - `Proxy`: Leave as `None` if you're not using a proxy
      - Click on the `+ Bootstrap` button to start the registration
      - Note: A message will show in the top of the page stating that the system is being registered.
  - Onboarding a new system using a *bootstrap script* with an assigned Activation key
    ```Note: This is intended to be used for mass registration```
    - In the left menu, go to `Admin` -> `Manager Configuration` -> `Bootstrap Script`, to reach the bootstrap script configuration. Let's fill the fields here.
      - `Uyuni/SUSE Manager server hostname`: This should be set to the hostname that the client systems (a.k.a. minions) will use to reach the server, as well as the hostname
        - Note: a Certificate will be used associated to this name for the client systems, as it was configured in the initial setup. If it's changed, a new certificate shall be created
      - `SSL cert location`: Path, in the server, to the filename provided as a certificate to register it. Please keep it as it is.
      - `Bootstrap using Salt`: Select this checkbox to apply salt states, like the one we added via configuration channel. It is required to perform the conversion.
      - `Enable Client GPG checking`: Select this checkbox to ensure all packages installed come from the proper sources, in this case, SUSE Liberty Linux signed packages.
      - `Enable Remote Configuration`: Leave unchecked.
      - `Enable Remote Commands`: Leave unchecked.
      - `Client HTTP Proxy`: Leave blank. This is in case the client requires a proxy to access the server.
      - `Client HTTP Proxy username`: Leave blank.
      - `Client HTTP Proxy password`: Leave blank.
      - Click now in the `Update` button to refresh the bootstrap script `bootstrap.sh`
        - Bootstrap script generated is reachable via web by accesing the server path `/pub/bootstrap/`, for example for a server named `suma.suse.lab` it will be at https://suma.suse.lab/pub/bootstrap/
        - Accessing the server via SSH the bootstrap script is available in `/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/`
          - Copy the bootstrap script in `/srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/` by running `cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sll9.sh`
          - Edit `bootstrap-sll9.sh` and add the activation key you want to use, i.e. `sll9-default` to the line `ACTIVATION_KEYS=` leaving it as `ACTIVATION_KEYS=sll9-default`
          - Run the newly created bootstrap script, i.e. `bootstrap-sll9.sh`, in the machines to be registered and converted
            - A quick way to do it is by running `curl -Sks https://your.suma.server/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-sll9.sh | /bin/bash` as root in the machine
- Configuration channel and software channels will be assigned automatically by the Activation Key
- Apply high state and the minion will be migrated to SLL/SLES-ES
  - The high state apply will both apply the configuration channel and migrate the machine to Liberty Linux

### For already registered minions

Software channels, System Group Membership, and Formulas can be assigned to any already registered system.  This method makes use of the bootstrap script created above for onboarding new systems.

- Open the 'System Details of any registered system you wish to convert to SLL/SLES-ES
- Click on the 'Reactivation' tab.  If there is already a key listed, you can use this  If not, click on 'Generate New Key'. Copy the entire key, which will start with 're-'
- SSH into this client and set the environmant variable to be the key that you copied 'export REACTIVATION_KEY=re-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
- Run the bootstrap script you created above, and the system will re-register using the same profile as before, but with the newly assigned SLL/SLES-ES elements.
