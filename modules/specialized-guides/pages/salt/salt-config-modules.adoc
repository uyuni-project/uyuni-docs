= Configuration Modules

Salt uses execution and state modules to define, apply, and orchestrate configuration of your devices.
{productname} provides a set of modules called {uyuni} configuration modules, that you can use to configure both {susemgr} and {uyuni} Servers.

You can use the {uyuni} configuration modules directly or using SLS files.
They are are especially useful if you have multiple {productname} Servers, for example in Hub installations, but they are also useful for smaller installations.

For more information about using Hub, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/multi-server.adoc[].

You can use {uyuni} configuration modules to configure:

* Organizations
* Users
* User permissions
* System groups
* Activation Keys


For more information about Salt execution modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/modules.html.

For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html.



== Install Configuration Modules

The {uyuni} configuration modules are available in the [package]``uyuni-config-modules`` package.
On the {productname} Server, at the command prompt, as root, use this command:

----

----

This package also installs detailed API descriptions, indications on pillar settings, and examples.
When you have installed the package, navigate to [package]``/usr/share/doc/packages/uyuni-config-modules/``.
