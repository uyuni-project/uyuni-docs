The Virtualization Guest formula is used to configure settings for virtual machine.

Open the [guimenu]``Tuning`` pull-down checklist and select from the following virtual machine performance tuning settings:

* [guimenu]``Disable IRQ balancing``.
* [guimenu]``Disable Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM)``.
  Reduces performance overhead by not sharing memory across virtual machines.
* [guimenu]``Optimizations for KVM passed through host CPU``.
  Requires the KVM hint-dedicated option to be set on the VM definition.

When configured, click btn:[Save Formula] to save your configuration, and apply the highstate.
