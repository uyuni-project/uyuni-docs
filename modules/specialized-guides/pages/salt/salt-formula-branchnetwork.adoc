= Branch Network Formula

The Branch Network formula is used to configure the networking services required by the branch server, including DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP.

== Set Up a Branch Server Networking

The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways.
The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals.

=== Set Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN

In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the {susemgr} server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals.

This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals.
These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the {susemgr} {webui}.


.Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN

. In the {susemgr} {webui}, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. In the [guimenu]``Branch Network`` section, set these parameters:
* Keep [guimenu]``Dedicated NIC`` checked.
* In the [guimenu]``NIC`` field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN.
* In the [guimenu]``IP`` field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN.
* In the [guimenu]``Netmask`` field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN.
. Check [guimenu]``Enable Route`` if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN.
* Check [guimenu]``Enable NAT`` if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN.
* Select the [guimenu]``bind`` DNS forwarder mode.
* Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails.
* Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group.



=== Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network

In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the {susemgr} server as well as the terminals.

This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals.
These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the {susemgr} {webui}.
Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly:

* The [systemitem]``next-server`` option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work.
* The [systemitem]``filename`` option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is [path]``/boot/pxelinux``).
* The [systemitem]``domain-name-servers`` option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution.

.Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network

. In the {susemgr} {webui}, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. In the [guimenu]``Branch Network`` section, set these parameters:
* Keep [guimenu]``Dedicated NIC`` unchecked.
* Enable services on the branch serverâ€™s firewall.
    Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services.
* Select the [guimenu]``bind`` DNS forwarder mode.
* Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails.
* Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group.


== Set up Branch Server Terminal Naming

In this configuration it is required to fill at least [systemitem]``Branch Identification``.
This identifies Branch Server in Retail subsystem and is also used to better organize terminals with their respective branch servers.

.Procedure: Setting up a Branch Server Identification

. In the {susemgr} {webui}, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the [guimenu]``Formulas`` tab.
. In the [guimenu]``Terminal Naming`` section, enter the [systemitem]``Branch Identification`` string.
. Click btn:[Save] to save your changes.
. Apply the highstate.

It is also possible to set various options about terminal naming, for more information about terminal naming see xref:retail:retail-terminal-names.adoc[].
