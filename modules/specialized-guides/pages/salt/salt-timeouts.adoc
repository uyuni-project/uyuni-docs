== General {salt} timeouts


{salt} features two timeout parameters called `timeout` and `gather_job_timeout` that are relevant during the execution of {salt} commands and jobs--it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API.
These two parameters are explained in the following article.

This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable:

* A {salt} command or job is executed:
+

----
salt '*' test.ping
----
* {salt} master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the {salt} PUB channel.
* Clients take that job and start working on it.
* {salt} master is looking at the {salt} RET channel to gather responses from the clients.
* If {salt} master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and {salt} master will return a response containing all the client responses.


If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows:

. If `timeout` is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then {salt} master would trigger an aditional job (a {salt} [command]``find_job`` job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client.
. Now `gather_job_timeout` is evaluated. 
  A new counter is now triggered.
. If this new [command]``find_job`` job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then {salt} master will wait for that client's response for another `gather_job_timeout` interval before issuing the next [command]``find_job`` job.
. In case of reaching `gather_job_timeout` without having any response from the client (neither for the initial [command]``test.ping`` nor for the [command]``find_job`` job), {salt} master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients.


By default, {productname} globally sets `timeout` and `gather_job_timeout` to 120 seconds.
So, in the worst case, a {salt} call targeting unreachable clients will end up _with 240 seconds of waiting_ until getting a response.

You can configure these values differently by creating a [filename]``/etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf`` configuration file according to syntax in [filename]``/etc/salt/master.conf``.


== Presence Ping Timeouts

Before Actions are executed on {salt} clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, {productname} performs a "presence ping" command to ensure the respective `salt-minion` processes are active and able to respond.
Then, a ping gather job runs on the {salt} master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. 
Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out.

The presence ping is an ordinary {salt} command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other {salt} commands (`timeout`/`gather_job_timeout`, described above). 
Rather, it has its own parameters (`java.salt_presence_ping_timeout`/`java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout`) that can be set in [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``.

To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. 
You can configure the presence ping parameters in [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases.

A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives.
In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough.
Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen.
A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out.
Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow.

If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as [systemitem]``not available``, and is excluded from the command.
The {webui} shows a [systemitem]``minion is down or could not be contacted`` message in this case.

The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds.
Adjust the [systemitem]``java.salt_presence_ping_timeout`` parameter.
Defaults to 4 seconds.

The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds.
Adjust the [systemitem]``java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout`` parameter.
Defaults to 1 second.


== {salt} SSH Clients (SSH Push)

{salt} SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). 
{salt} SSH clients do not use {salt} PUB/RET channels but a wrapper {salt} command inside of an SSH call.
{salt} `timeout` and `gather_job_timeout` are not playing a role here.

{productname} defines a timeout for SSH connections in [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``:

----
# salt_ssh_connect_timeout = 180
----
