[[salt-monitoring]]
= Monitoring {salt} Events

In some cases the {salt} event bus could publish significant amount of events with a high rate, what could make it hard to analize.
Getting the statistics based on the events published in the {salt} event bus can help to identify possible weak points and perform {salt} internals profiling.

[[saline]]
== Saline

Saline is a powerful tool designed to function as a Prometheus exporter, enabling the collection of metrics based on events from the {salt} event bus. 
These metrics are derived from event data available on the {salt} master, similar to what is accessible through the command:  

----
mgrctl exec -ti -- salt-run state.event
----

Saline is distributed as a separate container image, [literal]``server-saline``, for use with {productname} Server. 
All related commands and operations should be executed on the {productname} Server container host system.

In addition to its role as a Prometheus exporter, Saline also provides the [literal]``saline-formula``, which simplifies configuration of Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, enhancing monitoring and visualization capabilities.

[[saline-deployment]]
== Saline deployment

To deploy Saline on the {productname} Server use [command]``mgradm upgrade podman`` with [option]``--saline-replicas 1``.
Saline can be deployed during the installation of the {productname} Server using [command]``mgradm install podman`` with [option]``--saline-replicas 1``.
The only possible values for [option]``--saline-replicas`` are ``1`` or ``0``.
The default port [option]``8216`` can be changed with specifying [option]``--saline-port NNNN`` (where [literal]``NNNN`` is a desired port number) on calling [command]``mgradm upgrade podman``.
After finishing the deployment [literal]``uyuni-server-saline@0.service`` should be configured on the {productname} Server host system.

== {salt} master configuration recommendations

It is recommended to add [option]``master_stats: True`` and adjust the value of [option]``master_stats_event_iter: 60`` if needed.
Then restart [command]``salt-master`` to get the detailed statistics of internal {salt} calls.
This can be help with tuning large scale deployment installations.

== Saline formula

To configure Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-formula-saline.adoc[Saline Formula].

== Removing Saline

To remove Saline from the {productname} Server use [command]``mgradm upgrade podman`` with [option]``--saline-replicas 0``.

== Examples of resulting Grafana dashboards

=== Uyuni Server (with Saline) dashboard

The dashboard represents {salt} events with the different views presented on the panels.

[[salt-events-panel]]
=== Salt Events

The panel represents all the {salt} events grouped by categories. [literal]``Salt events`` represents the total number of all categories of the events.

=== Minions Activity

The panel provides the minions activity status for the specified interval of times. It shows the amount of minions which were active in last minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour or considered offline on this moment of time or even ever seen (could be targeted or either responded or not) or active.

=== Salt Events by Tags and Functions

The panel provides the detailed representation of xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-monitoring.adoc#salt-events-panel[Salt Events] with the event spread by direction
The events which are send to the minions are presented on the positive side of the axis, while the events received from the minions are presented on the negative side.

=== Salt States

The panel represents states apply process events grouped by the status: succeeded, failed, causing errors or applied in the test mode.

image::saline-salt-states.png[Salt States]

=== Salt Master Stats (runs)

The panel represents the number of internal calls grouped by function, which are exposed with {salt} stats.

image::saline-salt-master-stats-runs.png[Salt Master Stats (runs)]

=== Salt Master Stats (avg. duration)

The panel represents the average duration of internal calls grouped by function, which are exposed with {salt} stats.

image::saline-salt-master-stats-durations.png[Salt Master Stats (avg. duration)]

== Saline State Jobs dashboard

The dashboard represents {salt} state apply process, it can be used for detailed monitoring of the internals of state apply process initiated for a number of targets.

=== Salt State Jobs (instant)

The panel represents an instant view of the state functions calls represented in the table view.

image::saline-salt-state-jobs.png[Salt State Jobs (instant)]

=== Salt States Profiling

The panel provides the table of state functions calls with the detailed profiling data that can be used for state optimization.
