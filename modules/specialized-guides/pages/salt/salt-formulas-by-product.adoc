== Install Formulas with Zypper

Formulas are provided in the {productname} pool software channel.


[IMPORTANT]
====
If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide, and could result in the formula being used instead of the state.
Always check states and formulas to avoid name clashes.
