[[salt.ssh]]
= Salt SSH


Salt SSH allows Salt commands and states to be issued directly over SSH.
SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client.

For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/.



== SSH Connection Methods

In {productname} there are two SSH connection methods, `ssh-push` and `ssh-push-tunnel`.
In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call.

In the `ssh-push` method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created.

In the `ssh-push-tunnel` method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel.
The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using `/etc/hosts` aliasing.
Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client.



== Salt SSH Integration

As with all Salt calls, {productname} invokes `salt-ssh` via the `salt-api`.

Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client.
{productname} keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the [literal]``uyuni`` roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the {webui}.
The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the [option]``roster-file`` option.
For the registered clients [option]``roster`` set to `uyuni` is used instead to get the roster from the database with `uyuni` salt roster module.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not recommended to run [command]``salt-ssh`` as [literal]``root`` user. This can cause permission issues the next time {productname} tries to use Salt SSH.
Use [command]``mgr-salt-ssh``, which changes the effective user to [literal]``salt`` and avoids file permission issues.
If you want to use [command]``mgr-salt-ssh`` with a user other than [literal]``root``, the user should have the permission to change effective user to [literal]``salt``.
====

[command]``mgr-salt-ssh`` uses [option]``roster`` set to [literal]``uyuni`` by default, if neither [option]``roster`` nor [option]``roster-file`` specified in the command line.
It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation.


== Authentication

Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication.
{productname} uses both methods:

Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping.
During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made.
The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event.
This password is not stored.

All other common Salt calls use key authentication.
During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client [path]``/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file.
Subsequent calls no longer require a password.



[[salt.ssh.user]]
== User Account

The user for Salt SSH calls made by {productname} is taken from the `ssh_push_sudo_user` setting.
By default, the user is root.

[NOTE]
====
If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh.
====

If the value of `ssh_push_sudo_user` is not root, then the `--sudo` options of `salt-ssh` are used.
For this user you must configure the `NOPASSWD` option in the [path]``sudoers`` file.
At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example:

----
<USER> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6
----



== HTTP Redirection

The `ssh-push-tunnel` method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel.
This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server.

This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL:

[pass]
----
https://suma-server:1233/repourl...
----

You can alias the suma-server hostname to [literal]``localhost`` in [path]``/etc/hosts``:
----
127.0.0.1       localhost    suma-server
----

The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects `localhost:1233` on the client to `suma-server:443`:

[pass]
----
ssh ... -R 1233:suma-server:443
----

This means that the package manager will actually connect to `localhost:1233`, which is then forwarded to `suma-server:443` by the SSH tunnel.

The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client.

Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case.



== Call Sequence

Salt SSH calls run in this sequence:

. Set `roster` parameter to `uyuni` for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call
.. Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is `ssh-push-tunnel`
.. Compute the `ProxyCommand` if the client is connected through a proxy
.. Create Roster content
. Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client)
. Execute a synchronous `salt-ssh` call using the API
. Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client)

The roster content contains:

* `hostname`
* `user`
* `port`
* `remote_port_forwards`: The remote port forwarding SSH option
* `ssh_options`: Other ssh options:
** `ProxyCommand`: If the client connects through a proxy
* `timeout`: defaults to 180 seconds
* `minion_opts`:
** `master`: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is `ssh-push-tunnel`
* `ssh_pre_flight`: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command
* `ssh_pre_flight_args`: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client



== Bootstrap Sequence

This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master.
While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls.

Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client.
This happens for both regular and SSH clients.



. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client.
. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the ``mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd`` runner.
    The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH.
    If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops.
. Generate pillar data for bootstrap.
    The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client.
. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client.
    You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command:
+
----
mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file=<temporary_bootstrap_roster> minion state.apply certs,<bootstrap_state>`
----
+
For `bootstrap_state`, use `bootstrap` for regular clients or `ssh_bootstrap` for SSH clients.


The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client:

* If you are using the `ssh-push-tunnel` contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option.
* If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the `ProxyCommand` option.
    This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through.


Pillar data contains:

* mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master
* mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the {productname} Server
* minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap
* contact_method: The connection type
* mgr_sudo_user: The user for `salt-ssh`
* activation_key: If selected
* minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key
* minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key
* proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected

The roster content contains:

* `hostname`
* `user`
* `password`
* `port`
* `remote_port_forwards`: the remote port forwarding SSH option
* `ssh_options`: other SSH options:
** `ProxyCommand` if the client connects through a proxy
* `timeout`: defaults to 180 seconds
* `ssh_pre_flight`: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: [path]``/usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh``)
* `ssh_pre_flight_args`: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client

== Proxy Support

Salt SSH works with {productname} Proxy  by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next.
This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection.

image::salt-ssh-proxy-multi-hop.png[]


{productname} uses `ProxyCommand` to redirect SSH connections through proxies.
This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host.
The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon.

`ProxyCommand` replaces a TCP/IP connection.
It does not perform any authorization or encryption.
Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port.

This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway.
In this example `netcat` is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output:

image::salt-ssh-proxycommand.png[]


The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use:

. {productname} initiates the SSH connection.
. `ProxyCommand` uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies.


This example uses `ProxyCommand` with two proxies and the `ssh-push` method:
----
# Connect the server to the first proxy:
/usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel  proxy1

# Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option:
/usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22  proxy2
----

image::salt-ssh-push-push-plain-sequence.png[]

This example uses `ProxyCommand` with two proxies and the `ssh-push-tunnel` method:
----
# Connect the server to the first proxy:
/usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel  proxy1

# Connect the first proxy to the second:
/usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel  proxy2

# Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy:
/usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client

# Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22).
This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command.
/usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client
----

== Users and SSH Key Management

To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called `mgrsshtunnel`.
When `mgrsshtunnel` connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of ``/usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd``.
This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of `scp`, `ssh`, or `cat` commands.

The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence:

. The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in ``/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id`.
. Each proxy has its own key pair in ``/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push`.
. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server.
. The client authorizes its own key.

image::salt-ssh-push-ssh-keys.png[]



== Repository Access with a Proxy

When {productname} connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either `ssh-push` or `ssh-push-tunnel`.

In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information.

In the `ssh-push` method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS.
This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client.

image::salt-ssh-push-repo-access.png[]

In the `ssh-push-tunnel` method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel.

image::salt-ssh-push-tunnel-repo-access.png[]



== Proxy Setup

When the `spacewalk-proxy` package is installed on the proxy, the `mgrsshtunnel` user is created.

The initial configuration with ``configure-proxy.sh`` occurs using this sequence:

. An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported.
. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy.
. The ``ssh`` daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the ``mgrsshtunnel`` user.
    This is done by the ``mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init`` script, which is called from ``configure-proxy.sh``.
    It does not have to be manually invoked.

The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy.
The first endpoint tried is ``https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub``.
If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy.

If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and ``https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey`` is tried instead.

If an SSH key exists at ``/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub`` on the server it is returned.

If the public key does not exist because ``salt-ssh`` has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the ``mgrutil.ssh_keygen`` runner.

[NOTE]
====
Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with ``/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id``.
The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time.

[[salt.ssh.key_rotation]]
== Rotate SSH keys

The SSH key is used on [literal]``salt-ssh`` managed systems.
Additionally, it is used on {productname} Proxies for the user [systemitem]``mgrsshtunnel``.
Normal systems managed with the {salt} [literal]``default`` method are not affected and do not have this key configured.


.Procedure: Rotating SSH keys

. On the {productname} Server, as user [systemitem]``root``, change to user [systemitem]``salt``:
+

----
su -s /bin/bash - salt
----

. Create a new SSH key:
+

----
ssh-keygen -N "" -t rsa -q -f /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id
----

. Copy the public key into the {salt} filesystem to make it usable in a {salt} state:
+

----
cp /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id.pub /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/
----

. Change back to user [systemitem]``root`` again:
+

----
exit
----

. Rollout the new key to all systems that need it.
  Applying the [literal]``util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key`` state will limit  the changes to [literal]``salt-ssh`` managed systems and proxies:
+

----
salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key
mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key
----

. Move the old key away and make the new key the standard key.
  Rename [literal]``mgr_ssh_id`` key to [literal]``disabled_mgr_ssh_id`` and [literal]``new_mgr_ssh_id`` key to [literal]``mgr_ssh_id`` in the SSH keystore of the user [systemitem]``salt`` as well as in the {salt} filesystem for the public keys:
+

----
su -s /bin/bash - salt
cd .ssh
mv mgr_ssh_id disabled_mgr_ssh_id
mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub
mv new_mgr_ssh_id mgr_ssh_id
mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub
cd /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/
mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub
mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub
----

. OPTIONAL: When containerized proxies exist, re-create the configuration to get the new SSH key into the proxy configuration.
  Restart the containers with the new configuration.
  It is also possible to change the existing configuration on the podman host ([literal]``ssh.yaml``).
  Change the value of [literal]``server_ssh_key_pub`` with the content of the current [literal]``mgr_ssh_id.pub``.

. To remove the disabled keys from the [path]``authorized_keys` files of the [literal]``salt-ssh`` managed systems and the proxies, apply the state a second time:
+

----
salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key
mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key
----
