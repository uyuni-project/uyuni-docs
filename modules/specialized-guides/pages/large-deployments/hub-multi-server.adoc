= Multiple Servers with Hub to Manage Large Scale Deployments

If you need to manage a large number of clients, in most cases you can do so with a single {productname} Server, tuned appropriately.
However, if you need to manage tens of thousands of clients, you might find it easier to use multiple {productname} Servers, in a hub, to manage them.

{productname} Hub helps you manage very large deployments.
The typical Hub topology looks like this:

To copy contents between servers, you can use Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS).
ISS allows you to export data from one server (source) and import it on another (target) server.
For more information, see xref:administration:iss_v2.adoc[].
