If you need to manage a large number of clients, in most cases you can do so with a single {productname} Server, tuned appropriately.
However, if you need to manage tens of thousands of clients, you might find it easier to use multiple {productname} Servers, in a hub, to manage them.

{productname} Hub helps you manage very large deployments.
The typical Hub topology looks like this:

* One central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server.
* One or more additional {productname} Servers, registered to the Hub.
  This document refers to these additional servers as peripheral servers.
* Any number of clients registered to the peripheral servers.
  Some of these clients can act as {productname} Proxies.

To copy contents between servers, you can use Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS).
ISS allows you to export data from one server (source) and import it on another (target) server.
For more information, see xref:administration:iss_intro.adoc[].

This chapter gives more details about Hub deployment.
