= Hub Online Synchronization


== Introduction 

Hub online synchronization reuses the existing repository syncing mechanism and synchronizes channels in the peripheral servers from the repositories on the hub server.

Once the connection between hub and peripheral servers is established, the hub server becomes the main source of data for the peripheral server, effectively replacing {scclongform}.

The main characteristics of this feature are:

* There can only be one hub server per connection, with one or more peripheral servers.

* Each peripheral server can only have one peripheral server. 

* Content can be synchronized on regular basis, or on demand.



== Types of registration

Hub online synchronization is configured from menu menu:Admin[Hub Configuration].

Configuration process uses token which uniquely identifies peripheral server's connection to the hub.

There are two ways to create a token, link them here...


=== Token generation initiated on the peripheral server

//A token is generated on the peripheral server and passed it to the administrator of the hub server.

.Procedure:
. On the peripheral server, go to menu:Admin[Hub Configuration > Access Tokens].
. Click button btn:[Add token] and select option [literal]``Issue new token``.
. In the field [literal]``Server FQDN`` on the form that opens type the FQDN of the hub server that will be using this token.
. Click btn:[Issue].
. A new form with the succesfuly generated token appears and button btn:[Copy].

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
The only time token is displayed is at the time of its creation.
Make sure to copy it and store safely 

=== Token generation initiated from the hub server

From hub to peripheral::
The administrator of the hub server has also an admin account on the peripheral server and can initiate token generation.
