= Hub Online Synchronization


== Introduction 

Hub online synchronization reuses the existing repository syncing mechanism and synchronizes channels in the peripheral servers from the repositories on the hub server.

Once the connection between hub and peripheral servers is established, the hub server becomes the main source of data for the peripheral server, effectively replacing {scclongform}.

The main characteristics of this feature are:

* There can only be one hub server per connection, with one or more peripheral servers.

* Each peripheral server can only have one peripheral server. 

* Content can be synchronized on regular basis, or on demand.



== Types of registration

Hub online synchronization supirts two types of registration of the peripheral server on the hub server. 
The registration is reliant on te exstance of a token which can be generated in two different ways.
The type of token generation also determines the type of registration. 

From peripheral to hub:: 
A token is generated on the peripheral server and passed it to the administrator of the hub server.

From hub to peripheral::
The administrator of the hub server has also an admin account on the peripheral server and can initiate token generation.
