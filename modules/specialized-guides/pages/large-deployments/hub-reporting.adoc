= Hub Reporting

The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral {productname} Servers.
The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub.
The data is made available for external Reporting Tools.

== Architecture

The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the {productname} Hub system.
It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them.
Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system.
In summary:

- the DB in {productname} Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers,
- the DB in {productname} Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub,
- the DB in peripheral {productname} Server stores its own data,
- the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any {productname} Server.

== Setup

The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server.
The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA).
The whole {productname} Hub environment should be using only one Root CA.

=== Create a DB user for the reporting

Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created.
For doing that, it is possible to use ``uyuni-setup-reportdb-user``.

----
usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options]

options:
  --help
            show this help message and exit
  --non-interactive
            Switches to non-interactive mode
  --dbuser=DBUSER
            Report DB User
  --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD
            Report DB Password
  --add
            Add the new user
  --delete
            Delete the user
  --modify
            Set a new password
----

== Database Schema

The schema exports the most important tables from the main {productname} Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report.

Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables.

Every table gets an extra id column (`mgm_id`) specifying the {productname} server which provided the data.
On a single {productname} Server this column has the standard value `1` which represent [literal]``localhost``.
On the {productname} Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database.

Another common additional field is `synced_date`, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main {productname} Server database.

Schema documentation can be found on the Left Navigation Bar -> menu:Help[Report Database Schema].

== Data Generation and Update

{productname} uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub.

To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called `update-reporting-default`.
It is executed by default daily at midnight.

On the {productname} Hub there is a second schedule which is important.
To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name `update-reporting-hub-default` is executed daily at 1:30 AM.

All times are in the local timezone of the server.
If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules.
Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and `update-reporting-hub-default` is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.



=== Tuning Reporting Jobs

[[reportdb-batch-size]]
=== `report_db_batch_size`

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Description          | The maximum number of rows fetched and written from one database to the other in one shot.
| Tune when            | Out of memory errors or on processing speed problems.
| Value default        | 2000
| Value recommendation | 500 - 5000
| Location             | [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``
| Example              | `report_db_batch_size = 4000`
| After changing       | Check xref:memory-usage[memory usage].
                         Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change.
|===

[[reportdb-hub-workers]]
=== `report_db_hub_workers`

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Description          | The maximum number of workers requesting data from peripheral servers on a hub at the same point in time.
| Tune when            | The number of peripheral servers increases significantly (more than 100), or a faster synchronization is required.
| Value default        | 2
| Value recommendation | 2 - 10
| Location             | [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf``
| Example              | `report_db_hub_workers = 5`
| After changing       | Check xref:memory-usage[memory usage].
                         Monitor memory and cpu usage of the hub closely before and after the change.
                         Also monitor the load, cpu and memory usage of the reporting database of the hub.
| Notes                | All the data collected from the peripheral server must be written into the hub reporting database.
                         Tuning that database could increase the performance as well.
