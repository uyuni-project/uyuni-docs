= Hub Reporting

The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral {productname} Servers. The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub.
The data is made available for external Reporting Tools.

== Architecture
The main database is a PostgresDB in the {productname} Hub system. 
It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and eventually aggregates them. 
Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary:

- the DB in {productname} Hub stores, collects and eventually aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers,
- the DB in {productname} Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub,
- the DB in peripheral {productname} Server stores its own data,
- the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any {productname} Server.

== Setup
The reporting database and schema are setup by default using the local postgresql server.
The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network.

=== Create a DB user for the reporting

Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created.
For doing that, it is possible to use ``uyuni-setup-reportdb-user`` .

== Database Schema

The schema exports the most important tables from the main {productname} Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report.

Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables.

Every table gets an extra id column (`mgm_id`) specifying the {productname} server which provided the data. 
On a single {productname} Server this column has the standard value `1` which represent "localhost." 
On the {productname} Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database.

Another common additional field is `synced_date`, which represent the time when the data were exported from the main {productname} Server database.
