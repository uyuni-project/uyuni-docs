When XMLRPC API is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.
For examples, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-auth.adoc[].

Logs are saved in ``/var/log/hub/hub-xmlrpc-api.log``.
Logs are rotated weekly, or when the log file size reaches the specified limit.
By default, the log file size limit is 10{nbsp}MB.
