= Hub Requirements

To set up a Hub installation, you require:

* One central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server.
* One or more additional {productname} Servers, registered to the Hub.
  This document refers to these additional servers as peripheral servers.
* Any number of clients registered to the peripheral servers.
* Ensure the Hub Server and all peripheral servers are running {productname}{nbsp}5.0 or higher.



[[lsd-hub-reqs-server]]
== Hub Server

Deploy the central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server, with the [command]``mgradm`` command.
Add [option]``--hubxmlrpc-replicas 1`` to the [command]``mgradm install`` command line.
For example:

----
mgradm install podman suma.example.com --hubxmlrpc-replicas 1
----

For more information about hub server deployment, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-install.adoc[].


[NOTE]
====
The Hub Server must not have clients registered to it.
Clients should only be registered to the Peripheral Servers.
====



[[lsd-hub-reqs-certs]]
=== SSL Certificates

The Hub Server's and the Peripheral Servers' SSL certificates must be signed by the same CA.
There are two ways to fulfill this requirement:

* Use third party certificates.
* Deploy the Hub Server first and use it to generate the certificates for the Peripheral Servers.
  For more information, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-reqs.adoc#lsd-hub-reqs-gencerts[].




[[lsd-hub-reqs-gencerts]]
=== Generate the Certificates for Peripheral Servers



[NOTE]
====
If you will use third party provided Certificates, you can skip this procedure.
====

.Procedure: Generating the Certificates for Peripheral Servers

. From the container host, enter the shell in the Hub Server container with:
+
----
mgrctl term
----

. On the command line, run [command]``rhn-ssl-tool`` for each Peripheral Server (replace placeholders such as [literal]``COUNTRY``, [literal]``STATE``, [literal]``example.com``, etc. with values from your environment):
+

----
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir="/root/ssl-build" --set-country="COUNTRY" \
  --set-state="STATE" --set-city="CITY" --set-org="ORGANIZATION" \
  --set-org-unit="ORGANIZATION UNIT" --set-email="name@example.com" \
  --set-hostname="HOSTNAME" --set-cname="example.com"
----

. Copy these files to the Peripheral Server host:
+
* [path]``/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT``
* [path]``/root/ssl-build/HOSTNAME/server.crt``
* [path]``/root/ssl-build/HOSTNAME/server.key``




== Peripheral Servers



Deploy the peripheral servers with [command]``mgradm``.
For more information about deploying with [command]``mgradm``, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/suma/server-deployment-suma.adoc[].


.Procedure:Deploying and Registering Peripheral Servers

. Prepare Peripheral Server hosts.

. On each Peripheral Server host:

* Copy [path]``RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT`` to [path]``/etc/pki/trust/anchors/`` and run [command]``update-ca-certificates``.
* Deploy the Peripheral Server with:
+
----
mgradm install podman --ssl-ca-root RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT \
  --ssl-server-cert server.crt --ssl-server-key server.key
----

. On each Peripheral Server host register Peripheral Server to the Hub Server:
+

----
mgradm hub register --api-server <HUB_FQDN> --api-user <HUB_ADMIN> \
  --api-password <HUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
----
+

Peripheral Servers must be registered to the Hub Server as foreign clients.
Standard registration methods cannot be used.


[NOTE]
====
Peripheral Servers must be registered to the Hub Server directly, do not use a proxy.
====

Optionally, it is possible to register the podman container host as a standard client ({salt} minion) and manage it from {productname} Server.

// You need credentials to access the XMLRPC APIs on each server, including the Hub Server.



Now the XMLRPC API is available and reportdb synchronization will take place.
