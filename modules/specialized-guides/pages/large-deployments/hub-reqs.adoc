= Hub Requirements

To set up a Hub installation, you require:

* One central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server.
* One or more additional {productname} Servers, registered to the Hub.
  This document refers to these additional servers as peripheral servers.
* Any number of clients registered to the peripheral servers.
* Ensure the Hub Server and all peripheral servers are running {productname}{nbsp}5.0 or higher.



== Hub Server

Deploy the central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server, with the [command]``mgradm`` command.
Add [option]``--hubxmlrpc-replicas 1`` to the [command]``mgradm install`` command line.
For more information about deploying with [command]``mgradm``, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/suma/server-deployment-suma.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
The Hub Server must not have clients registered to it.
Clients should only be registered to the Peripheral Servers.
====



[[lsd-hub-reqs-certs]]
=== SSL Certificates

The Hub Server's and the Peripheral Servers' SSL certificates must be signed by the same CA.
There are two ways to fulfill this requirement:

* Use third party certificates.
* Install Hub Server first and use it to generate the certificates for the Peripheral Servers.
  For more information, see xref:specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-reqs.adoc#lsd-hub-reqs-gencerts[] .

=== Generate the Certificates for Peripheral Servers



[NOTE]
====
If you will use third party provides Certificates, you can skip this procedure.
====

.Procedure: Generating the Certificates for Peripheral Servers

. From the container host, enter the shell in the Hub container with:
+
----
mgrctl exec -ti /bin/sh
----

. On the command line, run [command]``rhn-ssl-tool`` for each Peripheral Server (replace placeholders with value from your environment):
+

----
rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir="/root/ssl-build" --set-country="COUNTRY" \
  --set-state="STATE" --set-city="CITY" --set-org="ORGANIZATION" \
  --set-org-unit="ORGANIZATION UNIT" --set-email="name@example.com" \
  --set-hostname=<hostname> --set-cname="example.com"
----

. Copy these files to the Peripheral Server host:
+
* [path]``/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT``
* [path]``/root/ssl-build/<hostname>/server.crt``
* [path]``/root/ssl-build/<hostname>/server.key``




== Peripheral Servers



You will deploy the peripheral servers with [command]``mgradm``.
For more information about deploying with [command]``mgradm``, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/suma/server-deployment-suma.adoc[].


.Procedure:Deploying and Registering Peripheral Servers

. Prepare Peripheral Server hosts.

. On each Peripheral Server host:

* Copy [path]``RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT`` to [path]``/etc/pki/trust/anchors/`` and run [command]``update-ca-certificates``.
* Deploy the Peripheral Server with:
+
----
mgradm install podman --ssl-ca-root RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT \
  --ssl-server-cert server.crt --ssl-server-key server.key
----

. Register Peripheral Server to the Hub Server:
+

----
mgradm hub register --api-server <HUB_FQDN> --api-user <HUB_ADMIN> \
  --api-password <HUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
----
+

Peripheral Servers must be registered to the Hub Server as foreign clients.
Standard registration methods cannot be used.

Peripheral Servers must be registered to the Hub Server directly, do not use a proxy.

Optionally, it is possible to register the podman container host as a standard client ({salt} minion) and manage it from {productname} Server.

// You need credentials to access the XMLRPC APIs on each server, including the Hub Server.
