= Hub Requirements

To set up a Hub installation, you require:

* One central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server.
* One or more additional {productname} Servers, registered to the Hub.
  This document refers to these additional servers as peripheral servers.
* Any number of clients registered to the peripheral servers.
* Ensure the Hub Server and all peripheral servers are running {productname}{nbsp}5.0 or higher.



== Hub Server

Deploy the central {productname} Server, which acts as the Hub Server, with [command]``mgradm``.
For more information about deploying with [command]``mgradm``, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/deployment-as-a-container.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
The Hub Server must not have clients registered to it.
Clients should only be registered to the peripheral servers.

== Peripheral Servers

Deploy the peripheral servers with [command]``mgradm``.
For more information about deploying with [command]``mgradm``, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/deployment-as-a-container.adoc[].

Peripheral servers must be registered to the Hub Server as clients.
When you register the peripheral servers, assign them the appropriate [guimenu]``{productname} Server`` software channel as their base channel.
The peripheral servers must be registered to the Hub Server directly, do not use a proxy.

For more information about registering clients, see xref:client-configuration:registration-webui.adoc[].


You need credentials to access the XMLRPC APIs on each server, including the Hub Server.
