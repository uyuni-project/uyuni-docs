= FAQ {productname} on the AWS Marketplace
:toc:

To cater to customers who favor a cloud-centric billing approach, SUSE has added the **{productname} Server Family** listing to the AWS Marketplace.

This document introduces the advantages of running {productname}, complemented by the convenience of a new monthly pricing model available through the AWS Marketplace.

== The listing

**What is the "{productname} PAYG" listing on the AWS Marketplace?**::
  By selecting the {productname} listing from the AWS Marketplace, customers can deploy {productname} to their cloud environment with the advantage of having monthly billing via AWS.

**Where do I find the {productname} listings?**::
  The listings can be found on the AWS Marketplace, there are currently two listings:

  * {productname} (Non-EU and non-UK only)
  * {productname} (EU and UK only)

**Why are there two listings and which one should I use?**::  
  We have two listings for {productname}, "EU and UK only" and "non-EU and non-UK only". You should select the listing that reflects where your AWS account is billed

**Are these listings available in all countries?**::
  The {productname} listing on AWS is not available to purchase in all countries.
  Your billing country is based on the AWS Account IID used to do the deployment.
  Please read the addendum at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact {productname} via the AWS Marketplace.

**My AWS account is in the USA, but I want to deploy {productname} in another AWS region, a region that is in a country where I currently cannot transact, is this possible?**::
  Yes. If your AWS account is billed to one of the allowed countries, it is possible to deploy {productname} in any AWS region.

**Is this listing available in China?**::
Whilst it is not possible to transact/bill {productname} via the AWS Marketplace in China, it is possible to deploy into AWS regions in China. 
Please read the addendum at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact {productname} via the AWS Marketplace.

**Is there still a BYOS listing for {productname} in the Marketplace?**::
**Yes**, for customers that wish to utilize {productname} with existing annual subscriptions, the BYOS {productname} listing is available.

**Is there a {payg} listing available for the {productname} Proxy Server?**::
**No**. If a {productname} proxy is required as part of the architecture, it is suggested to use the containerized proxy.


== Billing

**I have an existing {productname} subscription; can I use this on AWS?**::
// We need to document the migration from BYOS -> AWS
BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) {productname} deployments are support on AWS, however, billing will not be via the AWS Marketplace. Once the existing subscription term ends, you can purchase {productname} via the AWS Marketplace and follow the documentation to migrate your deployment so that it will be billed via the AWS Marketplace.

**I have an existing deployment covered by a {productname} subscription; can I use this new listing in AWS for new deployments?**::
**Yes**, the listing works independently from your existing {productname} subscriptions. Please remember that support routes may be different for deployments using your existing subscription and those billed via the AWS Marketplace.

**Tell me more about how __the billing for {productname}__ works via AWS?**::
When purchasing {productname} via the AWS Marketplace, the billing is as follows:

* Billing is monthly and handled via the AWS Marketplace.
* Managed instances are recorded hourly.
* The peak usage total is calculated for the month.
* There is a monthly usage charge for each instance in the count.
* There is a 10 instance minimum, if the peak usage count is less than 10, the charge will be for 10 instances.

**I have existing {sles} for SAP instances procured via the AWS Marketplace, will I be charged for these clients?**::
**No**. {sles} for SAP __on-demand__ instances when purchased via the AWS Marketplace, included LCM entitlement for {productname}. Providing there are at least 10 {sles} for SAP instances, there will be no additional charge to manage these with this {productname} listing.

**Is there a way to try {productname} before purchasing?**::
If using the {productname} {payg} listing in the AWS Marketplace, billing will commence from the time of deployment / applicable clients are on-boarded to {productname}.
+

There is a Bring-Your-Own-Subscription (BYOS) listing for {productname} in the AWS Marketplace which can be used, a trial subscription key can be otained via the SUSE website. This deployment cannot be directly converted to allow billing via the AWS Marketplace.
+

To benefit from monthly billing via the AWS Marketplace, the BYOS {productname} deployment will need to be migrated to a {productname} deployed via the AWS Marketplace.

**How does SUSE calculate the ‘number of managed instances’ to bill for?**:: 
Billing is based on the number of managed clients. 
Below are three examples of how the average node count is calculated, check the table below for the detail.  

* **Static usage**:   
Using {productname} on 10 nodes, for 1 month with no additional nodes added in the month.  

* **Bursting Model**:  
Using {productname} on 10 nodes for three weeks in the month,  bursting to 30 nodes for one week. 

* **Transient model**:  
A temporary deployment of {productname} on 20 nodes for two weeks (336 hours)

**Are special commercial terms available?**::
Depending on the deployment, it may be possible to secure special commercial terms.(e.g. An annual subscription). This will be handled via an AWS Private offer, please contact SUSE for more information. 

**Can my spend on {productname} count towards my AWS Enterprise Discount Program?**:: 
**Yes**, it can. Please contact your AWS Sales Team for more details. 

**How do I purchase {productname} / LCM subscriptions for additional managed-instances?**:: 
Once {productname} has been deployed from the listing on AWS and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase to manage additional instances. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of instances {productname} is managing. Just on-board additional instances to {productname} as needed, this will be reflected in your Marketplace bill. 

**Is this an annual commitment, will it auto-renew?**:: 
By default, the {productname} listing in AWS is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is on-going for as long as {productname} is deployed. 
+
It is possible to set up an annual commitment via an AWS Private Offer, these will need to be reviewed and renewed at the end of the term, or the deployment will drop back to the default monthly billing cycle. 

**Is there a volume discount / tiered pricing built in to the AWS Listing?**:: 
There is no volume discount available at this time. 

**I no longer require support, how can I end the subscription?**:: 
If you no longer require support there are 2 options: 

* Unregister all systems from the {productname} Server 
* Terminate the {productname} instance

== Technical (Billing)  

**Do I need any special or additional infrastructure to setup {productname} billing via AWS Marketplace?**::
**No**, all components needed to handle the billing are part of the {productname} code-base. 

**What is the deployment mechanism for {productname} on the AWS Marketplace?**:: 
The AWS Marketplace listing for {productname} is deployed via an (Amazon Machine Image) AMI. 

**What version of {productname} is installed when using the Marketplace listing?**:: 
The AWS Marketplace listing for {productname} is tied to a specific version of {productname} (4.3.8 at launch).  Future listings will typically include the latest version available at the time AMI creation.  Please check the listing for further information. 

**I need a prior version of {productname} installed, can I still use the listing?**:: 
**No**. There is no choice over the {productname} version when deploying using the AWS Marketplace listing.  If a prior version of {productname} is required, this will need to be installed manually using the standard documentation. 

**How often is the listing updated (including the version of {productname} etc.)?**:: 
The Marketplace listing is tied to a specific version of {productname}, usually the latest version available at the time of the listing.
+

Typically, the listing in AWS Marketplace is updated quarterly, or more frequently if there are security issues.  
+

It is worth noting that the image update process may not be fully aligned to the {productname} product maintenance releases (every 6-8 weeks), so {productname} instances should be patched after deployment.  

**I have multiple independent SUSE Manager deployments, each running a separate install of the AWS Marketplace listing for SUSE Manager, how is this billed?**:: 
As the SUSE Manager deployments are independent, each is billed separately from the next. 

**I have purchased multiple SUSE products from the AWS Marketplace (i.e. Rancher, NeuVector and SUSE Manager), does the AWS Marketplace billing method still work?**:: 
**Yes**.  The billing mechanism for the various products is independent.  Each deployment will be billed separately via the AWS Marketplace. 

**I already have an existing SUSE Manager deployment, how can I get this deployment to bill via the AWS Marketplace?**:: 
Existing deployments cannot be directed converted or updated to provide billing via the AWS Marketplace. 
+

It is easy to migrate your existing SUSE Manager deployment to a SUSE Manager instance which has been deployed from and can bill via the AWS Marketplace.


== Technical (Product)

**Can I migrate an existing SUSE Manager instance to a PAYG version?**:: 
**Yes**, it is possible to use a migration script to migrate the SUSE Manager database to a new PAYG instance of SUSE Manager from the AWS Marketplace.  This has the benefit of maintaining event history for managed instanced. Salt states and synchronized packages are also moved as part of this process. 
+

If event history does not need to be retained as part of the move, customers can simply deploy a new SUSE Manager instance from the AWS Marketplace and re-onboard all clients. 

// Add link to docs on this process
 
**How do I obtain support?**:: 
It is very simple to open a support case with SUSE for SUSE Manager.   
+

Create a ‘supportconfig’ via SUSE Manager instance CLI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center at the following  
+

link:https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport[]
+

Providing the billing is active, a support case will be opened. 

**Is there any difference between the SUSE Manager product on the AWS Marketplace compared to the versions I can run in my own data center?**:: 
The SUSE Manager product available in the AWS Marketplace is the same product, with the same functionality that you would run on-premises or with a manual installation.   
+

The only exception being the ability to bill via the AWS Marketplace and connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure for SUSE Manager product updates. 

**Does the SUSE Manager instance need to run 24/7?**:: 
To ensure continuity with support it is recommended that the SUSE Manager instance always remains active.   

**How do I get fixes and updates for SUSE Manager, do I need a subscription key?**:: 
SUSE Manager, when deployed via the AWS Marketplace listing (monthly billing) will automatically connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure in AWS, no separate SUSE Manager Subscription Key is required.  
+

Updates to the SUSE Manager instance can be applied from those channels using standard SUSE tooling (i.e. zypper). 

**Is the use of SUSE Manager Hub supported with this listing?**:: 
**Yes**.  SUSE Manager Hub is recommended for customer with more than 10,000 managed clients.
+

As long as the SUSE Manager Hub instance has no connected clients, there will be no cost for the SUSE Manager software components / Hub etc. 
+

Billing will occur from the downstream SUSE Managed instance, where managed clients are connected. 

**Can I manage Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) clients in AWS with SUSE Manager PAYG?**:: 
To manage SLES (for SAP) BYOS clients, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES (for SAP) subscriptions will be required.  These credentials should be added to the SUSE Manger configuration to enable this functionality. 

**I have a hybrid setup, can I manage instances / clients outside of AWS?**:: 
**Yes**, it is possible to manage clients, in the cloud, on premises or both.  
+

To enable management of SUSE client in an on-premises datacenter, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES (for SAP) subscriptions will be required.   
+

These credentials should be added to the SUSE Manger configuration to enable this functionality. 

**Are there additional charges for using a SUSE Manager Proxy?**:: 
With Hybrid Network egress charges may apply, so consider the use of a proxy.   
+

To reduce network costs, SUSE recommend the use of the containerized proxy.   
+

Please note: Whilst the SUSE Manger Proxy usage is included as part of the {payg} SUSE Manager subscription, an LCM+ subscription will be billed if the proxy is also a managed client. 

**Can I have a SUSE Manager node on premises and bill via the AWS Marketplace.**:: 
**No**. To benefit from AWS Marketplace billing, the SUSE Manager instance must reside on the AWS Cloud. Any SUSE Manager instances on premises require their own subscriptions.
