= Monitoring Large Scale Deployments


You can monitor your {productname} environment using Prometheus and Grafana.
{productname} Server and Proxy are able to provide self-health metrics.
You can also install and manage a number of Prometheus exporters on Salt clients.

Prometheus and Grafana packages are included in the {productname} Client Tools for
ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]
 {sle}{nbsp}12, {sle}{nbsp}15, {rhel}{nbsp} 6, {rhel}{nbsp} 7, {rhel}{nbsp} 8 and openSUSE 15.x.
endif::[]

ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
 {sle}{nbsp}12, {sle}{nbsp}15, {centos}{nbsp} 6, {centos}{nbsp} 7, {centos}{nbsp} 8 and openSUSE 15.x.
endif::[]

You need to install Prometheus and Grafana on a machine separate from the {productname} Server.
We recommend you use a managed Salt client as your monitoring server.
