== Do I need any special or additional infrastructure to set up {productname} billing via the cloud marketplaces?

No, all components needed to handle the billing are part of the {productname} {payg} code base.

== What is the deployment mechanism for {productname} {payg} on the cloud marketplace?

The cloud marketplace listing for {productname} {payg} will deploy a {productname} instance, together with the embedded billing engine.

== What version of {productname} is installed when using the marketplace listing?

The cloud marketplace listing for {productname} {payg} is tied to a specific version of {productname} (4.3.8 at launch).  Future listings will typically include the latest version available at the time of product/image creation. Please check the listing for further information.

== I need a prior version of {productname} installed; can I still use the listing?

No, there is no choice over the {productname} version when deploying using the cloud marketplace listing. If a prior version of {productname} is required, this will need to be installed manually using the standard documentation and {byos} billing.

== How often is the listing updated (including the version of {productname} etc.)?

The Marketplace listing is tied to a specific version of {productname}, which is the latest version available at the time of the listing.

Typically, the listing in the cloud marketplace is updated quarterly, or more frequently if there are security issues.

It is worth noting that the image update process may not be fully aligned to the {productname} product maintenance releases (every 6-8 weeks), so {productname} {payg} instances should be patched regularly after deployment.

== I have purchased multiple {payg} - {payglongform} SUSE products from the cloud provider marketplace (i.e. Rancher, NeuVector and {productname}), does the marketplace billing method still work?

Yes, the billing mechanism for the products is independent. Each deployment will be billed separately via the cloud marketplace.

== I already have an existing {productname} deployment; how can I get this deployment to bill via the cloud marketplace?

Existing deployments *cannot* be directly converted or updated to provide billing via the cloud marketplace. To benefit from monthly billing, {productname} {payg} must be deployed directly from the cloud marketplace listing.
