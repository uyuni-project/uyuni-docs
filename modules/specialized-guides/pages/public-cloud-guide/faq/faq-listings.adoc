== What is the “{productname}” listing on the cloud marketplaces?

By selecting the {productname} listing from the Cloud Marketplace, customers can deploy {productname} to their cloud environment with the advantage of having monthly billing via the Cloud Provider.

Customers still have the option of using {productname} BYOS (Bring your own subscription), for which subscriptions and billing is handled directly by {suse}.


== Where do I find the {productname} listings?

The listings can be found in the {availability} Marketplaces, there are two listings:

// Hard coding these as it is the only specific reference, otherwise we use the variable.
On the AWS Marketplace, you will find the following:

* {productname} Server Family (Non-EU and non-UK only)
* {productname} Server Family (EU and UK only)

On the Azure Marketplace, you will find:
* {productname} with 24x7 Support
* {productname} with 24x7 Support (EMEA Orders Only)

For the purposes of this FAQ, we will refer to these listings as {productname}.


== Why are there 2 listings and which one should I use?

We have 2 listings for {productname}, "EU and UK only / EMEA Orders Only" and "non-EU and non-UK only", you should pick the listing that reflects in which country your {availability} account gets billed.

//why the two?. If i remember right there is an answer in the Rancher or NV FAQ which we should copy


== Are these listings available in all countries?

The {productname} listing on the cloud is not available to purchase in all countries. In case it is not available in your country you can still use the BYOS option.

Your billing country is based on the {availability} Account ID used to do the deployment.

== My cloud account is in the USA, but I want to deploy {productname} in another region, a region that is in a country where I currently cannot transact, is this possible?

If your Cloud Provider account is billed to one of the allowed countries, it is possible to deploy {productname} in any region.

== Is this listing available in China?

It is not possible to transact/bill {productname} via {availability} Marketplaces in China. It is possible to deploy into regions in China.

This means you can deploy {productname} in a region in China if your billing is performed in a country that has the PAYG option available. Please see the addendum at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact {productname} via the Cloud Marketplace.

== Is there still a BYOS listing for {productname} in the Marketplace?

Yes, for customers that wish to use an existing annual {productname} subscription, the BYOS {productname} listing is available.

== Is there a PAYG listing available for the {productname} Proxy Server?

If a {productname} Proxy is required as part of the architecture, it is suggested to use the containerized proxy.
See the SUSE documentation at:
link:https://documentation.suse.com[documentation.suse.com] menu:Select[{productname} > {productname} {{productnumber}} > Installation and Upgrade guide > Installation > {productname} Proxy > Install Containerized Proxy] 

From the subscription point of view, {productname} Proxy is a managed client.

== The listing shows pricing information for {productname} node management and a separate price for monitoring. Do I need to subscribe twice if I need monitoring?

There is no need to subscribe twice. Subscribing to the listing in the Cloud Provider Marketplace allow the {productname} instance to perform metered billing for {productname} usage.

If you onboard an instance and enable {productname} monitoring, there is a monthly charge for management and another charge for monitoring.
