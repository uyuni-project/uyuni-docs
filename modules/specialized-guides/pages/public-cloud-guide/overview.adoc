Additionally, it assumes that you are installing the {productname} Server on a single cloud instance.
These procedures have been tested on {awslongform}, {azure}, and {gcplongform}.

{payglongform} or {payg} services currently work on both {awslongform} and {azure}.
Solutions are also in development for {gcplongform}.
