This guide shows you the fastest way to get {productname} up and running in a public cloud environment using on-demand, {payglongform} ({payg}), or {byoslongform} ({byos}) services.
{productname} Proxy in a public cloud is only supported using {byos} services.

// Is this statement correct regarding PAYG?
Additionally, it assumes that you are installing the {productname} Server on a single cloud instance.
These procedures have been tested on {awslongform}, {azure}, and {gcplongform}.

[NOTE]
====
{payglongform} or {byoslongform} services currently work on both {awslongform} and {azure}.
====
