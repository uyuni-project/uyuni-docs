= Initial Setup

This guide shows you the fastest way to get {productname} up and running in a public cloud using on-demand or {byos} services.
We have tested using {productname} on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation.

There are three main methods of using {productname} on a public cloud service.

{byoslongform} ({byos})::
Most public cloud providers make a {byos} image of {productname} available.
This means you do not need to install {productname}, just set up the server or proxy.
You will need to have {suse} product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required.
The public cloud documentation in the {productname} documentation suite assumes you are using this method.

Virtual machine on public cloud::
In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install {productname} in a virtual machine, using the {unifiedinstaller}.
You will need to have {suse} product entitlements before you begin.
You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local {productname} installation.

On-demand {sles} pay as you go (PAYG) image::
Most public cloud providers make {sles} available as a BYOS image.
This means that {sles} is pre-installed, and you can install {productname} on top, using the {unifiedinstaller}.
You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local {productname} installation.
You will need to have {suse} product entitlements before you begin.
Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs.



== {productname} Server

If you are using the {byos} method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a {productname} instance.
Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the {productname} Server {byos} images by searching for ``suse manager``.
In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs.
In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace.

Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware  and networking requirements in xref:installation-and-upgrade:pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].

When you have your virtual machine ready, and the {byos} image installed, you need to set up {productname} Server.
This is done in the same way as a local installation, using {yast}.
When you have completed {productname} setup, you need to activate the public cloud module.
You can then complete the setup in the {productname} {webui}.



== {productname} Proxy

You must use the {byos} method.
Start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launch a {productname} Proxy instance.
Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the {productname} Proxy {byos} images by searching for ``suse manager proxy``.
In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs.
In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace.

Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware  and networking requirements in xref:installation-and-upgrade:pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].

When you have your virtual machine ready, and the {byos} image installed, you need to set up {productname} Proxy.
This is done in the same way as a local installation, using {suse} setup tools.
When you have completed {productname} Proxy setup, you need to activate the public cloud module.
// You can then complete setup in the {productname} {webui}.
