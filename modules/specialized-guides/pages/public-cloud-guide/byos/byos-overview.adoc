== {byoslongform} ({byos})

{byoslongform} ({byos}) images are useful if you already have a support contract with SUSE and want to move your workloads to the public cloud.
An instance launched from a {byos} image is equivalent to a physical machine that just received a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation from the {sles} installation image.

After creation:

* use ``registercloudguest`` to register the instance with the SUSE-operated update infrastructure in the cloud framework, or
* use the command ``SUSEConnect`` to register the system with {scclongform} using the entitlements you already have.

.Obtaining a SUSE Manager Server Subscription for {byos}
[IMPORTANT]
====
To obtain a SUSE Manager Server Lifecycle subscription, customers must send an email to susemanagerkey@suse.com, including proof of running at least 10 instances of SLES for SAP BYOS. 
Proof can be a screenshot of the relevant section of the cloud console. 
The subscription key is valid for one year, and customers can renew it by providing updated proof of their instances at the end of the period.
====

Connect your system to your own running RMT or {productname} infrastructure in the same way you connect systems in your data center.

{byos} instances make it easier to manage extensions such as ``LTSS`` or ``kernel live-patching``.
Extensions for {payg} instances can only be used in conjunction with {productname}.
