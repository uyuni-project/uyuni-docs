= BYOS Guide

== Bring your own subscription (BYOS)

Bring your own subscription (BYOS) images are useful if you already have a support contract with SUSE and want to move your workloads to the public cloud. 
An instance launched from a BYOS image is equivalent to a physical machine that just received a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation from the {sles} installation image. 

After creation: 
* use ``registercloudguest`` to register the instance with the SUSE-operated update infrastructure in the cloud framework, or
* use the command ``SUSEConnect`` to register the system with {scc} using the entitlements you already have. 

Connect your system to your own running RMT or {productname} infrastructure in the same way you connect systems in your data center.

BYOS instances make it easier to manage extensions such as ``LTSS`` or ``kernel live-patching. 
Extensions for PAYG instances can only be used in conjunction with {productname}.
