== {byoslongform} ({byos})

{byoslongform} ({byos}) images are useful if you already have a support contract with SUSE and want to move your workloads to the public cloud.
An instance launched from a {byos} image is equivalent to a physical machine that just received a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation from the {sles} installation image.

After creation:

* use ``registercloudguest`` to register the instance with the SUSE-operated update infrastructure in the cloud framework, or
* use the command ``SUSEConnect`` to register the system with {scclongform} using the entitlements you already have.

Connect your system to your own running RMT or {productname} infrastructure in the same way you connect systems in your data center.

{byos} instances make it easier to manage extensions such as ``LTSS`` or ``kernel live-patching``.
Extensions for {payg} instances can only be used in conjunction with {productname}.
