= Configure {payglongform} Behind Proxy


When in PAYG scenario, SUSE Manager needs to use sudo to run instance-flavor-check, the tool to identify if a machine is PAYG or not.

If the customer is using an http proxy, they need to make sure this setting is correctly managed by sudo, because by default most environment variables are disregarded.

One way for the customer to do it, is to add a file /etc/sudoers.d/keep_proxy.conf with the following content:

----
# Preserve any possible proxy configuration
Defaults env_keep += "http_proxy https_proxy no_proxy"
This ensures the proxy related environment variables are preserved during the privileges escalation.
----
