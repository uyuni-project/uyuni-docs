== BYOS and PAYG support

Regardless of the public cloud service you use or the plan you choose, SUSE has you covered with support. Where you get support is dependent on whether you **bring your own subscription** (BYOS) or you use SUSE products **on-demand** (PAYG). 

BYOS::
BYOS instances are supported by SUSE under the terms of your SUSE subscription. For an overview of SUSE's support subscriptions, refer to https://www.suse.com/support/.

PAYG::
{productname} PAYG instances include support by SUSE.

To open a ticket for {payg} see: link:https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport

Public Cloud Guide::
For more information on cloud products and support see the {suse} public cloud guide:

Public Cloud Information Tracker (Pint)::
The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images SUSE publishes and servers that are part of the SUSE operated update infrastructure. PINT is available at link:https://pint.suse.com/[pint.suse.com]  and provided as an API and command-line tool with the **python3-susepubliccloudinfo** package from the Public Cloud Module repository.

== Collecting system information with supportconfig
  
To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command `supportconfig`. The command-line tool is provided by the package `supportutils` which is installed by default.

Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate `supportconfig` plug-ins. When `supportconfig` is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. `supportconfig` plug-ins are stored in the directory `/usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/`.

The following procedure shows how to create a Supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly.

.Procedure: Creating a supportconfig archive

. Run supportconfig as root. Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list:
+

.Options:
----
-E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE

Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E)
Company name (-O)
Your name (-N)
Your phone number (-P)

-i KEYWORDS, -F
Limits the features to check. 
The placeholder KEYWORDS is a comma-separated list of case-sensitive keywords. 
Get a list of all keywords with supportconfig -F.
----

. Wait for the tool to complete the operation.

. The default archive location is `/var/log`, with the file name format being **scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz**

== Opening a new support case

To open a new support case for your cloud pay-as-you-go instance, you need to generate a **supportconfig** file and then follow the steps listed on:

== Billing services and troubleshooting


=== billing-data-service

Serves billing data from {productname} for the **CSP-billing-adapter**.
The service is reachable at: 

- http://localhost:18888/
- http://localhost:18888/metering

This service is maintained by the {productname} team.
This service only logs to **systemd journal**.

**Billing services** must be running or **spacewalk** will refuse to start.



=== csp-billing-adapter-service

This service reports the billing data to the cloud provider (AWS, AZURE, GCP).
These logs are stored in:

*  `/var/log/csp_billing_adapter.log`

Additional status information can be located in:

*  `/var/lib/csp-billing-adapter/csp-config.json`

This service is maintained by public cloud team.



=== mgr-check-payg.service

This service checks if **billing-data-service** is installed and running.
It also checks if the **csp-billing-adapter-service** is installed and running.
If these services are not running or installed it will attempt to install and start the service.

Consequences:: 
If one of the previous billing services is not running and cannot be installed or started **spacewalk** will refuse to start.

Check `journalctl -u mgr-check-payg.service` for additional issues.

=== Continuous Compliance checks

. The **payg-dimension-computation** taskomatic task must be active.

. Is the billing server running at http://localhost:18888/ ?

. Is the **csp-billing-adapter.service** running?

. What is the status of the **csp-billing-adapter** located in `/var/lib/csp-billing-adapter/csp-config.json`?

The following files and packages are checked for tampering::
* Billing-data-service
* Csp-billing-adapter-service
* Python3-csp-billing-adapter
* Python3-csp-billing-adapter-local
* Python3-csp-billing-adapter-amazon
* python3-csp-billing-adapter-azure

Failed Checks::
Failed checks are logged in:

* `/var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log`
* `/var/log/hrn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`

Consequences::
. No more actions will be executed.
. **Reposync** will stop syncing channels.
