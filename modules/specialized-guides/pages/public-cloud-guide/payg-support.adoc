== {byos} and {payg} Support

Regardless of the public cloud service you use or the plan you choose, {suse} has you covered with support. 
Where you get support is dependent on whether you **{byoslongform}** ({byos}) or you use {suse} products **on-demand** ({payg}). 

{byos}::
{byos} instances are supported by {suse} under the terms of your {suse} subscription. 
For an overview of {suse}'s support subscriptions, refer to https://www.suse.com/support/.

{payg}::
{productname} {payg} instances include support by SUSE.
To open a ticket for {payg}, see https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport.

Public Cloud Guide::
For more information on cloud products and support, see the {suse} public cloud guide: link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/pre-example.html[SUSE Public Cloud Guide]

Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT)::
The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images {suse} publishes and servers that are part of the {suse} operated update infrastructure. 
PINT is available at link:https://pint.suse.com/[pint.suse.com] and provided as an API and command-line tool with the [literal]``python3-susepubliccloudinfo`` package from the Public Cloud Module repository.


== Collecting System Information with `supportconfig`
  
To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command `supportconfig`. 
The command-line tool is provided by the package `supportutils` which is installed by default.

Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate `supportconfig` plug-ins. 
When `supportconfig` is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. 
This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. 
`supportconfig` plug-ins are stored in directory [path]``/usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/``.

The following procedure shows how to create a Supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly.


.Procedure: Creating a Supportconfig Archive

. Run [literal]``supportconfig`` as root. 
  Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. 
  Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list:
+
.Options:
----
-E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE

Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E)
Company name (-O)
Your name (-N)
Your phone number (-P)

-i KEYWORDS, -F
Limits the features to check. 
The placeholder KEYWORDS is a comma-separated list of case-sensitive keywords. 
Get a list of all keywords with supportconfig -F.
----
+
. Wait for the tool to complete the operation.

. The default archive location is `/var/log`, with the file name format being **scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz**




== Opening a New Support Case

To open a new support case for your cloud {payglongform} instance, you need to generate a **supportconfig** file and then follow the steps listed on:

== Billing Services and Troubleshooting


=== billing-data-service

This service serves billing data from {productname} for the **CSP-billing-adapter**.
The service is reachable at: 

- http://localhost:18888/
- http://localhost:18888/metering

This service is maintained by the {productname} team.
This service only logs to **systemd journal**.

**Billing services** must be running or **spacewalk** will refuse to start.



=== csp-billing-adapter-service

This service reports the billing data to the cloud provider (AWS, AZURE, GCP).
These logs are stored in:

*  `/var/log/csp_billing_adapter.log`

Additional status information can be located in:

*  `/var/lib/csp-billing-adapter/csp-config.json`

This service is maintained by public cloud team.



=== mgr-check-payg.service

This service checks if **billing-data-service** is installed and running.
It also checks if the **csp-billing-adapter-service** is installed and running.
If these services are not running or installed it will attempt to install and start the service.

Consequences:: 
If one of the previous billing services is not running and cannot be installed or started **spacewalk** will refuse to start.

Check `journalctl -u mgr-check-payg.service` for additional issues.



=== Continuous Compliance Checks

. The **payg-dimension-computation** taskomatic task must be active.

. Is the billing server running at http://localhost:18888/ ?

. Is the **csp-billing-adapter.service** running?

. What is the status of the **csp-billing-adapter** located in `/var/lib/csp-billing-adapter/csp-config.json`?


The following files and packages are checked for tampering::
* Billing-data-service
* Csp-billing-adapter-service
* Python3-csp-billing-adapter
* Python3-csp-billing-adapter-local
* Python3-csp-billing-adapter-amazon
* python3-csp-billing-adapter-azure


Failed Checks::
Failed checks are logged in:

* `/var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log`
* `/var/log/hrn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`

Consequences::
. No more actions will be executed.
. **reposync** will stop synchronizing channels.
