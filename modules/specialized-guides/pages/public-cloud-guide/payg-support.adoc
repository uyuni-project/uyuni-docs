== {byos} and {payg} support


Regardless of the public cloud service you use or the plan you choose, {suse} has you covered with support. 
Where you get support is dependent on whether you **{byoslongform}** ({byos}) or you use {suse} products **on-demand** **{payglongform}** ({payg}). 

{byos}::
{byos} instances are supported by {suse} under the terms of your {suse} subscription. 
For an overview of {suse}'s support subscriptions, refer to https://www.suse.com/support/.

{payg}::
{productname} {payg} instances include support by SUSE.
To open a ticket for {payg}, see https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport.

Public Cloud Guide::
For more information on cloud products and support, see link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/public-cloud.html[SUSE Public Cloud Guide].

Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT)::
The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images {suse} publishes and servers that are part of the {suse} operated update infrastructure. 
PINT is available at link:https://pint.suse.com/[pint.suse.com] and provided as an API and command-line tool with the [literal]``python3-susepubliccloudinfo`` package from the Public Cloud Module repository.


== Collecting system information
  
To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, run the command:

----
mgradm support config
----

The default archive location is [path]``/var/log``, with the file name format being **scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz**



== Opening a new support case

To open a new support case for your cloud {payglongform} instance, you need to generate a **supportconfig** file and then follow the steps listed on:

== Billing services and troubleshooting


=== billing-data-service

This service serves billing data from {productname} for the **CSP-billing-adapter**.
The service is reachable at: 

- http://localhost:18888/
- http://localhost:18888/metering

This service is maintained by the {productname} team.
This service only logs to **systemd journal**.

**Billing services** must be running or **spacewalk** will refuse to start.



=== csp-billing-adapter-service

This service reports the billing data to the cloud provider (AWS, AZURE, GCP).
These logs are stored in:

*  `/var/log/csp_billing_adapter.log`

Additional status information can be located in:

*  `/var/lib/csp-billing-adapter/csp-config.json`

This service is maintained by public cloud team.



=== uyuni-payg-timer

This service checks if **billing-data-service** is installed and running.
It also checks if the **csp-billing-adapter-service** is installed and running.
If these services are not running or installed it will attempt to install and start the service.

Consequences:: 
If one of the previous billing services is not running and cannot be installed or started **spacewalk** will refuse to start.

Check `journalctl -u uyuni-payg-timer.service` for additional issues.



=== Continuous compliance checks

.Procedure: Compliance checks
[role=procedure]
____
. Is the billing server running at http://localhost:18888/ ?

. Is the **csp-billing-adapter.service** running?

. What is the status of the **csp-billing-adapter** located in `/var/lib/csp-billing-adapter/csp-config.json`?


Failed Checks::
Failed checks are logged in:

* `/var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log`
* `/var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`

Consequences::
* No more actions will be executed.
* `reposync` will stop synchronizing channels.
