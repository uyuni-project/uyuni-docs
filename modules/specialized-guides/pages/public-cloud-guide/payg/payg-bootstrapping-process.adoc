= {payg} Client connections and bootstrapping

== Managing and bootstrapping PAYG and BYOS images

PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Images::
Connecting and bootstrapping PAYG images is supported and can be done without additional prerequisites.


BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) Images::
Bootstrapping BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the bootstrapping process with {productname} to ensure a smooth and error-free connection.

* If you have SCC credentials ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images.

**Do not** register PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center.
Only BYOS instances should be registered against the SUSE Customer Center.

**Registering PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved**.  PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update server when added to your cloud service provider {productname} instance.
