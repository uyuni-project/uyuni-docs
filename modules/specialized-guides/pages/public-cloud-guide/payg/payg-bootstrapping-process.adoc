== Managing PAYG and BYOS Images in the Bootstrapping Process

PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Images::
Bootstrapping PAYG images is supported and can be done without additional prerequisites.


BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) Images::
Bootstrapping BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription.


[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images.

* Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the bootstrapping process to ensure a smooth and error-free process.
