== Managing PAYG and BYOS Images in the Bootstrapping Process

PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Images::
Bootstrapping PAYG images is supported and can be done without additional prerequisites.


BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) Images::
Bootstrapping BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Important: Do not register PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center.
Registering PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved. Only register BYOS instances. PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images.

* Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the bootstrapping process to ensure a smooth and error-free process.
