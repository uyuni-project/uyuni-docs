= Support

Regardless of the public cloud service you use or the plan you choose, SUSE has you covered with support. Where you get support is dependent on whether you **bring your own subscription** (BYOS) or you use SUSE products **on-demand** (PAYG). 

BYOS::
BYOS instances are supported by SUSE under the terms of your SUSE subscription. For an overview of SUSE's support subscriptions, refer to https://www.suse.com/support/.

PAYG::
{productname} PAYG instances include support by SUSE. If you have a problem, always contact your CSP for assistance. They provide 1st and 2nd level support, and will work with SUSE for L3 support as required.

Public Cloud Guide::
For more information on cloud products and support see the {suse} public cloud guide:

Public Cloud Information Tracker (Pint)::
The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images SUSE publishes and servers that are part of the SUSE operated update infrastructure. PINT is available at link:https://pint.suse.com/[pint.suse.com]  and provided as an API and command-line tool with the **python3-susepubliccloudinfo** package from the Public Cloud Module repository.
