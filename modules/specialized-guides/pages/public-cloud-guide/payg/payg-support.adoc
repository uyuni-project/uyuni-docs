= Support

Regardless of the public cloud you use and the plan you choose, SUSE has you covered with support. Support is dependent on whether you "bring your own subscription" (BYOS) or you use SUSE Linux Enterprise "on-demand" (PAYG). 

BYOS::
BYOS instances are supported by SUSE under the terms of your SUSE subscription. For an overview of SUSE's support subscriptions, refer to https://www.suse.com/support/.

PAYG::
Regular PAYG instances include support through the cloud service provider which in turn is supported by SUSE. If you have a problem, always contact your CSP for assistance. They provide 1st and 2nd level support, and will work with SUSE for L3 support as required.
