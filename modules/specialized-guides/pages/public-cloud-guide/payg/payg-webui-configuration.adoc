====
instance-flavor-check Tool::
The **instance-flavor-check** tool is an essential component that comes pre-installed by default. Its presence is crucial, as it determines the status of PAYG instances. When invoked, this tool identifies and categorizes the system as a PAYG instance. By default this tool is configured to run on a schedule named **update-payg-default**.

update-payg-default schedule task::
Navigate to the menu:Admin[Task Schedules] to find the **update-payg-default** task. By default, this task is set to run at 10-minute intervals. Its primary function is to monitor the presence of all running PAYG instances by executing the **instance-flavor-check tool**.
