== Network Configuration

Before initiating `yast2 susemanager_setup`, ensure the network is correctly configured for {azure}.

// (Azure requirement, not ours).
For {productname} {payg} setup it is required, that a new Virtual Network and a new subnet is configured.
It is impossible to setup the instance in an existing network.
When you setup new clients which should be managed, take care that you put them into the private subnet which is configured with {productname} {payg}.


[NOTE]
====
If you want to manage systems in an already existing network, you must configure **peering**.

For more information, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-connect-virtual-networks?tabs=portal#create-virtual-network-peer[Azure tutorial].
====


.Procedure: Network Configuration
. Ensure the network configuration aligns such that `hostname -f` yields the identical name as the reverse DNS lookup of the private IP address. For instance, when executing `nslookup 10.0.0.X`.

. Insert the private IP with its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into `/etc/hosts`. For example: +
`10.0.0.4   instancename.internal.cloudapp.net`

. Edit `/etc/sysconfig/network/config` and append `internal.cloudapp.net` to `NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST`.

. Execute `netconfig update`.

. Subsequently, `hostname -f` should return the same FQDN as obtained from `nslookup 10.0.0.X`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When adding new virtual machines (VMs), such as {sles} 15 SP5, it's crucial to ensure that they are configured within the same subnet as the SUSE Manager instance. This step is essential for successful network setup and integration.

Additionally, be mindful of the geographical restrictions associated with your plans. Make sure to utilize the appropriate Azure accounts which correspond to the specific geographic zones of your project.

== Configure Storage
. Configure storage with the **suma-storage** tool. 
** For help see: `suma-storage --help`
This tool simplifies creating the storage disk device and database device.

. Use `lsblk` to see the names of your disk devices.
You will see a list of partitions that were created when we configured the {azure} image.

** Root partition 100 GB
** Spacewalk storage 500 GB
** Database storage 80 GB

. Format the command in the following manner: 
+

----
suma-storage <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>]

#For example: 

suma-storage /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1
----
+

[NOTE]
====
This command will create the following storage locations:

```
/pgsql_storage
/pgsql_storage/pgsql
```

```
/manager_storage
/manager_storage/spacewalk
```

```
/var/spacewalk
/var/cache/rhn
/var/lib/spacewalk
```
====

.Run setup

Execute `yast2 susemanager_setup` as root.

For more information on a typical {productname} installation, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:server-setup.adoc[Server Setup].
