== Managing Connections and Registering {payg} and {byos} Images

{payg} ({payglongform}) Images::
Connecting and registering {payg} images is supported and can be done without additional prerequisites.

{byos} ({byoslongform}) Images::
Registering {byos} images requires {scc} ({scclongform}) credentials beforehand. 
If a user attempts to onboard a {byos} image without providing {scc} credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Always verify the type of image ({payg} or {byos}) prior to initiating the registration process with {productname} to ensure a smooth and error-free connection.

* If you have {scc} credentials ensure your {scc} credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing {byos} images.

**Do not** register {payg} instances with the {scclongform}.
Only {byos} instances should be registered against the {scclongform}.

**Registering {payg} instances with the {scclongform} or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved**.  
{payg} instances are automatically registered against the correct update server when added to your cloud service provider {productname} instance.

== Starting Up Additional {payg} {suse} Products in {azure}

For more information on using {suse} {payg} products such as {sle} in the public cloud see: link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/cha-intro.html[SUSE Linux Enterprise Public Cloud Guide]


== Establishing a {payg} {sle} Connection With {productname} {payg}

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to recognize that there is a difference between **{payglongform} connections** and **bootstrapping**. 
Bootstrapping is also known as **client registration**.

Once you have started up your {productname} {payg} instance and refreshed products you can add **{payglongform} connections** via the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go] btn:[+Add Pay-as-you-go] button. 
This action links your {productname} {payg} instance with additional {payg} products on {azure}. 

**Bootstrapping** or **client registration** is the process of onboarding clients in {productname}. 
The registration process installs the appropriate client tools and provides full management functionality.

To manage your clients, start by **establishing connections** and then proceed to **bootstrap** your clients. 
These two actions are the steps required for initiating and completing the client onboarding process.

.Procedure: Connecting {sle} {payg} Instances to {productname} {payg}

. Return to the {productname} Server {webui}.

. Navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > {payglongform}] and click the btn:[+Add {payglongform}] button.

. Add a description.

. Complete the instance SSH connection data:
  * Host: `CSP URL of the machine`
  * SSH Port: `22`
  * User: `root`
  * Password: `<password>`
  * SSH Private Key

. Click btn:[Create] and wait for the sync to finish.

. Proceed to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Products] to access your {payg} SUSE Linux Enterprise products.


== Register Clients

Now that you have established connections to the {productname} {payg} instance you can register them as clients. 
To learn how to register various clients see: xref:client-configuration:registration-methods.adoc[Client Registration Methods]


=== Minion Timeouts

Inbound and outbound connections to {azure} are released after 4 minutes of being idle. 
This affects minion connectivity, especially when your {productname} server is in {azure} and you have some on-premises minions. 
If a connection is idle for more than 4 minutes, connectivity is lost.

To resolve this issue on your minions: 

.Procedure:
. Create a new configuration file at i.a. [path]`/etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/keepalive.conf` and enable [literal]`keepalive`:
+
----
tcp_keepalive: True
tcp_keepalive_intvl: 5
tcp_keepalive_idle: 10
tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3
----

. Restart the [literal]`venv-salt-minion service`.
