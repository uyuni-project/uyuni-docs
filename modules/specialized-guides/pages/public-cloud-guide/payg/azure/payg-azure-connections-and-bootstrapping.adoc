= {payg} Client connections and Client Registration

== Managing connections and registering PAYG and BYOS images

PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Images::
Connecting and registering PAYG images is supported and can be done without additional prerequisites.


BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) Images::
Registering BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the registration process with {productname} to ensure a smooth and error-free connection.

* If you have SCC credentials ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images.

**Do not** register PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center.
Only BYOS instances should be registered against the SUSE Customer Center.

**Registering PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved**.  PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update server when added to your cloud service provider {productname} instance.

== Starting up additional {payg} {suse} products in {azure}

For more information on using {suse} {payg} products such as {sle} in the public cloud see: link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/cha-intro.html[SUSE Linux Enterprise Public Cloud Guide]


== Establishing a {payg} {sle} connection with {productname} {payg}

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to recognize that there is a difference between **{payglongform} connections** and **bootstrapping**. Bootstrapping is also known as **client registration**.

Once you have started up your {productname} {payg} instance and refreshed products you can add **{payglongform} connections** via the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go] btn:[+Add Pay-as-you-go] button. This action links your {productname} {payg} instance with additional {payg} products on {azure}. 

**Bootstrapping** or **client registration** is the process of onboarding clients in {productname}. The registration process installs the appropriate client tools and provides full management functionality.

To manage your clients, start by **establishing connections** and then proceed to **bootstrap** your clients. These two actions are the steps required for initiating and completing the client onboarding process.

.Procedure: Connecting {sle} {payg} instances to {productname} {payg}

. Return to the SUSE Manager Server WebUI.

. Navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go] and click the btn:[+Add Pay-as-you-go] button.

. Add a description.

. Complete the instance SSH connection data:
  * Host: `CSP URL of the machine`
  * SSH Port: `22`
  * User: `root`
  * Password: `<password>`
  * SSH Private Key

. Click btn:[Create] and wait for the sync to finish.

. Proceed to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Products] to access your {payg} SUSE Linux Enterprise products.

== Registering Clients

Now that you have established connections to the {productname} {payg} instance you can register them as clients. To learn how to register various clients see: xref:client-configuration:registration-methods.adoc[Client Registration Methods]

=== Minion Timeouts

Inbound and outbound connections to {azure} are released after 4 minutes of being idle. 
This affects minion connectivity, especially when your {productname} server is in {azure} and you have some on-premises minions. 
If a connection is idle for more than 4 minutes, connectivity is lost.

To resolve this issue on your minions: 

.Procedure:
. Create a new configuration file at i.a. [path]`/etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/keepalive.conf` and enable [literal]`keepalive`:
+
----
tcp_keepalive: True
tcp_keepalive_intvl: 5
tcp_keepalive_idle: 10
tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3
----

. Restart the [literal]`venv-salt-minion service`.
