= {payg} Client connections and Client Registration

== Managing connections and registering PAYG and BYOS images

PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Images::
Connecting and registering PAYG images is supported and can be done without additional prerequisites.


BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) Images::
Registering BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the registration process with {productname} to ensure a smooth and error-free connection.

* If you have SCC credentials ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images.

**Do not** register PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center.
Only BYOS instances should be registered against the SUSE Customer Center.

**Registering PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved**.  PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update server when added to your cloud service provider {productname} instance.

== Starting up additional {payg} {suse} products in {azure}

For more information on using {suse} {payg} products such as {sle} in the public cloud see: link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/cha-intro.html[SUSE Linux Enterprise Public Cloud Guide]


== Establishing a {payg} {sle} connection with {productname} {payg}

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to recognize that there is a difference between **{payglongform} connections** and **bootstrapping**. Bootstrapping is also known as **client registration**.

Once you have started up your {productname} {payg} instance and refreshed products you can add **{payglongform} connections** via the menu:Admin[Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go] btn:[+Add Pay-as-you-go] button. This action links your {productname} {payg} instance with additional {payg} products on {azure}. 

**Bootstrapping** or **client registration** is the process of onboarding clients in {productname}. The registration process installs the appropriate client tools and provides full management functionality.

To manage your clients, start by **establishing connections** and then proceed to **bootstrap** your clients. These two actions are the steps required for initiating and completing the client onboarding process.
