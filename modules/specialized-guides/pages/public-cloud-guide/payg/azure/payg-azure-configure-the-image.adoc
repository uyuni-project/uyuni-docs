= Initial Preparation and Configuration of the {azure} Image

This section covers initial preparation and configuration of the image on {azure}.

== Configuring your {productname} instance

There are two tabs you need to fill out: _Basics_ and _Virtual Machine Settings_.

=== Fill Out the _Basics_ Tab

.. Project Details
    ... As with every resource in Azure, you need to provide a _Resource Group_ (RG). This can be an existing RG or you can create a new RG for this deployment.

.. Instance Details
    ... Region – where the instance should run.
    ... Virtual Machine Name – the name of the VM in which {productname} will run.
    ... Username – the administrator account for the {productname} VM.
    ... SSH Key Source and Key – needed to access the machine.

+
[NOTE]
====
We do not allow the use of a password here. This is to reduce the risk of brute force attacks.
====

.. Managed Application Details
    ... Application Name – the name of the Managed Application.
    ... Managed Resource Group (MRG) – where the {productname} VM and its resources will be deployed into.

=== Switch to the _Virtual Machine Settings_ Tab

.. Instance Size
    ... The default for the instance size is _D8as v5_, which is a good baseline for a production server. It provides enough resources for more data disks and IOPS throughput for disk and network. 
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dasv5-dadsv5-series

+

[NOTE]
====
If you only need a test instance, you can go smaller and choose an instance size with 4 vCPUs and 16GB memory or use a _B-Series (Burstable)_ instance with a similar configuration.
====

+

.. Diagnostic Storage Account
... If you normally create a VM in the Azure portal, boot diagnostics are enabled by default using a managed storage account. You can choose an existing storage account or create a new one (default).

.. OS Disk Size
... This is the root disk of the {productname} installation, which holds:
.... The OS and the {productname} application.
.... [path]``/var/cache`` – where you need to provide storage space for each product you want to manage.
    
+

The proposed default of 100GB should be accepted.

.. Database Disk Size
... This holds the Database for {productname} and needs a minimum of 50GB. The proposed value of 80GB is a good default suggestion.

.. Spacewalk Disk Size
... This holds the package repositories and should have at least 100GB. Additional requirements include:
.... 50GB for every SUSE product.
.... >360GB for every RedHat or other Linux product.
    
+

The proposed default of 500GB is a safe default to start with.

+

[NOTE]
====
Repository synchronization will fail if this directory runs out of disk space.
====
+

.. Public IP Address for the VM
... By default, a Public IP Address is created to access the {productname} VM and Application. 
.... *If you use it, please ensure this is secure and access is limited.*

+

[IMPORTANT]
====
Running {productname} on the public cloud means implementing robust security measures. It is essential to limit, filter, monitor, and audit access to the instance. SUSE strongly advises against a globally accessible {productname} instance that lacks adequate perimeter security.
====

+

You should carefully consider this, as the {productname} Server will have access to all managed nodes. If someone gains access to {productname}, it would mean access to all managed nodes as well. Threat actors actively scan for accessible machines with open management ports (e.g., SSH or RDP), especially on cloud providers.

+

A Network Security Group (NSG) is created by default if you choose to create a Public IP. It only allows inbound SSH access via port 22 as a minimal protection for the public IP.

+

It is recommended to additionally restrict access to a defined list of networks and allow Azure's virtual network to drop requests originating from other networks.

+

Furthermore, you can add Just-in-Time access and/or use the Azure Bastion Service, Firewall, VPN, or private network methods to secure public access.

+

You can choose not to create a Public IP address (which is more secure), but you will need to use other methods to access the created {productname} VM and its Web UI for further configuration. Additionally, you must take care of the DNS and ensure a correct FQDN.

.. DNS Prefix for the Public IP Address   

... The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly. If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause issues in several {productname} components.

... To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server. You also need to ensure that *reverse lookups* are correctly configured.

+

If you use the Public IP address, a DNS name is automatically created from Azure. You only need to ensure that a unique name is used. The default suggestion creates one by including a random number to make the domain name unique.

+

If you do not use the Public IP, you need to make sure that your setup can resolve the FQDN correctly as mentioned above.

.. Virtual Network / Subnet

... You will see a default proposal for a virtual network where {productname} will reside. By clicking _edit_, you can adjust it to your needs.

... Remember that a _Managed Application_ will be deployed from SUSE to your Azure tenant. Therefore, this network is the network in the _Managed Resource Group (MRG)_ and cannot overlap with existing networks.

+

At a later stage, you need to peer this network to the network with the nodes you want to manage. Alternatively, you can create the managed nodes within this network.

+

With all fields filled out, press _Next_ or _Create_. The Azure portal will perform a final check and provide a summary screen of this deployment.

+

If everything is correct, press _Create_ to deploy the _Managed Application_ for {productname}.

=== After Deployment

After the VM is deployed, you can access it via SSH.

.Usage and Costs
[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that since this is a {payg} image, you will be billed according to your actual usage, including the number of systems you **manage** and **monitor** with this instance. It's essential to regularly track and review your usage to prevent unexpected costs and ensure alignment with your needs.
