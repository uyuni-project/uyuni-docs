= Initial Preparation and Configuration of the {azure} Managed Application
This section covers initial preparation and configuration of the Managed Application on {azure}.

.Procedure: Configuring your {productname} instance

There are two tabs you need to fill _Basic_ and _Virtual Machine Settings_

. Fill out the _Basic_ tab

+

.. Project details

... As with every resource in Azure you need to provide a _Resource Group_ (RG). This can be an existing RG or you can create a new RG for this deployment.

.. Do similar with the section _Instance Details_:

... Region, where the instance should run.

... Virtual machine name, is the name of the VM in which {productname} will run

... Username, is the administrator account for the {productname} VM

... SSH key source and key, are needed to access the machine.

+

We do not allow to use a password here. This is to reduce the risk of brute force attacks.

.. Next is the section _Managed Application Details_

... Application name is the name of the Managed Application

... Managed Resource Group (MRG) where {productname} VM and its resources will be deployed into.

+

. Switch to the Tab _Virtual Machine Settings_

+

.. The default for the instance size is a D8as v5, which is a good baseline for a production server. It provides enough resources for more data disks and IOPS throughput for disk and network https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dasv5-dadsv5-series.

+

If you only need a test instance you can go smaller and choose a instance size with 4 vcpus and 16GB Memory or use maybe a B-Series ( **B**urstable) instance with similar as above configuration.

+

.. The diagnostic storage account

+

If you normally create a VM in the Azure portal, a boot diagnostics is enabled by default. This uses a managed storage account, which get set up here. You are able to choose an existing storage account or create a new one (default).

.. OS Disk Size

+

This is the root disk of the {productname} installation, which holds the OS and the {productname} Application. In addition it holds [path]``/var/cache`` where you need to provide storage space for each product you want to manage (see {productname} Documentation - General Requirements - Hardware Requirements).
The proposed default of 100GB should be accepted.

.. Database Disk Size

+

This holds the Database for {productname} and needs a minimum of 50GB. The proposed value of 80GB is a good default suggestion.

.. Storage Disk Size

+

This holds the package repositories and should have at least 100GB. There need to be 50GB for every SUSE product and >360GB for every RedHat or other Linux product. The proposed default of 500GB is a save default to start with.

[NOTE]
====
Repository synchronization will fail, if this directory runs out of disk space.
====

.. Public IP Address for the VM

+

- As default a Public IP Address is created to access the {productname} VM and Application. *If you use it, please ensure this is secure and access is limited*.

+

[CAUTION]
====
Running {productname} on the public cloud means implementing robust security measures. It is essential to limit, filter, monitor, and audit access to the instance. SUSE strongly advises against a globally accessible {productname} instance that lacks adequate perimeter security.
====

+

You should really think twice about it, as the {productname} Server has, later on, access to all managed nodes and if someone get access to {productname} it would mean access to all managed nodes too. Threat actors actively hunt accessible machines with open management ports ( typical SSH or RDP ) especial at cloud providers.

+

A Network Security Group (NSG) is created by default if you choose to create a Public IP. It only allows inbound ssh access via port 22, as a minimal protection of the public IP.

+

You should additional restrict access to a defined list of networks and let the virtual network that Azure provides drop any requests that originate from other networks.

+

Furthermore, you also can add Just-in-time access and/or use the Azure Bastion Service and/or Firewall and/or limit address space other methods like VPN, private network to secure this public access.

+

- You can choose to not create a public IP address ( which is more secure ) but you need to use other methods to access the created {productname} VM and its Web UI to perform further configuration. Additional you need to take care of the DNS and a correct FQDN.

.. DNS Prefix for the public IP Address

The {productname} server must resolve its FQDN correctly. If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause issues in several {productname} components. To ensure that the {productname} domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server. You also need to ensure that *reverse lookups* are correctly configured.

+

If you use the Public IP address, a DNS name is automatically created from Azure. You only need to make sure that a unique name is used. The default suggestion creates one by including a random number to make the domain name unique.

+

If you do not use the public IP, you need to make sure that your setup can resolve the FQDN correctly as mentioned above.

.. Virtual Network / Subnet

You see a default proposal for a virtual network where {productname} will reside. By click _edit_ you can also change it to your needs.

+

Remember that a _Managed Application_ will be deployed from SUSE to your Azure tenant, so this network is the network in the _Managed Resource Group (MRG)_ and can not be something already used.
At a later stage, you need to peer this network to the network with the nodes you want to manage.
Alternatively you can create the managed nodes in this network.

+

With all field filled out press _next_ or _Create_. The Azure portal perform a final check and provide you with a summary screen of this deployment.

+

If everything is OK, you can press _Create_ and the _Managed Application_ {productname} gets deployed.

. After the VM is deployed, you can access it via SSH.

.Usage and Costs
[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that since this is a {payg} image, you will be billed according to your actual usage, including the number of systems you **manage** and **monitor** with this instance. It's essential to regularly track and review your usage to prevent unexpected costs and ensure alignment with your needs.
