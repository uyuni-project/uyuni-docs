= Initial Preparation and Configuration of the {azure} Image
This section covers initial preparation and configuration of the image on {azure}.

.Procedure: Configuring your {productname} instance

. Start by logging into your Azure account at Azure Portal.

. In the Azure Portal, find the menu:[Virtual Machines] section. This can be done either through the **dashboard** or by using the **search bar**.

. Select menu:[Create a resource] in the top left corner of the portal.

. Choose menu:[Compute] and then select menu:[Virtual Machine].

. You will be guided through the **Create a virtual machine** process.

. Fill in the required details such as subscription, resource group, and VM name.

. Choose a region for your VM. Ensure it complies with any geo-fencing policies you might have.

. In the **Image** dropdown, select the **manager-server-4-3-ltd** or the **manager-server-4-3-llc** image for your VM. If the image is not listed, select **Browse all public and private images** to find the required image.
 
 . Suggested sizes are selected by default for this VM. Configure optional features such as virtual CPUs, memory as required.

. Set up an administrator account for the VM. For {sles}, this can be a username and SSH public key.

. Ensure the VM is connected to the appropriate virtual network (VNet) and subnet, especially if it needs to communicate with other specific services like {productname}.
For network requirements, see xref:specialized-guides:public-cloud-guide/payg/azure/payg-azure-server-setup.adoc[Azure Server Setup: Network Configuration].

. Configure additional settings such as storage, monitoring, or any extensions you may need. The following partitions are created by default when initializing the {azure} image:

* **200 GB** for the root partition
 
* **500 GB** for spacewalk storage
 
* **80 GB** for the database. 

. Once all configurations are set, review the settings.

. Click "Create" to deploy your VM.

. After the VM is deployed, you can access it via SSH.

[NOTE] 
.Usage and Costs
====
Keep in mind that since this is a {payg} image, you will be billed according to your actual usage, including the number of systems you **manage** and **monitor** with this instance. It's essential to regularly track and review your usage to prevent unexpected costs and ensure alignment with your needs.
