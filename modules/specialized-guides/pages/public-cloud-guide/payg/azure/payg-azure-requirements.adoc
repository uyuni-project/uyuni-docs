= Azure System Requirements
The {productname} {payg} offering in Azure need to communicate with the Azure Billing API, therefore it is not a simple virtual machine (VM) offering.

Azure has created the Managed Application offering for this use case.
see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview

== Application resource group

This resource group ( in the diagram _ResGroup A_ ) holds the managed application instance, which could be translated as the metadata or definition of the offering. It can only contain a single resource.

A customer has full access to the resource group and uses it to manage the life cycle of the managed application.

== Managed resource group (MRG)

This resource group ( in the diagram _MRG_ ) holds all the resources that are required by the managed application. For example, an application's virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks.

A _managed application_ is similar to a solution template in Azure Marketplace, with a few key differences:

- The resources are deployed into a _managed resource group_ that is normally managed by the application's publisher.

- It is present in the customer's subscription, but an identity in the publisher's tenant can be given access to the managed resource group.

- The publisher's _management access_ and the customers _deny assignment_ are optional.

There are different permission scenarios available. SUSE is using here the _Customer managed_ to give our customers of SUSE Manager full control.

Customer managed::
* Customer
** Customer has full access to the solution (in the managed resource group)
** The customer manages the solution
* Publisher
** The publisher has no access to manage the solution.
** The publisher develops the application and publishes on Azure Marketplace but does not manage the application.
** The publisher licenses the application for billing through Azure Marketplace.

== Instance requirements
When setting up a {productname} {payg} instance on {azure}, it's essential to consider system requirements for optimal performance and functionality. The default requirements outlined below have been tailored for smooth deployment and operation.

By default, certain disks are automatically generated when establishing a {productname} {payg} instance on {azure}. To complete the setup of these disks, use the **mgr-storage-server** tool.
