= Channels

{productname} manages both central and local configuration channels and files.
Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems, and is available for both traditional and salt clients.
For traditional clients, use local configuration management.
For salt clients, use state channels.
For traditional clients, local configuration management is also available.
Local configuration management allows you to specify overrides, and select configuration files that are not changed when the system is subscribed to a central channel.

A state channel is a type of a configuration channel used only for Salt clients.
In state channels, the [path]``init.sls`` file is not automatically generated, you must manually create and edit it.
State channels can contain arbitrary configuration files that you can reference from within the [path]``init.sls`` file.

[NOTE]
====
You must reference configuration files with the `salt://` prefix, the organization ID, and the channel name.
For example, to reference [path]``/etc/motd`` use:

----
file.managed:
  - source: salt://manager_org_1/<channel_name>/etc/motd
----
====


Central configuration or state channels must be created via the links on this page.

Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel.
If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the [guimenu]``List/Remove Files`` page of that channel.
If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the menu:Configuration Channel Details[Systems > Subscribed   Systems] page for that channel.

Add Files::
The [guimenu]``Add Files`` page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to [guimenu]``Upload``, [guimenu]``Import``, or [guimenu]``Create`` configuration files to be included in the channel.

Upload File:::
To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the btn:[Upload Configuration File] button.
The [guimenu]``Filename/Path`` field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed.
+
You can set the [guimenu]``Ownership`` via the [guimenu]``user name`` and [guimenu]``group name`` and the [guimenu]``Permissions`` of the file when it is deployed.
+
If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
+
If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
For more information on using macros, see xref:reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros[].

Then click btn:[Import Configuration File(s)].
+

NOTE: A sandbox icon (image:spacewalk-icon-sandbox.svg[Spacewalk Icon Sandbox,scaledwidth=0.9em]) indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox.
Files in a system's sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable.
Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel.
