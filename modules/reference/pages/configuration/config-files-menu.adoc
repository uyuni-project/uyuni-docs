This page allows you to manage your configuration files independently.
Both centrally managed and locally managed files can be reached from sub-pages.


[NOTE]
====
By default, the maximum file size for configuration files is 128 KB (131072 bytes).
{suse} supports a configuration file size up to 1 MB.
Larger files are not guaranteed to work.

ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2010-12-21 - ke: will "rhn" stay here? 2010-12-28 - kkaempf: "rhn" will
    stay here. #
endif::showremarks[]

The default maximum file size is set on the {productname} Server in these files:

----
# /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_web.conf
web.maximum_config_file_size = 131072

# /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_server.conf
maximum_config_file_size = 131072
----

Copy these variables to [filename]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` and edit them.
Values are specified in bytes, for example:

----
# /etc/rhn/rhn.conf
web.maximum_config_file_size = 262144
server.maximum_config_file_size = 262144
----


Then restart [systemitem]``spacewalk``:

----
spacewalk-service restart
----
