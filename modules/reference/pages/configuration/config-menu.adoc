The [guimenu]``Configuration`` section provides access to features for managing the configuration of {productname} clients.

[NOTE]
====
The [guimenu]``Configuration`` menu is only available if you are signed in with a configuration administrator or {productname} administrator account.
====

Within the configuration pages, you can manage clients using configuration files, and configure channels offering configuration files, and configuration files themselves.
Centrally managed files are available to multiple clients, while locally managed files are available to individual clients only.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration Management is available for both traditional and Salt clients.
Some traditional features are not suitable for Salt clients, and thus not available for Salt clients and excluded from the {webui}.
