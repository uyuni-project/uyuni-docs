= Configuration Menu

The [guimenu]``Configuration`` section provides access to features for managing the configuration of {productname} clients.

[NOTE]
====
The [guimenu]``Configuration`` menu is only available if you are signed in with a configuration administrator or {productname} administrator account.
====

Within the configuration pages, you can manage clients using configuration files, and configure channels offering configuration files, and configuration files themselves.
Centrally-managed files are available to multiple clients, while locally-managed files are available to individual clients only.

[NOTE]
====
Configuration Management is available for both traditional and Salt clients.
Some traditional features are not suitable for Salt clients, and thus not available for Salt clients and excluded from the {webui}.
