= Centrally Managed Configuration Files

Centrally-managed files are available to multiple systems.
Changing a file within a centrally-managed channel may result in changes to several systems.
Locally-managed files supersede centrally-managed files.
For more information about locally-managed files, see
xref:reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc[Locally Managed Configuration Files].

This page lists all files currently stored in your central configuration channel.
