= Centrally Managed Configuration Files

{localesdir} 


Centrally managed files are available to multiple systems.
Changing a file within a centrally managed channel may result in changes to several systems.
Locally managed files supersede centrally managed files.
For more information about locally managed files, see
xref:reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc[Locally Managed Configuration Files].

This page lists all files currently stored in your central configuration channel.
