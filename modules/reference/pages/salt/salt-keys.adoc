The menu:Salt[Keys] section displays the key fingerprints of your current Salt clients.

Key fingerprints are exchanged between the {productname} Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client.
This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server.

Click btn:[Refresh] to update the list.
Click the name of a client to go to menu:Systems[Details] for that client.
