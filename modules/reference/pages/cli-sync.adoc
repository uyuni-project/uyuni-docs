= Synchronization CLI Tools

There are two tools for synchronizing clients to the server.
For clients that are connected to the {scc}, use ``mgr-sync``.
For all other clients, use ``spacewalk-repo-sync``.



== Synchronize SCC Repositories With mgr-sync

//This content is the same as the content at modules/administration/pages/mgr-sync.adoc Perhaps we should snippet it? --LKB 2020-10-09

The primary use of ``mgr-sync`` is to connect to the {scc}, retrieve product and package information, and prepare channels for synchronization with the {productname} Server.

This tool is designed for use with a {suse} support subscription.
It is not required for open source distributions, including {opensuse}, {centos}, and {ubuntu}.

The available commands and arguments for ``mgr-sync`` are listed in this table.
Use this syntax for ``mgr-sync`` commands:

----
mgr-sync [-h] [--version] [-v] [-s] [-d {1,2,3}] {list,add,refresh,delete}
----

.mgr-sync Commands
|===
| Command | Description | Example Use
| list | List channels, organization credentials, or products | ``mgr-sync list channels``
| add | Add channels, organization credentials, or products | ``mgr-sync add channel <channel_name>``
| refresh | Refresh the local copy of products, channels, and subscriptions | ``mgr-sync refresh``
| delete | Delete existing SCC organization credentials from the local system | ``mgr-sync delete credentials``
| sync | Synchronize specified channel or ask for it when left blank| ``mgr-sync sync channel <channel_name>``

.mgr-sync Optional Arguments
|===
| Option | Abbreviated option | Description | Example Use
| help | ``h`` | Display the command usage and options | ``mgr-sync --help``
| version | N/A | Display the currently installed version of ``mgr-sync`` | ``mgr-sync --version``
| verbose | ``v`` | Provide verbose output | ``mgr-sync --verbose refresh``
| store-credentials | ``s`` | Store credentials a local hidden file | ``mgr-sync --store-credentials``
| debug | ``d`` | Log additional debugging information. Requires a level of 1, 2, 3. 3 provides the highest amnount of debugging information | ``mgr-sync -d 3 refresh``
| no-sync | N/A | Use with the ``add`` command to add products or channels without beginning a synchronization | ``mgr-sync --no-sync add <channel_name>``

Logs for ``mgr-sync`` are located in:

== Synchronize Repositories with spacewalk-repo-sync

The [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` tool synchronizes software repositories into {productname} channels.
In most cases, this happens automatically, but you can use the tool to run it manually if required.

The [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` tool has these primary commands:

[[spacewalk-repo-sync-options]]
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
.spacewalk-repo-sync Options
|===

| Option
| Description
| Example Use

| list
| List all custom channels and the repositories assigned to them.
| ``spacewalk-repo-sync --list``

| channel
| Synchronize a single channel to all repositories assigned to it.
| ``spacewalk-repo-sync  --channel <custom-channel>``

| deep-verify
| ignore cached package checksums.
| ``spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify``

| force-all-errata
| force re-importing all the patches.
| ``spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify``

| no-packages
| excludes packages from the operation.
| ``spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify --no-packages``

For a complete list of options, see the ``spacewalk-repo-sync`` manpage:

----
man spacewalk-repo-sync

== Troubleshooting Synchronization

If you are having trouble synchronizing with ``spacewalk-repo-sync`` you can find out more by watching the HTTP log as the command runs.



.Procedure: Troubleshooting Synchronization Problems
. Log the HTTP output into [path]``/var/log/zypper.log``:
+
----
ZYPP_MEDIA_CURL_DEBUG=2 spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label>
----
. Export the setting:
+
----
export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG
----
. Start the synchronization:
+
----
/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label> --type yum
----
  You can increase the debug level, by adding the [option]``-vvv`` option to the command.
. When the complete completes, or fails, disable debug mode:
+
----
unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG
----



=== Add Custom Extra HTTP Headers

You can add custom HTTP headers to the requests made by [command]``spacewalk-repo-sync`` at the time of synchronization.
The custom HTTP headers are defined in the [path]``/etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf`` configuration file.
The headers can be defined by repository name or channel label.
You can also define global headers by putting them in the ``main`` section.
For example:

----
[testchannel]
X-MY-HEADER-1=VALUE
X-MY-HEADER-2=VALUE

[mychannel]
X-MY-HEADER-3=VALUE
X-MY-HEADER-4=VALUE

[main]
X-MYGLOBAL-HEADER=VALUE
----

This can be particularly useful when dealing with Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repositories in the public cloud.
