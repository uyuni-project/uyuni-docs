To clone an existing channel, click the [guimenu]``Clone Channel`` link.
Select the channel to be cloned from the drop-down box, select whether to clone the current state (including patches) or the original state (without patches).
You can also select specific patches to use for cloning.
Then click the btn:[Create Channel] button.
In the next screen select options for the new channel, including base architecture and GPG, then click [guimenu]``Create Channel``.

The GPG key URL may be either an internal file location such as `file:///` or you may use an external URL.

To create a new channel, click the [guimenu]``Create Channel`` link.
Select the appropriate options for the new channel, including base architecture and GPG options, then click btn:[Create Channel].
Note that a channel created in this manner is blank, containing no packages.
You must either upload software packages or add packages from other repositories.
You may also choose to include patches in your custom channel.

`Enable GPG Check` is automatically selected when creating a new channel.
If you would like to add custom packages and applications to your channel, make sure you deselect this box or you cannot install/add unsigned packages.
Keep in mind this is a security risk for packages from an untrusted source.
