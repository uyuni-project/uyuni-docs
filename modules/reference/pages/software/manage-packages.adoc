The menu:Software[Manage > Packages] section allows you to manage packages that are owned by your organization.

Select a channel from the drop-down box to see all packages related to that channel.
If you have administration privileges within your organization, you can also delete packages.

* Orphaned packages are packages that are synchronized by {productname}, but not associated with a software channel.
  For handling those packages, see xref:client-configuration:package-management.adoc#package-management-orphaned-packages[].
* For more information about custom channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].
