== Channels Overview

The menu:Main Menu[Software > Channels] menu item is the first to appear.
A software channel provides packages grouped by products or applications to simplify the selection of packages to be installed on a system.

There are two types of software channels: base channels and child channels.

[[s3-sm-channel-list-base]]
Base Channels::
A base channel consists of packages built for a specific architecture and release.
For example, all of the packages in {sles}{nbsp}12 for the `x86_64` architecture make up a base channel.
The list of packages in {sles}{nbsp}12 for the `s390x` architecture make up a different base channel.
+

A system must be subscribed to only one base channel assigned automatically during registration based on the {sle} release and system architecture.
For paid base channels, an associated subscription must exist.
+

[[sm-channel-list-child]]
Child Channels::
A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides extra packages.
For example, an organization can create a child channel associated with {sles} on `x86_64` architecture that contains extra packages for a custom application.
+

Especially important are the {productname} Tools channels that are available for every base channel.
These tools channels provide the tools needed to connect the clients with the {productname} server.
+

A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel.
Only packages provided by a subscribed channel can be installed or updated.
{productname} Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority.
This authority gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels.
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system.
