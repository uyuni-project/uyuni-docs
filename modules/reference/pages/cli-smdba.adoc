= Database CLIÂ Tool

The ``smdba`` tool allows you to manage the installed PostgreSQL database.
It allows you to backup and restore the database, as well as administration tasks like creating, verifying, and restarting the database.
The tool works on local databases only.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The ``smdba`` tool replaces the older ``db-control`` tool.
The ``db-control`` tool is now unsupported.
====

After you stop or restart the database, you need to restart the {productname} services.
