== Configure the HTTP Proxy

{productname} can connect to the {scc} (SCC) or other remote servers using a proxy.
Navigate to the [guimenu]``HTTP Proxy`` tab to configure the proxy.

You will need to provide the hostname of the proxy.
Use the syntax ``<hostname>:<port>``.
For example: ``<example.com>:8080``.

You can disable use of the proxy by clearing the fields.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When choosing a username or password for your {productname} Proxy, ensure it does not contain an ``@`` or ``:`` character.
These characters are reserved.
