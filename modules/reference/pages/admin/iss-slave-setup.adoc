= ISS Slave Setup

The menu:Admin[ISSÂ Configuration > Slave Setup] section is used to configure an inter-server synchronization (ISS) slave.

If you are logged in to an ISS slave, this page lists all masters that the slave has previously synchronized with.

To add a new master, click btn:[Add new master].
You will need the master's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), and the full path to the CA Certificate.
For example:
----
/etc/pki/trust/anchors
----

For more information about ISS, see xref:administration:iss.adoc[].
