The menu:Admin[ISS Configuration > Master Setup] section is used to configure an inter-server synchronization (ISS) master.

If you are logged in to an ISS master, this page lists all slaves that can receive content from this master.

To add new slaves to the master, click btn:[Add new slave].
You will need the slave's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

Check the [guimenu]``Allow Slave to Sync?`` checkbox to enable the slave to synchronize with the master.

Check the [guimenu]``Sync All Orgs to Slave?`` checkbox to synchronize all organizations to this slave.

For more information about ISS, see xref:administration:iss.adoc[].
