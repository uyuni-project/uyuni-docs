The menu:Admin[Task Schedules] section lists all predefined task bunches.
Tasks can be grouped together in bunches to simplify managing them.

This page shows the schedule for each bunch of tasks.
Every schedule shows how frequently it runs using ``cron`` notation, the time it became active, and the bunch that it belongs to.

Click a schedule to change its frequency, disable or activate it.

[WARNING]
====
Do not disable a schedule if you are not certain what it does.
