[[ref-admin-users]]
= Users

The menu:Admin[Users] section allows you to view and manage all users of the organization you are logged in to.
Every user shows the username, real name, the organization they are associated with, and whether the user is an organization or {productname} administrator.

You can also change a user's {productname} or Organization Administrator role on this page by checking or unchecking [guimenu]``{productname} Admin?`` or [guimenu]``{Org Admin}?`` as required.

Click a username to modify the user account details, and change other administrator roles.

For more information, see xref:reference:users/user-details.adoc[].
