The menu:Admin[ISS Configuration] section is used to configure inter-server synchronization (ISS).
ISS allows you to connect two or more {productname} Servers and keep them up-to-date.

To set up ISS, you need to define one {productname} Server as a master, with the other as a slave.
If conflicting configurations exist, the system will prioritize the master configuration.

For more information about ISS, see xref:administration:iss.adoc[].
