[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not disable SSL in your bootstrap script.
Ensure that [guimenu]``Enable SSL`` is checked in the {webui}, or that the setting `USING_SSL=1` exists in the bootstrap script.
If you disable SSL, the registration process requires custom SSL certificates.
For more about custom certificates, see xref:administration:ssl-certs.adoc[].
