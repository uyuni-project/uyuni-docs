The menu:Patches[Manage Patches] section shows you all custom patches.

Each patch in the list shows a patch type, an advisory name, a short description, and the date the patch was last updated.
Click the advisory name to go to menu:Patches[Patch List > Patch Details] for the patch.

To create a new patch, click btn:[Create Patch].
To delete a patch, select it in the list, and click btn:[Delete Patches].

[WARNING]
====
If you use {productname} with a proxy, manage patches only on the {productname} Server.

If you manage patches on a proxy, the servers will be unable to synchronize correctly.
