= Clone Patches

The menu:Patches[Clone Patches] section allows you to create copies of existing patches to distribute to your clients.

To clone a patch, the patch must apply to one of your existing software channels.
If the patch was part of a software channel that was cloned, then you can clone the patch from the cloned channel.

See all patches that are available for cloning by selecting the channel name in the [guimenu]``View patches potentially applicable to:`` field, and click btn:[View].
From the list, check the patch to clone, and click btn:[Clone Patch].
You need to confirm the details to perform the clone.
