= Command Line Tools

There are several command line tools available in {productname}.
Every action that can be completed using the {webui} can be performed at a command prompt instead.
Additionally, there are some actions that can only be performed at the command prompt.

Manage configuration with:

* ``mgrcfg-manager``
* ``mgrcfg-client``
* ``mgr-actions-control``

Manage package and channel synchronization with:

* ``spacewalk-repo-sync``
* ``mgr-sync``

Manage bootstrapping with:

* ``mgr-create-bootstrap-repo``

Manage the database with:

* ``smdba``


Some of these command line tools are installed by default.
To install a command line tool, you can use the {productname} {webui}, or use your package manager at the command prompt.
