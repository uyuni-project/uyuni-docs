== Overview Conventions

The menu:Main Menu[Systems > Overview] page displays a list of all your registered systems.
Several columns provide information about each system:

Select box::
Systems without a system type cannot be selected. To select systems, mark the appropriate check boxes.
Selected systems are added to the *System Set Manager*, where actions can be carried out simultaneously on all systems in the set.
For more information, see xref:reference:systems/ssm-overview.adoc[].
+

System::
The name of the system specified during registration.
The default name is the host name of the system.
Clicking the name of a system displays its [guimenu]``System Details`` page.
For more information, see xref:reference:systems/system-details.adoc[].
+

* image:spacewalk-icon-virtual-host.svg[Virtual Host,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- Virtual Host.
* image:spacewalk-icon-virtual-guest.svg[Virtual Guest,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- Virtual Guest.

Some icons are linked to related tasks.
For example, the standard Updates icon is linked to the [guimenu]``Upgrade`` subtab of the packages list, while the Critical Updates icon links directly to the [guimenu]``Software Patches`` page.
+

* image:fa-check-circle.svg[Check Circle,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- System is up-to-date.
* image:fa-exclamation-circle.svg[Exclamation Circle,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Critical patch (errata) available, update _strongly_ recommended.
* image:fa-warning.svg[Warning,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Updates available and recommended.
* image:fa-question-circle.svg[Question,scaledwidth=1.8em] -- System not checking in properly (for 24 hours or more).

+

Patches::
Total number of patch alerts applicable to the system.
+

Packages:: Total number of package updates for the system, including packages related to patch alerts and newer versions of packages not related to patch alerts.
For example, if a client system that has an earlier version of a package installed gets subscribed to the appropriate base channel (such as {sle}Â 12 SP2), that channel may have an updated version of the package.
If so, the package appears in the list of available package updates.
+

[IMPORTANT]
.Package Conflict
====
If {productname} identifies package updates for the system, but the package updater (such as Red Hat Update Agent or {yast}) responds with a message such as "Your system is fully updated", a conflict likely exists in the system's package profile or in the [path]``up2date`` configuration file.
To resolve the conflict, either schedule a package list update or remove the packages from the package exceptions list.
For more information, see xref:reference:systems/system-details/sd-details.adoc[].
====
+

Configs::
Total number of configuration files applicable to the system.
+

Base Channel::
The primary channel for the system based on its operating system.
For more information, see xref:reference:software/channel-details.adoc[].
+

System Type::
Shows whether the system is managed and at what service level.

Links in the navigation bar below menu:Main Menu[Systems] enable you to select and view predefined sets of your systems.
All of the options described above can be applied within these pages.
