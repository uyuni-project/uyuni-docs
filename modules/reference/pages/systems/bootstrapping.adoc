// I've added these new bits in the existing format for now, but this whole section will get overhauled with the Ref Guide updates. LKB --2020-04-17
Authentication Method::
Select either ``Password`` or ``SSH Private Key``.

Password::
For password authentication, enter the client's login password.

SSH Private Key::
For SSH key authentication, copy the SSH private key.
The key is only stored for as long as the bootstrapping process takes to complete.

SSH Private Key Passphrase::
For SSH authentication, enter the passphrase for the private key.

Activation Key::
Select the activation key (associated with a software source channel) that the client should use to bootstrap with.

Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking::
This check box is selected by default.
This allows the script to auto-accept host keys without requiring a user to manually authenticate.

Manage System Completely via SSH (Will not Install an Agent)::
If selected a system will automatically be configured to use SSH.
No other connection method will be configured.

Once your client's connection details have been filled in click the btn:[Bootstrap] button.
When the client has completed the bootstrap process, find your new client listed on the menu:Systems[Overview] page.
