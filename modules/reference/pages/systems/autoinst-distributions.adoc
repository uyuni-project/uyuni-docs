= Distributions

The [guimenu]``Distributions`` page enables you to find and create custom installation trees that may be used for automated installations.

[NOTE]
====
The [guimenu]``Distributions`` page does not display distributions already provided.
They can be found within the [guimenu]``Distribution`` drop-down menu of the [guimenu]``Autoinstallation Details`` page.

For more information about installing SUSE distributions, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/book-sle-deployment.html.

For more information about installing Red Hat distributions, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/chap-kickstart-installations.

The installation tree must be located in a local directory on the {productname} Server.



.Procedure: Creating a Distribution for Autoinstallation
. In the {productname} {webui}, navigate to menu:Systems[Autoinstallation > Distributions].
. To create a distribution, on the [guimenu]``Autoinstallable Distributions`` page click [guimenu]``Create Distribution`` in the upper right corner.
. On the [guimenu]``Create Autoinstallable Distribution`` page, provide the following data:
+
** Enter a label (without spaces) in the [guimenu]``Distribution Label`` field, such as `my-orgs-sles-15-sp1` or ``my-orgs-rhel-as-7``.
** In the [guimenu]``Tree Path`` field, paste the path to the base of the installation tree.
** Select the matching distribution from the [guimenu]``Base Channel`` and [guimenu]``Installer Generation`` drop-down menus, such as `SUSE Linux` for {sle}, or `Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7` for {rhel} 7 client systems.
. When finished, click the btn:[Create Autoinstallable Distribution] button.



[[s4-sm-system-kick-dist-variables]]
== Variables

Autoinstallation variables can be used to substitute values into Kickstart and {ay} profiles.
To define a variable, create a name-value pair ([replaceable]``name/value``) in the text box.

For example, if you want to autoinstall a system that joins the network of a specified organization (for example the Engineering department) you can create a profile variable to set the IP address and the gateway server address to a variable that any system using that profile will use.
Add the following line to the [guimenu]``Variables`` text box.

----
IPADDR=192.168.0.28
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
----


To use the distribution variable, use the name of the variable in the profile to substitute the value.
For example, the [option]``network`` part of a {kickstart} file looks like the following:

----
network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$IPADDR \
  --gateway=$GATEWAY
----


The [option]``$IPADDR`` will be resolved to ``192.168.0.28``, and the [option]``$GATEWAY`` to ``192.168.0.1``.

[NOTE]
====
There is a hierarchy when creating and using variables in Kickstart files.
System Kickstart variables take precedence over Profile variables, which in turn take precedence over Distribution variables.
Understanding this hierarchy can alleviate confusion when using variables in {kickstart}s.
====


In {ay} profiles you can use such variables as well.

Using variables are just one part of the larger Cobbler infrastructure for creating templates that can be shared between multiple profiles and systems.

For more information about Cobbler and templates, see xref:client-configuration:cobbler.adoc[].
