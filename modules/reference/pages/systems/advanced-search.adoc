The menu:Systems[Advanced Search] section allows you to perform global searches within your {productname} environment.
Searches can include network information, hardware devices, location, activity, packages, details, DMI information, and hardware.

Type your search term in the [guimenu]``Search For`` field.
Select the criterion to search by, use the radio buttons to specify whether you want to query all systems or only those in the [guimenu]``System Set Manager``, and click the btn:[Search] button.
Check [guimenu]``Invert Result`` to list only results that do not match the specified criteria.

When you add a distribution, synchronize channels, or register a client, it can take several minutes for it to be indexed and appear in search results.
To force a rebuild of the search index, use this command at the command prompt:

----
rhn-search cleanindex
