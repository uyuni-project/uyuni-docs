Beginning with SLE 12 {suse} supports service pack skipping, it is now possible to migrate from for example, SLE 12 SP2 to SLE 12 SP4.
Note that SLE 11 may only be migrated step by step and individual service packs should not be skipped.
For supported upgrade path, see the product documementation of the client system.
For example for SLES client systems, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html#sec-upgrade-paths-supported.



[WARNING]
.Migrating from an Earlier Version of SLES
====
With SP migration is not possible to migrate major versions, for example, from SLE 12 to SLE 15 using this tool.
You must use {ay} to perform an upgrade on this level.

[WARNING]
.Rollback Not Possible

The migration feature does not cover any rollback functionality.
When the migration procedure is started, rolling back is not possible.
Therefore it is recommended to have a working system backup available for an emergency.
