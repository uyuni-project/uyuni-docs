= Recurring Actions

The menu:Systems[Recurring Actions] section allows you to manage recurring actions on the selected client.
You can schedule an arbitrary set of Salt states or the highstate to be executed at desired intervals.
This is only available for Salt clients.

For more information about Salt states, see xref:specialized-guides:salt/salt-states-and-pillars.adoc[].

Currently, {productname} supports the following action types as recurring actions:

- [guimenu]``Highstate:`` Execute the highstate.
- [guimenu]``Custom state:`` Execute a set of custom states. A custom state can be either an internal state provided by {productname}, or a configuration channel created by a user.

For more information about configuration channels, see xref:client-configuration:configuration-management.adoc[].



== Creating Recurring Actions

To create new schedules, click the btn:[Create] icon on the top right corner.
Choose a supported action type, give your recurring schedule a name, select a time and day for it to recur, and click btn:[Create Schedule].
Toggle the btn:[Test mode] switch to test the highstate before you apply it.



== Recurring Action Details

View the details about an action from the action list.
In the [guimenu]``Actions`` column, click the btn:[Details] icon for the action you are interested in.



== Disabling Recurring Actions

Disabling an action stops the action recurring, but does not delete it.
To disable a recurring action toggle the [guimenu]``Active`` switch off.
Enable them again by toggling the [guimenu]``Active`` switch on.
Disabled recurring actions remain in the list, but are not executed.



== Editing Recurring Actions

In the [guimenu]``Actions`` column, click the btn:[Edit] icon for the action you want to change.
On the [guimenu]``Schedule Recurring Action`` page, the existing properties are pre-filled.
Make your changes, and click btn:[Update Schedule].



== Deleting Recurring Actions

Deleting an action permanently removes it.
To start using the action again, you will need to create a new action.
In the [guimenu]``Actions`` column, click the btn:[Delete] icon for the action you want to delete, and confirm the deletion.
