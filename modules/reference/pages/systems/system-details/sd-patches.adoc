To apply updates, select them and click the btn:[Apply Patches] button.
Double-check the updates to be applied on the confirmation page, then click the btn:[Confirm] button.

The action is added to the menu:Main Menu[Schedule > Pending Actions] list.
Patches that have been scheduled cannot be selected for update.
Instead of a check box there is a clock icon.
Click the clock to see the [guimenu]``Action Details`` page.

The [guimenu]``Status`` column in the menu:System Details[Software > Patches] table shows whether an update has been scheduled.
Possible values are:

* None
* Pending
* Picked Up
* Completed
* Failed

This column displays only the latest action related to a patch.
For example, if an action fails and you reschedule it, this column shows the status of the patch as `Pending` with no mention of the previous failure.
Clicking a status other than `None` takes you to the [guimenu]``Action Details`` page.
