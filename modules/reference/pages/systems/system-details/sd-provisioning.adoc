= Provisioning

The menu:Systems[Provisioning] section allows you to manage provisioning for the selected client.
This includes managing and scheduling autoinstallation, booting the selected client, and managing snapshots of the client configuration state.

The menu:Systems[Provisioning] tab is split into subtabs:



== Autoinstallation

This section displays a list of the available autoinstallation profiles for the selected client.
Select a time and date for autoinstallation to re-install the client.

== Power Management

This section allows you to power on, power off, and reboot the selected client.
