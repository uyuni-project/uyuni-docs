The menu:Systems[Formulas] section allows you to manage Salt formulas on the selected client.
This is only available for Salt clients.

This section lists all currently installed formulas.
Check the formulas you want to apply, and click btn:[Save].
When a formula is applied, it will create a new subtab.
Navigate to the subtab to configure the formula on the selected client.
After most formula actions, you will need to apply the highstate to pick up the changes.
