This is only available for Salt clients.

Check the formulas you want to apply, and click btn:[Save].
When a formula is applied, it will create a new subtab.
Navigate to the subtab to configure the formula on the selected client.
After most formula actions, you will need to apply the highstate to pick up the changes.
