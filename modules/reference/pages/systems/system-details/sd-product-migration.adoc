The menu:Systems[Software > Product Migration] section allows you to upgrade clients to the latest service pack of their underlying operating system.
Product migration also allows you to migrate openSUSE Leap to the corresponding SLE SP level or clients such as {rhel}, or {centos} to {sll}.
Check the product version you want to upgrade the client to, and click btn:[Select Channels].

For more information about service pack upgrades, see xref:client-configuration:client-upgrades-product-migration.adoc[].
