[[sd-virtualization]]
= SD Virtualization

This tab allows you to create new virtual guests, apply images on a
traditionally managed host system, or change the status of virtual guests.
You can also list and manage the storage pools that are used for the virtual machines.


// TODO Update the screenshot for a salt minion
image::system_details_traditional_virtualization_details.png[scaledwidth=80%]

The [guimenu]``Virtualization`` tab has one subtab, [guimenu]``Guests``.
For traditional systems that have Virtualization entitlements, you will also see two additional subtabs for [guimenu]``Provisioning``, and [guimenu]``Deployment``.
For Salt clients, you will also see a [guimenu]``Storage`` subtab.
These tabs appear only for systems having the Virtualization entitlement.
It is not possible to create a guest system that runs on another guest system.

[[sdc-guests]]
== Guests

[guimenu]``Guests`` is the default virtualization tab.
It presents a table of the host system's virtual guests.
For each guest system, the following information is provided:

[guimenu]``Status``::
This field indicates whether the virtual system is running, paused, stopped, or has crashed.

[guimenu]``Updates``::
This field indicates whether patches (errata) applicable to the guest have yet to be applied.

[guimenu]``Base Software Channel``::
This field indicates the Base Channel to which the guest is subscribed.


[NOTE]
====
If a guest system has not registered with {productname}, this information appears as plain text in the table.
====

[guimenu]``Actions``::
This field contains the possible actions for the guest.
These are depending on the virtual guest status, they may not refresh instantaneously when running a Start, Stop, Suspend, Resume action.
The btn:[Edit] button allows changing virtual guest properties, including the amount of allocated memory and virtual CPUs.

The btn:[Graphical Console] button opens the Spice or VNC display in a new tab.

If you have System Group Administrator responsibilities assigned for your guest systems, a user might see the message [guimenu]``You do not have permission to access this system`` in the table.
This is because it is possible to assign virtual guests on a single host to multiple System Group Administrators.
Only users that have System Group Administrator privileges on the host system may create new virtual guests.

For Salt systems, the btn:[Create Guest] button shows a dialog to configure and create a new virtual machine.

[[sd-editing-a-vm]]
=== Editing a Virtual Machine

[NOTE]
====
Traditional systems can only edit CPU and memory allocation.
====

The fields in this dialog are grouped into several panels.
The [guimenu]``General`` panel contains the [guimenu]``CPU`` and [guimenu]``memory`` fields.
The [guimenu]``Disks`` and [guimenu]``Network Interfaces`` panels list the fields corresponding to the matching devices of the virtal machine.
The [guimenu]``Graphics`` panel allows configuring the display of the virtual machine.
The [guimenu]``Schedule`` panel helps configuring when the edit should take place by choosing either an earliest time or an action chain to append to.

[NOTE]
====
If a guest contains one or more disks or network interfaces not recognized by {susemgr}, you will not be able to edit the configuration.
This prevents any possibility of {susemgr} destroying the setup because of an unhandled type.
====

The order of the disks is important: the disk naming will be computed from it. This means that the first virtio disk will be named 'vda', the second will be named 'vdb' and so on.

When clicking the btn:[+] in the [guimenu]``Disks`` (or [guimenu]``Network Interfaces``) panel header, a new disk (or network interface) will be appended to the list.
Likewise, clicking the btn:[-] button next to a disk or interface will remove it.
The default size for a new disk is 8[nbsp]GB.
The [guimenu]``Source image template URL`` field contains the URL to a disk image to be copied and used for the virtual machine.

Click the btn:[Update] button to apply the changes.

// TODO Add a screenshot of the edit page, maybe more

[float]
[[sd-createing-a-vm-salt]]
=== Creating a virtual machine [Salt]

To create a new virtual machine, the process is similar to editing, but there are some additional fields:

The [guimenu]``Name`` field defining the name of the virtual machine to create.
The [guimenu]``Hypervisor`` field to allow choosing among the available hypervisors of the host.
The [guimenu]``Virtual Machine Type`` to choose between fully virtualized and para-virtualized virtual machines if applicable.
The [guimenu]``Architecture`` to select the emulated CPU architecture, the default being the virtual host one.

By default a disk and a network interfaces are added. The only required value to set is the disk [guimenu]``Source template image URL`` or the virtual machine will only have an empty disk.

The new virtual machine will start immediately after it has been defined.

// TODO Add a screenshot of the create page showing the additional fields


[float]
[[sdc-virt-host-guest-graphical-console]]
===== Display a virtual machine graphical console [Salt]

The virtual machine graphical console might prompt you for a password.
This password is the Spice or VNC one.

// TODO Add a screenshot of the graphical console

For the Spice display to be adjusted to the window, the Spice VD agent needs to be installed within the virtual machine.


[[sd-virtualization-deployment-management]]
== Deployment [Management]

In the menu:System Details[Virtualization] tab of a traditionally registered bare-metal machine, there is a  menu:System Details[Virtualization > Deployment] subtab. This form expects a URL to a ``qcow2`` type of image and some other parameters allowing the user to schedule the deployment of that image.

image::system_details_traditional_virtualization_deployment.png[scaledwidth=80%]

When the deploment scheduled it is listed as an action on the menu:Main Menu[Schedule > Pending Actions].

== Storage [Salt]

The [guimenu]``Storage`` tab presents a tree list of the virtual storage pools and volumes defined on the virtual host.
The first level of the tree is the list of storage pools and all items contained in them are volumes.
By default the pools need to be expanded to show the volumes.

image::modules/reference/assets/images/system_details_salt_virtual_pools.png[scaledwidth=80%]

For each pool the following information is provided:

[guimenu]``Status``::
This field indicates whether the pool is running or stopped.

[guimenu]``Autostart``::
This field indicates whether the pool is started automatically when the virtual host boots

[guimenu]``Persistent``::
This field indicates whether the pool will be kept or not after being stopped.

[guimenu]``Location``::

Note that some pool types don't have any associated path.

[guimenu]``Usage``::
This field shows the disk usage of the pool or [guimenu]``Unknown`` if the pool is not running.

For each volume the following information is provided:

* The names of the virtual machines using the volume.
This list may not be provided depending on the pool type.

* The disk usage of the volume.

=== Refreshing a pool

[systemitem]``Libvirt`` doesn't update the pool usage and contents in real time.
In order to update the usage or to see a volume that has been created outside of {productname}, the pool needs to be refreshed.
Click the [guimenu]``Refresh`` button to schedule a refresh of the pool.

=== Creating a pool

To create a storage pool click the [guimenu]``Create Pool`` button.
This opens a new page with a form to define the pool.
It contains the following fields:

[guimenu]``name``::
The name of the pool to create.

[guimenu]``type``::
The type of the pool to create.
The list of available types depends on the virtual host setup.

[guimenu]``Earliest``::
The earliest time the pool creation action should be scheduled.

[guimenu]``Add to``::
Add the pool creation action to a new or already created action chain.

All the remaining fields are depending on the selected field type.
These fields are grouped in two panels:

* the [guimenu]``Source`` panel contains the data about the device holding the pool.
* the [guimenu]``Target`` panel contains the data about where to find the pool on the virtual host.
