= System Details

The [guimenu]``System Details`` section allows you to manage the details for a chosen client.
To get to this section, click the name of a client anywhere throughout the {webui} to see the relevant [guimenu]``System Details`` page for the client.

The [guimenu]``System Details`` section is divided into tabs and subtabs.
Each tab and subtab has its own section in this document.

The menu:Systems[Details > Overview] subtab is displayed by default.
Which tabs are available is dependent on the system type of the client you have selected.
