The [guimenu]``System Details`` section allows you to manage the details for a chosen client.
To get to this section, click the name of a client anywhere throughout the {webui} to see the relevant [guimenu]``System Details`` page for the client.

The [guimenu]``System Details`` section is divided into tabs and subtabs.
Each tab and subtab has its own section in this document.
Some of these tabs are only available when the client has that feature enabled (which often depends on a special [systemitem]``system type``):

 Details
 Software
 Configuration
 Provisioning
 Groups
 Audit
 States
 Formulas
 Recurring Actions
 Events


The menu:Systems[Details > Overview] subtab is displayed by default.
Which tabs are available is dependent on the system type of the client you have selected.

For more information about managing clients, see xref:client-configuration:client-config-overview.adoc[].
