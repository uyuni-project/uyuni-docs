The list of activation keys shows the name and description for each key, and how many times the key has been used.
It also shows if the key is currently enabled for your organization.
Click the key description to see more information about the activation key.

Click btn:[Update Activation Keys] to refresh the list with recent changes.

Click btn:[Create Key] to create a new activation key.
