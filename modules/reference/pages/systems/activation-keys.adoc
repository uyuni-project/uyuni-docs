= Activation Keys

Users with the Activation Key Administrator role (including {productname} Administrators) can generate activation keys in the {productname} {webui}.
With such an activation key, register a {sle} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, entitle the system to a {productname} service level and subscribe the system to specific channels and system groups through the [command]``rhnreg_ks`` command line utility.

[NOTE]
====
System-specific activation keys created through the [guimenu]``Reactivation`` subtab of the [guimenu]``System Details`` page are not part of this list because they are not reusable across systems.

== Managing Activation Keys

From the [guimenu]``Activation Key`` page organize activation keys for channel management.

image::systems_activation_keys.png[scaledwidth=80%]

To create an activation key:

[[pro.ref.manager.activationkey]]
.Procedure: Creating Activation Keys
. Select menu:Main Menu[Systems > Activation Keys] from the left bar.
. Click the [guimenu]``Create Key`` link at the upper right corner.
. [guimenu]``Description`` -- Enter a [guimenu]``Description`` to identify the generated activation key.
. [guimenu]``Key`` -- Either choose automatic generation by leaving this field blank or enter the key you want to generate in the [guimenu]``Key`` field. This string of characters can then be used with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` to register client systems with {productname}. For more details, see xref:reference:systems/activation-keys.adoc[].
+
[WARNING]
.Allowed Characters
====
ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2011-03-24 - ke: bwiedemann 20110210:
# wirklich alle? auch "'\ und 0 bytes? Also see the quick starts!
# 2016-02-17 - moio: ," are not allowed <> (){} will get removed automatically
endif::showremarks[]

Do not insert commas or double quotes in the key.
All other characters are allowed, but `<> (){}` (this includes the space) will get removed automatically.
If the string is empty, a random one is generated.

Commas are problematic because they are used as separator when two or more activation keys are used at once.
====
+
. [guimenu]``Usage`` -- The maximum number systems that can be registered with the activation key concurrently. Leave blank for unlimited use. Deleting a system profile reduces the usage count by one and registering a system profile with the key increases the usage count by one.
. [guimenu]``Base Channels`` -- The primary channel for the key. This can be either the `{productname} Default` channel, a {suse} provided channel, or a custom base channel.
+
Selecting `{productname} Default` allows client systems to register with the {suse}-provided default channel that corresponds with their installed version of {sle}.
You can also associate the key with a custom base channel.
If a system using this key is not compatible with the selected channel, it will fall back to the {productname} default channel.
. [guimenu]``Child Channels`` -- When the base channel is selected the list of available child channels will get fetched and display in real time below the base channel.
Select the child channels you need (for example, the Tools child channel).
. [guimenu]``Add-on System Types`` -- The supplemental system types for the key, for example, Virtualization Host. All systems will receive these system types with the key.
. [guimenu]``Contact Method`` - Select how clients communicate with {productname}. [guimenu]``Default`` (Pull) waits for the client to check in. With [guimenu]``Push via SSH`` and [guimenu]``Push via SSH tunnel`` the server contacts the client via SSH (with or without tunnel) and pushes updates and actions, etc.
+
For more information about contact methods, see
xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-intro.adoc[].


. [guimenu]``Universal Default`` -- Select whether this key should be considered the primary activation key for your organization.
+
.Changing the Default Activation Key
WARNING: Only one universal default activation key can be defined per organization.
If a universal key already exists for this organization, you will unset the currently used universal key by activating the check box.
+

. Click btn:[Create Activation Key].


To create more activation keys, repeat the steps above.

After creating the unique key, it appears in the list of activation keys along with the number of times it has been used.
Only Activation Key Administrators can see this list.
At this point, you can configure the key further.
For example, associate the key with packages (for example, the [package]#mgr-cfg-actions#  package) and groups.
Systems registered with the key get automatically subscribed to them.

To change the settings of a key, click the key's description in the list to display its [guimenu]``Details`` page. Via additional tabs you can select packages, configuration channels, group membership, and view activated systems.
Modify the appropriate tab then click the btn:[Update Activation Key] button.
To disassociate groups from a key, deselect them in the respective menus by kbd:[Ctrl]-clicking their highlighted names.
To remove a key entirely, click the [guimenu]``Delete Key`` link in the upper right corner of the [guimenu]``Details`` page.
In the upper right corner find also the [guimenu]``Clone Key`` link.

image::systems_activation_key_details.png[scaledwidth=80%]

Any (client tools) package installation requires that the Client Tools channel is available and the [guimenu]``Provisioning`` check box is selected.
The Client Tools channel should be selected in the [guimenu]``Child Channels`` listing below the selected base channel.

After creating the activation key, you can see in the [guimenu]``Details`` tab a check box named [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment``.
If you select it, all needed packages are automatically added to the [guimenu]``Packages`` list.
In case of Salt clients the [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` option also ensures that highstate will get applied automatically.
By default, the following packages are added: [package]#mgr-cfg#, [package]#mgr-cfg-client#, and [package]#mgr-cfg-actions#.

If you select [guimenu]``Virtualization Host`` you automatically get the following package: [package]#mgr-virtualization-host#.

Adding the [package]#mgr-osad# package makes sense to execute scheduled actions immediately after the schedule time.
When the activation key is created, you can add packages with selecting the key (menu:Main Menu[Systems > Activation Keys]), then on the activation key details page, go for the [guimenu]``Packages`` tab and add [package]#mgr-osad#.

To disable system activations with a key, uncheck the corresponding box in the [guimenu]``Enabled`` column in the key list.
The key can be re-enabled by selecting the check box.
Click the btn:[Update Activation Keys] button on the bottom right-hand corner of the page to apply your changes.



[[s3-sm-system-keys-multiple]]
== Using Multiple Activation Keys at Once

Multiple activation keys can be specified at the command line or in a single autoinstallation profile with traditional clients.

// Does it make sense to mention this restriction here, too? 2020-04-23, ke.
// https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1164451
[NOTE]
====
With Salt clients, you cannot combine activation keys.
Only the first key will be used.
====

This allows you to aggregate the aspects of various keys without re-creating a specific key for every system that you want to register, simplifying the registration and autoinstallation processes while slowing the growth of your key list.
Separate keys with a comma at the command line with [command]``rhnreg_ks`` or in a {kickstart} profile in the [guimenu]``Activation Keys`` tab of the [guimenu]``Autoinstallation Details`` page.

Registering with multiple activation keys requires some caution.
Conflicts between some values cause registration to fail.
Conflicts in the following values do not cause registration to fail, a combination of values is applied: software packages, software child channels, and configuration channels.
Conflicts in the remaining properties are resolved in the following manner:

* Base software channels: registration fails.
* System types: registration fails.
* Enable configuration flag: configuration management is set.


Do not use system-specific activation keys along with other activation keys; registration fails in this event.

You are now ready to use multiple activation keys at once.
