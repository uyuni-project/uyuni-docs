View the details about an action from the action list.
In the [guimenu]``Actions`` column, click the btn:[Details] icon for the action you are interested in.


Disabling Recurring Actions::

Disabling an action stops the action recurring, but does not delete it.
To disable a recurring action toggle the [guimenu]``Active`` switch off.
Enable them again by toggling the [guimenu]``Active`` switch on.
Disabled recurring actions remain in the list, but are not executed.


Edit Recurring Actions::

Edit an existing recurring action.
In the [guimenu]``Actions`` column, click the btn:[Edit] icon for the action you want to change.
On the [guimenu]``Schedule Recurring Highstate`` page, the existing properties are pre-filled.
Make your changes, and click btn:[Update Schedule].


Delete Recurring Actions::

Deleting an action permanently removes it.
To start using the action again, you will need to create a new action.
In the [guimenu]``Actions`` column, click the btn:[Delete] icon for the action you want to delete, and confirm the deletion.
