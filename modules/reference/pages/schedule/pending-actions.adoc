The menu:Schedule[Pending Actions] section shows actions that are in progress, or that have not yet started.
Use the [guimenu]``Filter by Action`` field to search the list.

Cancel pending actions by checking the action in the list, and clicking btn:[Cancel Actions].
If you archive a pending action, it is not canceled, but the action item moves from the [guimenu]``Pending Actions`` list to the [guimenu]``Archived Actions`` list.
