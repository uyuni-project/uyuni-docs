[[ref-spacecmd-api]]
= api

The following API command and its options are available for calling the XML-RPC API directly.
Calling the API directly allows you to use the latest features in SUSE Manager from the command-line using spacecmd as a wrapper for stand-alone commands or used from within scripts.

.Use the api Command for Access to Latest Features
[NOTE]
====
spacecmd is the traditional tool for spacewalk.
It functions out of the box with SUSE Manager but you should know that latest features (for example, Salt) are often excluded from traditional spacecmd command-line tool.
To gain access to the latest feature additions call [command]``api api.getApiCallList`` from within spacecmd to list all currently available API commands formatted in json.
You can then call these commands directly.
