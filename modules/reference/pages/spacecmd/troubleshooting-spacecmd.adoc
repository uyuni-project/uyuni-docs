== Creating a Distribution With spacecmd Sets Localhost Instead of FQDN

The support article associated with this issue may be located at link:https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7018627[]

Situation::
When creating a distribution with spacecmd it will  automatically set localhost as the server name instead of the FQDN of SUSE Manager.
This will result in the following kernel option being written:

[source]
--
install=http://localhost/ks/dist/<distributionname>
--

Resolution::
Set the FQDN in [path]``$HOME/.spacecmd/config``
like the following:
+

[source]
--
test:~/.spacecmd # cat config

[spacecmd]
server=test.mytest.env
username=admin
password=password
nossl=0
--

Cause::
This problem may be experienced if [path]``$HOME/.spacecmd/config``
has been created and the server name option was set to localhost.



== Spacecmd not Accepting Commands or Options


When running [command]``spacecmd`` non-interactively, you must escape arguments passed to the command.
Always put ``--`` before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments.
Additionally, make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted.
An example of a well-formed [command]``spacecmd`` command:

[source]
--
spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \'My Channel\' -l channel1 -a x86_64
--



== Spacecmd caching problems


The [command]``spacecmd`` command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed.
Sometimes, this can result in a mismatch between the system name and the system ID.
To clear the [command]``spacecmd`` cache, use this command:

[source]
--
spacecmd clear_caches
--
