= Troubleshooting spacecmd


This section provides troubleshooting solutions when working with spacecmd

== Creating a distribution wiere ``spacecmd`` sets ``localhost`` instead of FQDN

Situation::
When creating a distribution with spacecmd it will automatically set [literal]``localhost`` as the server name instead of the FQDN of {productname}.
This will result in the following kernel option being written:

[source]
--
install=http://localhost/ks/dist/<distributionname>
--

Resolution::
Set the FQDN in [path]``$HOME/.spacecmd/config``
like the following:
+

[source]
--
test:~/.spacecmd # cat config

[spacecmd]
server=test.mytest.env
username=admin
password=password
nossl=0
--

Cause::
This problem may be experienced if [path]``$HOME/.spacecmd/config``
has been created and the server name option was set to [literal]``localhost``.



== ``spacecmd`` not accepting commands or options


When running [command]``spacecmd`` non-interactively:

* you must escape arguments passed to the command.
* always put ``--`` before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments.
* make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted.

An example of a well-formed [command]``spacecmd`` command:

[source]
--
spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \'My Channel\' -l channel1 -a x86_64
--



== ``spacecmd`` caching problems


The [command]``spacecmd`` command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed.
Sometimes, this can result in a mismatch between the system name and the system ID.


To clear the [command]``spacecmd`` cache, use this command:

[source]
--
spacecmd clear_caches
--
