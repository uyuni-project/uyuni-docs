== time
Dates can be any of the following:

[source]
----
Explicit Dates:
Dates can be expressed as explicit date strings in the YYYYMMDD[HHMM] format.
The year, month and day are required, while the hours and minutes are not; the hours and minutes will default to 0000 if no values are provided.

Deltas:
Dates can be expressed as delta values.
For example, '2h' would mean 2 hours in the future.
You can also use negative values to express times in the past (e.g., -7d would be one week ago).

Units:
s -> seconds
m -> minutes
h -> hours
d -> days
