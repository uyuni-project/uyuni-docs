include::{localesdir-ref}[]


The menu:Audit[CVE Audit] section shows you which CVEs have been applied to your clients.
A CVE (common vulnerabilities and exposures) is a fix for a publicly known security vulnerability.
It is important that you apply CVEs to your clients as soon as they become available.

Each CVE contains an identification number, a description of the vulnerability, and links to further information.
CVE identification numbers use the form ``CVE-YEAR-XXXX``.

Clients are listed with a patch status icon.
