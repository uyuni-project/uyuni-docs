The menu:Users[User List > Deactivated] section shows all deactivated users in your {productname} Server.

Each user in the list shows the username, real name, assigned roles, the date the user last signed in, the user who deactivated the account, and the date the account was deactivated.
Click btn:[Create User] to create a new user account.
Click the username to go to the [guimenu]``User Details`` page.

To reactivate a user, check the username in the list and click btn:[Reactivate].
