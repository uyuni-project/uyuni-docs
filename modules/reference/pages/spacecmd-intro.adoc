[[ref-spacecmd]]
= spacecmd Reference


The following section will help you become more familiar with the [command]``spacecmd`` command-line interface.
This interface is available for {productname}, Satellite and Spacewalk servers.
spacecmd is written in Python and uses the XML-RPC API provided by the server.

.What can spacecmd do for me?
* Manage almost all aspects of SUSE Manager from the command line with spacecmd
* Tab completion is available for all commands
* Single commands can be passed to spacecmd without entering the interactive shell (excellent for shell scripts)
* May also be accessed and used as an interactive shell
* Advanced search methods are available for finding specific systems, thus removing the need to create system groups (nevertheless groups are still recommended)
* Complete functionality through the Spacewalk API. Almost all commands that can be executed from the {webui} can be performed via the spacecmd command-line
