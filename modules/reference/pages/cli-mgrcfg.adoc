The `mgrcfg` CLI tool has three components:


[[mgrcfg-components]]
.Configuration CLI Tool Components
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Tool name | Installed on | Use for
| ``mgrcfg-client`` | Client | Managing client configuration
| ``mgr-cfg-manager`` | Server | Managing server configuration
| ``mgr-actions-control`` | Server | Administer configuration settings
|===


Clients do not have configuration management enabled by default.
To get started, install the ``mgr-actions-control`` tool on the {productname} Server, and use it to enable configuration management for your organization.



== Actions Control (mgr-actions-control)

Use the ``mgr-actions-control`` tool to enable and disable configuration management on a client.
Actions that can be performed with ``mgr-actions-control`` include:

* Deploy a configuration file on a client
* Upload a file from the client
* Compare the configuration tools available on a client, with what is being used
* Run remote commands


[IMPORTANT]
====
You must be logged in to {productname} with an administrator account to use ``mgr-actions-control``.
====

This tool works by adding or removing files and directories on the client in the [path]``/etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/`` directory.
By default, this directory requires root permissions.

The available options for ``mgr-actions-control`` are listed in this table.
Use this syntax for ``mgr-actions-control`` commands:

----
mgr-actions-control [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option]
----

For more information about the available options for the ``mgr-actions-control`` tool, see the man page:

----
man mgr-actions-control
----



== Client Configuration (mgrcfg-client)

Use the ``mgrcfg-client`` tool to manage configuration on a client.
The ``mgrcfg-client`` has these primary modes:

* list
* get
* channels
* diff
* verify

The available commands and arguments for ``mgrcfg-client`` are listed in this section.
Use this syntax for ``mgrcfg-client`` commands:

----
mgrcfg-client [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option] [mode]
----



=== List Configuration Files

The ``list`` mode lists the configuration files for the client, including the labels of the configuration channels containing them.
To see a complete list of all the configuration files that are currently applied to the client, use this command:

----
mgrcfg-client list
----

The output looks like this:

----
DoFoS   Config Channel      File
F      config-channel-17   /etc/config-file
F      config-channel-17   /var/spool/aalib.rpm
F      config-channel-14   /etc/rhn/rhn.conf
----

In this output, ``DoFoS`` means ``Directory, File, or Something else``.
Each entry in the output will be marked with ``D``, ``F``, or ``S``.
These configuration files apply to the client.

Get more detail about a channel by specifying the channel name:

----
mgrcfg-manager list config-channel-14
----

The output looks like this:

----
Files in config channel 'config-channel-14'
/etc/config-file /etc/rhn/rhn.conf
----

It is possible that there are duplicate configuration files in different channels.
In this case, the file listing for the channel shows files that are not present when listing channels applied to the client.
This is a result of file ranking, which means that channels can contain files that are not applied to the client, because they are outranked by a different file from a different channel.



=== Get Configuration Files

The ``get`` mode displays the contents of the primary configuration file for the client.
To see the configuration file with the highest rank within the channel, use this command:

----
mgrcfg-client get
----

To see a specific configuration file, use this command:

----
mgrcfg-client get <FILENAME>
----


The available options for ``mgrcfg-client get`` are listed in this table.

[[mgrcfg-client-get-options]]
.Client Get Mode Options

|===

| Option
| Abbreviated Option
| Description

| topdir=TOPDIR
|
| Make all file operations relative to this string.

| exclude=EXCLUDE
|
| Exclude a file from being deployed with get.
  Can be used multiple times.

| help
| h
| Show help message and exit.

|===



=== Channels

The ``channels`` mode lists the configuration channels for the client.
To see a complete list of all the configuration channels that are currently applied to the client, use this command:

----
mgrcfg-client channels
----

The output looks like this:

----
Config channels:
Label                   Name
-----                   ----
config-channel-17       config chan 2
config-channel-14       config chan 1
----



=== Differentiating Configuration Files

The ``diff`` mode shows the differences between the configuration files deployed on the client and those stored by {productname}.
Use this command:

----
mgrcfg-client diff
----

The output looks like this:

----
rhncfg-client diff
--- /etc/test
+++ /etc/test 2020-08-28 00:14:49.405152824 +1000
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
This is the first line
+This is the second line added
----

You can use the [option]``--topdir`` option to compare configuration files with those located in an arbitrary unused location on the client, like this:

----
# mgrcfg-client diff --topdir /home/test/example/
----



=== Verify Configuration Files

The ``verify`` mode checks if the configuration file on the client is different to the configuration associated with it.
Use this command:

----
mgrcfg-client verify
----

The output looks like this:

----
modified /etc/config-file /var/spool/aalib.rpm
----

The file [filename]``config-file`` is locally modified, while [package]``aalib.rpm`` is not.

The available options for ``mgrcfg-client verify`` are listed in this table.

|===


== Server Configuration (mgrcfg-manager)

Use the ``mgrcfg-manager`` tool to manage the configuration files and channels on the {productname} Server.
It does not manage configuration on a client.

The ``mgrcfg-manager`` tool has these primary modes:

* add
* create-channel
* diff
* diff-revisions
* download-channel
* get
* list
* list-channels
* remove
* remove-channel
* revisions
* update
* upload-channel

Each mode has further options.
See the available options using this syntax:

----
mgrcfg-manager <MODE> --help
----

The available commands and arguments for ``mgrcfg-manager`` are listed in this section.
Use this syntax for ``mgrcfg-manager`` commands:

----
mgrcfg-manager [-h] [--version] [-v] [mode] [--option]
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, the ``mgrcfg-manager`` tool times out after thirty minutes.
You can change this value in the [path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` configuration file by adding or adjusting this line, with a value in minutes:

----
server.session_lifetime = <MINUTES>
----

====



=== Add Files to a Configuration Channel

The ``add`` mode adds a configuration file from your local filesystem to an existing channel.
Use this command:

----
mgrcfg-manager add --channel=<channel-label> <local/path/to/file>
----

You can use options to modify the file during addition.
For example, to change the path or file name, use this command:

----
mgrcfg-manager add --channel=<channel-label> \
  --dest-file=</new/path/to/file> <local/path/to/file>
----

The output looks like this:

----
Pushing to channel <channel-label>
Local file <local/path/to/file> -> remote file </new/path/to/file>
----


The available options for ``mgrcfg-manager add`` are listed in this table.

For information about changing the maximum file size value, see xref:reference:configuration/config-files-menu.adoc[].
====



=== Create a Configuration Channel

The ``create-channel`` mode creates a new configuration channel.
Use this command:

----
mgrcfg-manager create-channel <channel-label>
----

When you have created a configuration channel, you can add configuration files to it with the ``add`` mode.



=== Differentiate Between Configuration Files

The ``diff`` mode shows the differences between the stored configuration files and the latest revisions in the associated channel.
Use this command:

----
mgrcfg-manager diff --channel=<channel-label>
  --dest-file=</path/to/file> </local/path/to/file>
----

The output looks like this:

----
--- </path/to/file> config_channel: <channel-label> revision: 1

=== Differentiate between Revisions

The ``diff-revisions`` mode shows the differences between the revisions of configuration files.

This command can compare revisions across different channels.
Use the ``-r`` option to indicate which revision of the file should be compared and the ``-n`` option to indicate the two channels to be checked.
In this case, specify only one file name, because the file is being compared to a different revision of itself.
Use this command:

----
mgrcfg-manager diff-revisions -n=<channel-label-1> -r=1 \
  -n=<channel-label-2> -r=1 </path/to/file>
----

The output looks like this:
