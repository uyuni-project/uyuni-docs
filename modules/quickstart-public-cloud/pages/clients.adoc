= Register Clients

When you have your {productname} Server set up, you are ready to start registering clients.
There are several ways to register clients to your {productname} Server:

* For Salt clients, we recommend that you register clients using the {productname} {webui}.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-webui.adoc[].
* If you want more control over the process, have to register many clients, or are registering traditional clients, we recommend that you create a bootstrap script.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-bootstrap.adoc[].
* For Salt clients and even more control over the process, executing single commands on the command line can be useful.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-cli.adoc[].


To make managing large sets of clients easier, add them to the system set manager (SSM).
For more on SSM, see xref:client-configuration:using-ssm.adoc[].
