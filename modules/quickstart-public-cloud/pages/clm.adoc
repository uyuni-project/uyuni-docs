= Content Lifecycle Management


Content lifecycle management allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients.
This is especially useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window.

This is achieved through a series of environments that your software channels can move through on their lifecycle.
Most environment lifecycles include at least test and production environments, but you can have as many environments as you require.

When you have created your project, defined environments, and attached sources and filters, you can build the project for the first time.
For more information about content lifecycle management, see xref:administration:content-lifecycle.adoc[].

When your project is built successfully, you will need to add the new channel to an activation key.
For more information about custom channels, see xref:administration:custom-channels.adoc[].
