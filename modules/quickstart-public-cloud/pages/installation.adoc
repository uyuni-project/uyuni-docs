= Installation

Public Cloud providers pre-install {productname}, so you do not need to perform any installation steps.
However, {productname} Server needs to be registered with {scc} to receive updates before you can sign in.
For detailed instructions on registering {productname} to {scc}, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[].

When you have registered, all {sle} modules will be activated.
You will also need to activate the public cloud module.
For more information on activating public clouds, see xref:modules/installation/pages/pubcloud-setup.adoc[].

An administrator account is created by default.
The username and password varies depending on your provider.
