= Installation

Public clouds provide {productname} under a Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) model.
That means that they pre-install {productname}, so you do not need to perform any installation steps.
However, {productname} Server needs to be registered with {scc} to receive updates before you can sign in.


Follow the cloud providers instructions to SSH into the instance.

Run this command to start set up:

----
yast2 susemanager_setup
----

Follow the prompts, and wait for the setup to finish.

For detailed instructions on setting up {productname} with {yast}, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[].

Register your instance with {scc}, using this command as root, specifying the registration number and the email address associated with it:

----
SUSEConnect -r <Registration_Number> -e <registered_email_address>
----

You can get your registration number by logging in to {scc} from your browser.

For more information about registering {productname} with {scc}, see xref:installation:general-requirements.adoc[].

When you have registered, all {sle} modules will be activated.
You will also need to activate the Public Cloud module.
Do this from the command prompt on your instance:

----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-public-cloud/15.2/x86_64
----

For more information on activating public clouds, see xref:installation:pubcloud-setup.adoc[].


Open the {productname} {webui} with a web browser, using an address like this:

----
https://<public_IP>
----

Sign in to the {productname} {webui} with the administrator account.
The username and password varies depending on your provider.

.Default Administrator Account Details
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Provider              | Default Username  | Default Password
| Amazon EC2            | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Google Compute Engine | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Microsoft Azure       | ``admin``         |``<instance-name>-suma``
|===


When you sign in to the administrator account for the first time, you will have an automatically generated organization name.
Change this by navigating to menu:Admin[Organizations], and editing the organization name.


[IMPORTANT]
====
When you have signed in to the administrator account for the first time, change the default password to protect your account.

For more information about setting up your {productname} Server, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[].


Use the {productname} {webui} to add the required software products, and schedule a repository synchronization.
The best way to do this is to navigate to menu:Admin[Setup Wizard] and follow the prompts.

For more information about the setup wizard, see xref:installation:setup-wizard.adoc[].


If you are intending to register {ubuntu} or {rhel} clients, you will need to set up custom repositories and channels.
For more information, see xref:client-configuration:non-suse-clients.adoc[].


To synchronize your channels, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels].
Click each channel you created, navigate to the menu:Repositories[Sync] tab, and click btn:[Sync Now].
You can also schedule synchronization from this screen.


[IMPORTANT]
====
You need all the new channels fully synchronized before bootstrapping any openSUSE client.
openSUSE channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
