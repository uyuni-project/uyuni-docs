= Setting up

This guide shows you the fastest way to get {productname} up and running in a public cloud using on-demand or BYOS services.
We have tested using {productname} on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation.

There are three main methods of using {productname} on a public cloud service.

Bring your ownÂ subscription (BYOS)::
Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of {productname} available.
This means you do not need to install {productname}, just set up the server.
You will need to have {suse} product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required.
The public cloud documentation in the {productname} documentation suite assumes you are using this method.

Virtual machine on public cloud::
In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install {productname} in a virtual machine, using the unified installer.
You will need to have {suse} product entitlements before you begin.
You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local {productname} installation.

On-demand {sles} pay as you go (PAYG) image::
Most public cloud providers make {sles} available as a BYOS image.
This means that {sles} is pre-installed, and you can install {productname} on top, using the unified installer.
You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local {productname} installation.
You will need to have {suse} product entitlements before you begin.
Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs.


If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a {productname} instance.
Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the {productname} Server BYOS images by searching for ``suse manager``.
In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs.
In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace.

Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware  and networking requirements in xref:installation:pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].

When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up {productname}.
This is done in the same way as a local installation, using {yast}.
When you have completed {productname} setup, you need to activate the public cloud module.
You can then complete setup in the {productname} {webui}.
For more information about setting up, see xref:installation:pubcloud-setup.adoc[].
