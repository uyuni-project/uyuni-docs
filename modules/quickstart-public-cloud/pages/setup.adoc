= Setting Up


Public clouds provide {productname} under a Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) model.
This means that you must register instances with the {scc}.
For more information about registering {productname} with {scc}, see xref:installation:general-requirements.adoc[].

Depending on the public cloud framework you are using, you can locate the {productname} images by searching for the  keywords ``suse``, ``manager``, ``proxy``, or ``BYOS``.
Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware requirements in xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

[WARNING]
====
A world-accessible {productname} instance violates the terms of the {productname} EULA, and is not supported by {suse}.
====

To access the {productname} {webui}, allow HTTPS when configuring the network access controls.

We recommend that the repositories and the database for {productname} are stored on a seperate storage device.
This will help to avoid data loss in cases when the {productname} instance is terminated.
You must set up the storage device before you run the YaST {productname} setup procedure.

For more on setting up a seperate storage volume, see xref:modules/installation/pages/pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].
