[[quickstart-publiccloud-setup]]
= Setting Up



We have tested these instructions on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but they should work on other providers as well, with some variation.

You need to start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a {productname} instance.

Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the {productname} images by searching for the  keywords ``suse``, ``manager``, or ``BYOS``.

In AWS, you will need to search within the Community AMIs.

.SUSEÂ Manager Image Names
[cols="1,1, 1", options="header"]
|===
| Provider              | Image Name | Architecture
| Amazon EC2            | suse-manager-4-0-server-byos-v20200226-hvm-ssd-x86_64 | {x86}
| Google Compute Engine |     | {x86}
| Microsoft Azure       |     | {x86}
|===

Select a public cloud instance type with at least:

* 32{nbsp}GB RAM
* 8 cores

 For more information about hardware requirements, see xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

[WARNING]
====
When running {productname} on public clouds, make sure you apply security measures to limit access to the right people.
A world-accessible {productname} would give access to your infrastructure to anyone, and could breach your {suse} support agreement.
====


Launch your new {productname} instance.
When it is running, you can configure the network access controls to allow HTTPS.
This allows you to access the {productname} {webui}.

Amazon EC2::

Set the security group rules when you create the instance, or you can do it once the instance is running:

. From the EC2 Console, naviagte to menu:Network & Security[Security Groups]
. Click the security group to edit, or create a new one.
. Click btn:[Edit inbound rules]
. In the [guimenu]``Type`` field, select [parameter]``HTTPS``, edit any other required fields, and click btn:[Save rules].
. Repeat for outbound rules.

We recommend that the repositories and the database for {productname} are stored on a separate storage volume.
For more information, see xref:installation:pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].

Public clouds provide {productname} under a Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS) model.
This means that you must register instances with the {scc}.
For more information about registering {productname} with {scc}, see xref:installation:general-requirements.adoc[].
