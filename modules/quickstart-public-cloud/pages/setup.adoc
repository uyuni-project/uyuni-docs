= Setting Up


We have tested these instructions on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but they should work on other providers as well, with some variation.

You need to start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a {productname} instance.

Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the {productname} images by searching for ``suse manager``.
In EC2, you will need to search within the Community AMIs.
In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace.

As you prepare your new instance, pay attention to these settings:

For hardware, select an instance with at least:

* 32{nbsp}GB RAM
* 8 cores

For more information about hardware requirements, see xref:installation:hardware-requirements.adoc[].

For security and access settings, you will need to enable HTTPS access.
This allows you to access the {productname} {webui}.

In EC2 and Azure, create a new security group, and add inbound and outbound rules for HTTPS.
In GCE, check the ``Allow HTTPS traffic`` box under the ``Firewall`` section.

[WARNING]
====
When running {productname} on public clouds, make sure you apply security measures to limit access to the right people.
A world-accessible {productname} would give access to your infrastructure to anyone, and could breach your {suse} support agreement.
====

For storage settings, make sure you have at least 100GB.
We also recommend that the repositories and the database for {productname} are stored on separate storage volumes.

For more information about setting up a public cloud instance, see xref:installation:pubcloud-requirements.adoc[].




Launch your new {productname} instance.
