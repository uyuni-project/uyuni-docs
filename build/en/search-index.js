Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

What is Uyuni? 2. Available Documentation Documentation version: 2024.01 Uyuni is a solution for organizations that require robust control over maintenance and package deployment on their servers. It enables you to manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up-to-date, with automated software management, asset management, and system provisioning. It also allows you to maintain a high level of security while effectively managing system life-cycle requirements. Uyuni uses Salt to provide event-driven configuration and management control. The Salt-master orchestrates tens of thousands of Salt clients (Uyuni clients) using remote execution. Uyuni offers seamless management of SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, Amazon Linux, AlmaLinux, and Raspberry Pi OS client systems. They can be on-premise, or on public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud or even multi-cloud environments. If you cannot use the Uyuni Web UI, almost all functionality (with the exception of virtualization tasks) is available from the command prompt. All command line tools can be used with assistive technology tools. Text readers orca and espeak can be enabled in the Desktop Applications Module. Speech recognition mycroft-core and sphinx are available in PackageHub. Additionally, you can interact with Uyuni using the XML-RPC API. For more information about spacecmd, see spacecmd Reference. For more information about other command line tools, see Command Line Tools. For more information about the API, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/uyuni-docs-api/uyuni/index.html.

Action Chains 3. Remote Commands You can manage actions on your clients in a number of different ways: You can schedule automated recurring actions to apply the highstate or an arbitrary set of custom states to clients on a specified schedule. You can apply recurring actions to individual clients, to all clients in a system group, or to an entire organization. You can set actions to be performed in a particular order by creating action chains. Action chains can be created and edited ahead of time, and scheduled to run at a time that suits you. You can also perform remote commands on one or more of your Salt clients. Remote commands allows you to issue commands to individual Salt clients, or to all clients that match a search term. You can apply recurring actions on individual Salt clients, to a system group, or to all clients in an organization. Currently, Uyuni supports the following action types as recurring actions: Highstate: Execute the highstate. Custom state: Execute a set of custom states. A custom state can be either an internal state provided by Uyuni, or a configuration channel created by a user. For more information about configuration channels, see Configuration Management. Procedure: Creating a New Recurring Action To apply a recurring action to an individual client, navigate to Systems, click the client to configure schedules for, and navigate to the Recurring Actions tab. To apply a recurring action to a system group, navigate to Systems System Groups, select the group to configure schedules for, and navigate to Recurring Actions tab. Click Create. Select an action type from the Action Type dropdown. Type a name for the new schedule. Choose the frequency of the recurring action: Hourly: Type the minute of each hour. For example, 15 runs the action at fifteen minutes past every hour. Daily: Select the time of each day. For example, 01:00 runs the action at 0100 every day, in the timezone of the Uyuni Server. Weekly: Select the day of the week and the time of the day, to execute the action every week at the specified time. Monthly: Select the day of the month and the time of the day, to execute the action every month at the specified time. Custom Quartz format: For more detailed options, enter a custom quartz string. For example, to run a recurring action at 0215 every Saturday of every month, enter: 0 15 2 ? * 7 OPTIONAL: Toggle the Test mode switch on to run the schedule in test mode. For actions of type Custom state, select the states from the list of available states and click Save Changes. This will only save the current state selection and not the schedule. In the next pane, drag and drop the selected states to put them in the execution order and click Confirm. Click Create Schedule to save, and see the complete list of existing schedules. Organization Administrators can set and edit recurring actions for all clients in the organization. Navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions to see all recurring actions that apply to the entire organization. Uyuni Administrators can set and edit recurring actions for all clients in all organizations. Navigate to Admin Organizations, select the organization to manage, and navigate to the States Recurring Actions tab. If you need to perform a number of sequential actions on your clients, you can create an action chain to ensure the order is respected. By default, most clients execute an action as soon as the command is issued. In some case, actions take a long time, which could mean that actions issued afterwards fail. For example, if you instruct a client to reboot, then issue a second command, the second action could fail because the reboot is still occurring. To ensure that actions occur in the correct order, use action chains. For transactional update systems, an action chain is executed inside a single snapshot, until there is a reboot action. This can cause some limitations. For more information, see Registering SLE Micro Clients and Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients. You can use action chains on all clients. Action chains can include any number of these actions, in any order: System Details Remote Command System Details Schedule System Reboot System Details States Highstate System Details Software Packages List/Remove System Details Software Packages Install System Details Software Packages Upgrade System Details Software Patches System Details Software Software Channels System Details Configuration Images Build Procedure: Creating a New Action Chain In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the first action you want to perform in the action chain. For example, navigate to System Details for a client, and click Schedule System Reboot. Check the Add to field and select the action chain you want to add to: If this is your first action chain, select new action chain. If the action chain already exists, select it from the list. If you already have existing action chains, but you want to create a new action chain, start typing a name for the new action chain to create it. Confirm the action. The action is not performed immediately, it creates the new action chain, and a blue bar confirming this appears at the top of the screen. Continue adding actions to your action chain by checking the Add to field and selecting the name of the action chain to add them to. When you have finished adding actions, navigate to Schedule Action Chains and selecting the action chain from the list. Re-order actions by dragging them and dropping them into the correct position. Click the blue plus sign to see the clients an action is to be performed on. Click Save to save your changes. Schedule a time for your action chain to run, and click Save and Schedule. If you leave the page without clicking either Save or Save and Schedule all unsaved changes are discarded. If one action in an action chain fails, the action chain stops, and no further actions are executed. You can see scheduled actions from action chains by navigating to Schedule Pending Actions. You can configure clients to run commands remotely. This allows you to issue scripts or individual commands to a client, without having access to the client directly. This feature is automatically enabled on Salt clients, and you do not need to perform any further configuration. You can use this procedure to enable it manually, instead. Before you begin, ensure your client is subscribed to the appropriate tools child channel for its installed operating system. For more information about subscribing to software channels, see Software Channels. For transactional update systems, consider that a remote command is run inside a single snapshot. This can cause some limitations. For more information, see Registering SLE Micro Clients and Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients. Remote commands are run from the /tmp/ directory on the client. To ensure that remote commands work accurately, do not mount /tmp with the noexec option. For more information, see Troubleshooting Mounting /tmp with noexec. All commands run from the Remote Commands page are executed as root on clients. Wildcards can be used to run commands across any number of systems. Always take extra care to check your commands before issuing them. Procedure: Running Remote Commands on Salt Clients Navigate to Salt Remote Commands. In the first field, before the @ symbol, type the command you want to issue. In the second field, after the @ symbol, type the client you want to issue the command on. You can type the minion-id of an individual client, or you can use wildcards to target a range of clients. Click Find targets to check which clients you have targeted, and confirm that you have used the correct details. Click Run command to issue the command to the target clients.","title":"Actions","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"actions","url":"/uyuni/administration/actions.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Requirements and basic configuration 3. Inventory inspection 4. Playbook discovery 5. Playbook execution Currently, the supported version of Ansible is 2.9 (LTS) shipped in SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Client Tools channels. The supported OS version for the Ansible Control Node is SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3, or later. Ansible software is also available for Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni for Retail Branch Server. For Control Nodes running operating systems other than SUSE Linux Enterprise, use Ansible shipped together with your distribution. Uyuni enables system administrators to operate their Ansible Control Nodes. Supported features are: inspection of inventory files discovery of playbooks execution of playbooks For more information: The inventory is a sorted list of managed Ansible nodes. For more information about organizing an inventory, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html. Playbooks are a way to describe how the inventory is to be managed. For more information about playbooks, see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html. To use Ansible features, you need to register the already existing Ansible Control Node as a Salt client to the Uyuni Server. In the Web UI, on the System Details Properties page of the registered system, you must enable the Ansible Control Node system type of the Add-on System Types list. Enabling the Ansible Control Node system type ensures that the ansible package is installed on the system by adding it in the highstate and activates the Ansible features under the System Details Ansible tab. As the next step, configure the paths to your Ansible inventory and playbook files on the System Details Ansible Control Node page. As an inventory path, you can use the standard Ansible inventory path /etc/ansible/hosts. As a playbook directory, you can use any directory on the control node, where your playbook files are stored. A playbook directory either contains .yml files or subdirectories with .yml files. For installing and setting up an Ansible Control Node, see Setup Ansible control node. After defining an inventory path, you can use Uyuni to inspect its contents. Procedure: Inspecting an inventory from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to System Details Ansible Inventories Click an inventory path to execute the inventory inspection on the Control Node in real-time. After defining a playbook directory, you can discover playbooks on the System Details Ansible Playbooks page. As with the inventory inspection, the playbook discovery operations run on the Control Node in real-time. You can schedule a playbook execution from the System Details Ansible Playbooks page. After selecting the playbook you wish to execute, you can select the inventory file for the execution from the drop-down menu. If you do not select any item, the default inventory configured in your Control Node will be used. The drop-down menu is populated with the inventories you defined in your Inventory paths and with inventories that have been locally discovered in your playbook directories. These are displayed as Custom Inventory items in the playbook details. You can also enter an arbitrary inventory path. Afterwards, you choose the time of the playbook execution or select an action chain. Eventually, Uyuni executes the playbook as an action on the Control Node. You can see the result of the operation on the action details page.","title":"Ansible integration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"ansible-integration","url":"/uyuni/administration/ansible-integration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

CVE Status In Uyuni, you can keep track of your clients through a series of auditing tasks. You can check that your clients are up to date with all public security patches (CVEs), perform subscription matching, and use OpenSCAP to check for specification compliance. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Audit to perform auditing tasks. A CVE (common vulnerabilities and exposures) is a fix for a publicly known security vulnerability. You must apply CVEs to your clients as soon as they become available. Each CVE contains an identification number, a description of the vulnerability, and links to further information. CVE identification numbers use the form CVE-YEAR-XXXX. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Audit CVE Audit to see a list of all clients and their current patch status. By default, the CVE data is updated at 2300 every day. We recommend that before you begin a CVE audit you refresh the data to ensure you have the latest patches. Procedure: Updating CVE Data In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Task Schedules and select the cve-server-channels-default schedule. Click cve-server-channels-bunch. Click Single Run Schedule to schedule the task. Allow the task to complete before continuing with the CVE audit. Procedure: Verifying Patch Status In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Audit CVE Audit. To check the patch status for a particular CVE, type the CVE identifier in the CVE Number field. Select the patch statuses you want to look for, or leave all statuses checked to look for all. Click Audit Servers to check all systems, or click Audit Images to check all images. For more information about the patch status icons used on this page, see CVE Audit. For each system, the Next Action column provides information about what you need to do to address vulnerabilities. If applicable, a list of candidate channels or patches is also given. You can also assign systems to a System Set for further batch processing. You can use the Uyuni API to verify the patch status of your clients. Use the audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus API method. For more information about this method, see the Uyuni API Guide. The CVE status of clients is usually either affected, not affected, or patched. These statuses are based only on the information that is available to Uyuni. Within Uyuni, these definitions apply: System affected by a certain vulnerability A system which has an installed package with version lower than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. System not affected by a certain vulnerability A system which has no installed package that is also in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. System patched for a certain vulnerability A system which has an installed package with version equal to or greater than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. Relevant patch A patch known by Uyuni in a relevant channel. Relevant channel A channel managed by Uyuni, which is either assigned to the system, the original of a cloned channel which is assigned to the system, a channel linked to a product which is installed on the system or a past or future service pack channel for the system. Because of the definitions used within Uyuni, CVE audit results might be incorrect in some circumstances. For example, unmanaged channels, unmanaged packages, or non-compliant systems might report incorrectly.","title":"Auditing","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auditing","url":"/uyuni/administration/auditing.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

PAM is a suite of libraries that allows you to integrate Uyuni with a centralized authentication mechanism, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords. Uyuni supports LDAP, Kerberos, and other network-based authentication systems using PAM. Procedure: Enabling PAM Create a PAM service file at /etc/pam.d/susemanager. Filename must be in lower case and readable by tomcat user. This file is used by Uyuni to load the correct PAM configuration files: #%PAM-1.0 auth include common-auth account include common-account password include common-password session include common-session Listing 1. On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, add the sss PAM module: pam-config -a --sss This command adds the module to the /etc/pam.d/common-auth configuration file. We do not recommend editing this file directly. Enforce the use of the service file by adding this line to /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: pam_auth_service = susemanager In this example, the PAM service file is called susemanager. Restart the Uyuni services after a configuration change. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Users Create User and enable a new or existing user to authenticate with PAM. Check the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) checkbox. It is below the password and password confirmation fields. Changing the password in the Uyuni Web UI changes only the local password on the Uyuni Server. If PAM is enabled for that user, the local password might not be used at all. In the above example, for instance, the Kerberos password is not changed. Use the password change mechanism of your network service to change the password for these users. To configure system-wide authentication you can use YaST. You need to install the yast2-auth-client package. For more information about configuring PAM, the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Security Guide contains a generic example that also works for other network-based authentication methods. It also describes how to configure an active directory service.

Start by installing the Keycloak IdP, then setting up the Uyuni Server. Then you can add the endpoints as Keycloak clients, and create users. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only. SUSE does not recommend or support third-party identity service providers, and is not affiliated with Keycloak. For Keycloak support, see https://www.keycloak.org/. You can install Keycloak directly on your machine, or run it in a container. In this example, we run Keycloak in a Podman container. For more information about installing Keycloak, see the Keycloak documentation at https://www.keycloak.org/guides#getting-started. Procedure: Setting Up the Identity Service Provider Install Keycloak in a Podman container, according to the Keycloak documentation. Run the container using the -td argument to ensure the process remains running: podman run -td --name keycloak -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:21.0.1 Sign in the Keycloak Web UI as the admin user, and create an authentication realm using these details: In the Name field, enter a name for the realm. For example, SUMA. In the Endpoints field, click the SAML 2.0 Identity Provider Metadata link. This will lead you to a page where you will see the endpoints and certificate to copy into the Uyuni configuration file. When you have installed Keycloak and created the realm, you can prepare the Uyuni Server. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Server On the Uyuni Server, open the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file and edit these parameters.

Keycloak refers to endpoints as clients. Procedure: Adding Endpoints as Clients In the Keycloak Web UI, create a new client using these details: In the Client type field, select SAML. In the Client ID field, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.entityid. For example, https:///rhn/manager/sso/metadata. In the Settings tab, fine-tune the client using these details: Toggle the Sign assertions switch to On. In the Signature algorithm field, select RSA_SHA1. In the SAML Signature Key Name field, select Key ID. In the Keys tab: Set Client signature required to Off. In the Advanced tab, in the Fine Grain SAML Endpoint Configuration section, add the two endpoints using these details: In both the Assertion Consumer Service fields, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url. For example, https:///rhn/manager/sso/acs. In both the Logout Service fields, enter the endpoint specified in the server configuration file as java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.single_logout_service.url. For example, https:///rhn/manager/sso/sls. When you have added the endpoints as clients, you can configure the client scope, and map the users between Keycloak and Uyuni. Procedure: Configuring Client Scope and Mappers In the Keycloak Web UI, navigate to the Clients Client scopes tab and assign role_list as the default client scope. Navigate to the Client_scopes Mappers tab and add a mapper for user attribute uid, using the default values. This SAML attribute is expected by Uyuni. Navigate to the Client_scopes Mappers and click on role_list mapper. Set Single Role Attribute to On. Navigate to the Users Admin section and create an administrative user. This user does not need to match the Uyuni administrative user. Navigate to the Users Role mappings tab, add an attribute named uid with a value that matches the username of the Uyuni administrative user. Navigate to the Users Credentials tab, and set the same password as used by the Uyuni administrative user. . Save your changes. When you have completed the configuration, you can test that the installation is working as expected. Restart the Uyuni Server to pick up your changes, and navigate to the Uyuni Web UI. If your installation is working correctly, you are redirected to the Keycloak SSO page, where you can authenticate successfully.","title":"Example SSO Implementation","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auth-methods-sso-example","url":"/uyuni/administration/auth-methods-sso-example.html","titles":[]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Table of Contents 1. Prerequisites 2. Enable SSO Uyuni supports single sign-on (SSO) by implementing the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2 protocol. Single sign-on is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of credentials. SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data. A SAML identity service provider (IdP) provides authentication and authorization services to service providers (SP), such as Uyuni. Uyuni exposes three endpoints which must be enabled for single sign-on. SSO in Uyuni supports: Log in with SSO. Log out with service provider-initiated single logout (SLO), and Identity service provider single logout service (SLS). Assertion and nameId encryption. Assertion signatures. Message signatures with AuthNRequest, LogoutRequest, and LogoutResponses. Enable an Assertion consumer service endpoint. Enable a single logout service endpoint. Publish the SP metadata (which can be signed). SSO in Uyuni does not support: Product choosing and implementation for the identity service provider (IdP). SAML support for other products (check with the respective product documentation). For an example implementation of SSO, see Example SSO Implementation. If you change from the default authentication method to single sign-on, the new SSO credentials apply only to the Web UI. Client tools such as mgr-sync or spacecmd continue to work with the default authentication method only. Before you begin, you need to have configured an external identity service provider with these parameters. Check your IdP documentation for instructions. The mapping between the IdP user and the Uyuni user is specified in a SAML:Attribute. The SAML:Attribute must be configured in the IdP and must be passed to Uyuni in the SAML authentication. The attribute must be named uid and must contain the Uyuni user mapped to it after login. The Uyuni must be created before you activate single sign-on. You need these endpoints: Assertion consumer service (or ACS): an endpoint to accept SAML messages to establish a session into the Service Provider. The endpoint for ACS in Uyuni is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/acs Single logout service (or SLS): an endpoint to initiate a logout request from the IdP. The endpoint for SLS in Uyuni is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/sls Metadata: an endpoint to retrieve Uyuni metadata for SAML. The endpoint for metadata in Uyuni is: https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/metadata After the authentication with the IdP using the user orgadmin is successful, you are logged in to Uyuni as the orgadmin user, provided that the orgadmin user exists in Uyuni. Using SSO is mutually exclusive with other types of authentication: it is either enabled or disabled. SSO is disabled by default. Procedure: Enabling SSO If your users do not yet exist in Uyuni, create them first. Edit /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and add this line at the end of the file: java.sso = true Find the parameters you want to customize in /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf. Insert the parameters you want to customize into /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and prefix them with java.sso. For example, in /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf find: onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs To customize it, create the corresponding option in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf by prefixing the option name with java.sso.: java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs To find all the occurrences you need to change, search in the file for the placeholders YOUR-PRODUCT and YOUR-IDP-ENTITY. Every parameter comes with a brief explanation of what it is meant for. Restart the spacewalk service to pick up the changes: spacewalk-service restart When you visit the Uyuni URL, you are redirected to the IdP for SSO where you are requested to authenticate. Upon successful authentication, you are redirected to the Uyuni Web UI, logged in as the authenticated user.

Archive Log Settings 6. Retrieve an Overview of Occupied Database Space 7. Move the Database 8. Recover From a Crashed Root Partition 9. Database Connection Information Back up your Uyuni installation regularly, to prevent data loss. Because Uyuni relies on a database as well as the installed program and configurations, it is important to back up all components of your installation. This chapter contains information on the files you need to back up, and introduces the smdba tool to manage database backups. It also contains information about restoring from your backups in the case of a system failure. Regardless of the backup method you use, you must have available at least three times the amount of space your current installation uses. Running out of space can result in backups failing, so check this often. The most comprehensive method for backing up your Uyuni installation is to back up the relevant files and directories. This can save you time in administering your backup, and can be faster to reinstall and re-synchronize in the case of failure. However, this method requires significant disk space and could take a long time to perform the backup. If you want to back up only the required files and directories, use the following list. To make this process simpler, and more comprehensive, we recommend backing up the entire /etc and /root directories, not just the ones specified here. Some files only exist if you are actually using the related SUSE Manager feature. /etc/cobbler/ /etc/dhcp.conf /etc/fstab and any ISO mount points you require. If your UUID has changed, ensure you have updated the fstab entries accordingly. /etc/rhn/ /etc/salt /etc/sudoers /etc/sysconfig/rhn/ /root/.gnupg/ /root/.ssh This file exists if you are using an SSH tunnel or SSH push. You also need to have saved a copy of the id-susemanager key. /root/ssl-build/ /srv/formula_metadata /srv/pillar /srv/salt /srv/susemanager /srv/tftpboot/ /srv/www/cobbler /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ /srv/www/os-images /var/cache/rhn /var/cache/salt /var/lib/cobbler/ /var/lib/cobbler/templates/ (before version 4.0 it is /var/lib/rhn/kickstarts/) /var/lib/Kiwi /var/lib/rhn/ /var/run/pgsql/ /var/lib/salt/ /var/run/salt/ /var/spacewalk/ Any directories containing custom data such as scripts, Kickstart or AutoYaST profiles, and custom RPMs. You also need to back up your database, which you can do with the smdba tool. Procedure: Restoring from a Manual Backup Re-install the Uyuni Server. For more information, see Install Uyuni 2024.01 Server. Set up the Uyuni Server with yast2 susemanager_setup. For more information, see SUSE Manager Server Setup. Re-synchronize your Uyuni repositories using either the Uyuni Web UI, or with the mgr-sync tool at the command prompt. You can choose to re-register your product, or skip the registration and SSL certificate generation sections. Re-install the /root/ssl-build/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-MACHINE_NAME-VER-REL.noarch.rpm package. Schedule the re-creation of search indexes next time the rhn-search service is started. This command produces only debug messages, it does not produce error messages: rhn-search cleanindex Check whether you need to restore /var/spacewalk/packages/. If /var/spacewalk/packages/ was not in your backup, you need to restore it. If the source repository is available, you can restore /var/spacewalk/packages/ with a complete channel synchronization: mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels The smdba tool is used for managing a local PostgreSQL database. It allows you to back up and restore your database, and manage backups. It can also be used to check the status of your database, and perform administration tasks, such as restarting. For more information about the smdba tool, see [reference:cli-smdba]. The smdba tool works with local PostgreSQL databases only, it does not work with remotely accessed databases, or Oracle databases. The smdba tool requires sudo access, to execute system changes. Ensure you have enabled sudo access for the admin user before you begin, by checking the /etc/sudoers file for this line: admin ALL=(postgres) /usr/bin/smdba Check the runtime status of your database with: smdba db-status This command returns either online or offline, for example: Checking database core... online Starting and stopping the database can be performed with: smdba db-start And: smdba db-stop The smdba tool performs a continuous archiving backup. This backup method combines a log of every change made to the database during the current session, with a series of more traditional backup files. When a crash occurs, the database state is first restored from the most recent backup file on disk, then the log of the current session is replayed exactly, to bring the database back to a current state. A continuous archiving backup with smdba is performed with the database running, so there is no need for downtime. This method of backing up is stable and generally creates consistent snapshots, however it can take up a lot of storage space. Ensure you have at least three times the current database size of space available for backups. You can check your current database size by navigating to /var/lib/pgsql/ and running df -h. The smdba tool also manages your archives, keeping only the most recent backup, and the current archive of logs. The log files can only be a maximum file size of 16 MB, so a new log file is created when the files reach this size. Every time you create a new backup, previous backups are purged to release disk space. We recommend you use cron to schedule your smdba backups to ensure that your storage is managed effectively, and you always have a backup ready in case of failure. The smdba tool can be run directly from the command line. We recommend you run a manual database backup immediately after installation, or if you have made any significant changes to your configuration. When smdba is run for the first time, or if you have changed the location of the backup, it needs to restart your database before performing the archive. This results in a small amount of downtime. Regular database backups do not require any downtime. Procedure: Performing a Manual Database Backup Allocate permanent storage space for your backup. This example uses a directory located at /var/spacewalk/. This becomes a permanent target for your backup, so ensure it remains accessible by your server at all times. In your backup location, create a directory for the backup: As root: install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup Ensure you have the correct permissions set on the backup location: chown postgres:postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup To create a backup for the first time, run the smdba backup-hot command with the enable option set. This creates the backup in the specified directory, and, if necessary, restart the database: smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup This command produces debug messages and finishes sucessfully with the output: INFO: Finished Check that the backup files exist in the /var/spacewalk/db-backup directory, to ensure that your backup has been successful. You do not need to shut down your system to perform a database backup with smdba. However, because it is a large operation, database performance can slow down while the backup is running. We recommend you schedule regular database backups for a low-traffic period, to minimize disruption. Ensure you have at least three times the current database size of space available for backups. You can check your current database size by navigating to /var/lib/pgsql/ and running df -h. Procedure: Scheduling Automatic Backups Create a directory for the backup, and set the appropriate permissions (as root): install -d -m 700 -o postgres -g postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup Open /etc/cron.d/db-backup-mgr, or create it if it does not exist, and add the following line to create the cron job: 0 2 * * * root /usr/bin/smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup Check the backup directory regularly to ensure the backups are working as expected. The smdba tool can be used to restore from backup in the case of failure. Procedure: Restoring from Backup Shut down the database: smdba db-stop Start the restore process and wait for it to complete: smdba backup-restore start Restart the database: smdba db-start Check if there are differences between the RPMs and the database. spacewalk-data-fsck Archive logging allows the database management tool smdba to perform hot backups. In Uyuni with an embedded database, archive logging is enabled by default. PostgreSQL maintains a limited number of archive logs. Using the default configuration, approximately 64 files with a size of 16 MiB are stored. Creating a user and syncing the channels: SLES12-SP2-Pool-x86_64 SLES12-SP2-Updates-x86_64 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool-x86_64-SP2 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates-x86_64-SP2 PostgreSQL generates an additional roughly 1 GB of data. So it is important to think about a backup strategy and create a backups in a regular way. Archive logs are stored at /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog/ (postgresql). Database administrators may use the subcommand space-overview to get a report about occupied table spaces, for example: smdba space-overview outputs: SUSE Manager Database Control.

It is possible to move the database to another location. For example, if database storage space is running low. Procedure: Moving the Database The default storage location for Uyuni is /var/lib/pgsql/. If you would like to move it, for example to /storage/postgres/, proceed as follows. At the command prompt, as root, stop the running database: rcpostgresql stop Shut down the running spacewalk services: spacewalk-service stop Copy the current working directory structure with cp using the -a, --archive option. For example: cp --archive /var/lib/pgsql/ /storage/postgres/ This command copies the contents of /var/lib/pgsql/ to /storage/postgres/pgsql/. The contents of the /var/lib/pgsql directory needs to remain the same, otherwise the Uyuni database may malfunction. You also should ensure that there is enough available disk space. Mount the new database directory: mount /storage/postgres/pgsql Make sure ownership is postgres:postgres and not root:root by changing to the new directory and running these commands: cd /storage/postgres/pgsql/ ls -l Outputs: total 8 drwxr-x--- 4 postgres postgres 47 Jun 2 14:35 ./ Add the new database mount location to your servers fstab by editing etc/fstab. Start the database with: rcpostgresql start Start the spacewalk services: spacewalk-service start If your root partition has crashed, you can restart the Uyuni Server with some additional steps. This section assumes you have setup your server using separate partitions for the database and for channels, mounted at /var/lib/pgsql and /var/spacewalk/. After a new installation of a system most users and groups get different IDs. Most backup systems store the names instead of the IDs and will restore the files with the correct ownership and permissions. But if you mount existing partitions, you must align the ownership to the new system. Procedure: Recovering from a Crashed Root Partition Install Uyuni. Do not mount the /var/spacewalk and /var/lib/pgsql partitions. Wait for the installation to complete before going on to the next step. Shut down the database: rcpostgresql stop Shut down the services: spacewalk-service stop Mount /var/spacewalk and /var/lib/pgsql partitions. Restore the directories listed in Back up Uyuni. Start the database: rcpostgresql start Start the spacewalk services: spacewalk-service start Uyuni should now operate normally without loss of your database or synchronized channels. You can set information for connecting to the Uyuni database by adding or editing these variable in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: db_backend = postgresql db_user = susemanager db_password = susemanager db_name = susemanager db_host = localhost db_port = 5432 db_ssl_enabled =","title":"Backup and Restore","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"backup-restore","url":"/uyuni/administration/backup-restore.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Delete channels Channels are a method of grouping software packages. In Uyuni, channels are grouped into base and child channels, with base channels grouped by operating system type, version, and architecture, and child channels being compatible with their related base channel. When a client has been assigned to a base channel, it is only possible for that system to install the related child channels. Organizing channels in this way ensures that only compatible packages are installed on each system. Software channels use repositories to provide packages. The channels mirror the repositories in Uyuni, and the package names and other data are stored in the Uyuni database. You can have any number of repositories associated with a channel. The software from those repositories can then be installed on clients by subscribing the client to the appropriate channel. Clients can only be assigned to one base channel. The client can then install or update packages from the repositories associated with that base channel and any of its child channels. Uyuni provides a number of vendor channels, which provide you everything you need to run Uyuni. Uyuni Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority, which gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels. If you want to use your own packages in your environment, you can create custom channels. Custom channels can be used as a base channel, or you can associate them with a vendor base channel. For more on creating custom channels, see Custom Channels. By default, any user can subscribe channels to a system. You can implement restrictions on the channel using the Web UI. Procedure: Restricting subscriber access to a channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Channel List, and select the channel to edit. Locate the Per-User Subscription Restrictions section and check Only selected users within your organization may subscribe to this channel. Click Update to save the changes. Navigate to the Subscribers tab and select or deselect users as required. You can delete vendor software channels from the command prompt. Procedure: Deleting vendor channels On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, list the available vendor channels, and make a note of the channel you want to delete: mgr-sync list channels Delete the channel: spacewalk-remove-channel -c For more information about deleting channels manually, see Removing channel.

AppStream Filters This section contains some common examples of how you can use content lifecycle management. Use these examples to build your own personalized implementation. An example project for a monthly patch cycle consists of: Creating a By Date filter Adding the filter to the project Applying the filter to a new project build Excluding a patch from the project Including a patch in the project The By Date filter excludes all patches released after a specified date. This filter is useful for your content lifecycle projects that follow a monthly patch cycle. Procedure: Creating the By Date Filter In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, type a name for your filter. For example, Exclude patches by date. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Issue date). In the Matcher field, later or equal is autoselected. Select the date and time. Click Save. Procedure: Adding a Filter to a Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select a project from the list. Click Attach/Detach Filters link to see all available filters Select the new Exclude patches by date filter. Click Save. The new filter is added to your filter list, but it still needs to be applied to the project. To apply the filter you need to build the first environment. Procedure: Using the Filter Click Build to build the first environment. OPTIONAL: Add a message. You can use messages to help track the build history. Check that the filter has worked correctly by using the new channels on a test server. Click Promote to move the content to the next environment. The build takes longer if you have a large number of filters, or they are very complex. Tests may help you discover issues. When an issue is found, exclude the problem patch released before the by date filter. Procedure: Excluding a Patch In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, enter a name for the filter. For example, Exclude openjdk patch. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Advisory Name). In the Matcher field, select equals. In the Advisory Name field, type a name for the advisory. For example, SUSE-15-2019-1807. Click Save. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters link, select Exclude openjdk patch, and click Save. When you rebuild the project with the Build button, the new filter is used together with the by date filter we added before. In this example, you have received a security alert. An important security patch was released several days after the first of the month you are currently working on. The name of the new patch is SUSE-15-2019-2071. You need to include this new patch into your environment. The Allow filters rule overrides the exclude function of the Deny filter rule. For more information, see Content Lifecycle Management. Procedure: Including a Patch in a Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, type a name for the filter. For example, Include kernel security fix. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Advisory Name). In the Matcher field, select equals. In the Advisory Name field, type SUSE-15-2019-2071, and check Allow. Click Save to store the filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project from the list. Click Attach/Detach Filters, and select Include kernel security patch. Click Save. Click Build to rebuild the environment. When a monthly patch cycle is complete, you can update the patch cycle for the next month. Procedure: Updating a Monthly Patch Cycle In the by date field, change the date of the filter to the next month. Alternatively, create a new filter and change the assignment to the project. Check if the exclude filter for SUSE-15-2019-1807 can be detached from the project. There may be a new patch available to fix this issue. Detach the allow filter you added previously. The patch is included by default. Rebuild the project to create a new environment with patches for the next month. This section covers setting up filters to create environments for live patching. When you are preparing to use live patching, there are some important considerations Only ever use one kernel version on your systems. The live patching packages are installed with a specific kernel. Live patching updates are shipped as one patch. Each kernel patch that begins a new series of live patching kernels displays the required reboot flag. These kernel patches come with live patching tools. When you have installed them, you need to reboot the system at least once before the next year. Only install live patch updates that match the installed kernel version. Live patches are provided as stand-alone patches. You must exclude all regular kernel patches with higher kernel version than the currently installed one. In this example you update your systems with the SUSE-15-2019-1244 patch. This patch contains kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64. You need to exclude all patches which contain a higher version of kernel-default. Procedure: Excluding Packages with a Higher Kernel Version In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters, and click Create Filter. In the Filter Name field, type a name for your filter. For example, Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1. In the Filter Type field, select Patch (Contains Package). In the Matcher field, select version greater than. In the Package Name field, type kernel-default. Leave the the Epoch field empty. In the Version field, type 4.12.14. In the Release field, type 150.17.1. Click Save to store the filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters. Select Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1, and click Save. When you click Build, a new environment is created. The new environment contains all the kernel patches up to the version you installed. All kernel patches with higher kernel versions are removed. Live patching kernels remain available as long as they are not the first in a series. This procedure can be automated using a filter template. For more information on how to apply a live patching filter template, see administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templates. Live Patching for a specific kernel version is only available for one year. After one year you must update the kernel on your systems. Execute these environment changes: Procedure: Switch to a New Kernel Version Decide which kernel version to upgrade to. For example: 4.12.14-150.32.1 Create a new kernel version Filter. Detach the previous filter Exclude kernel greater than 4.12.14-150.17.1 and attach the new filter. Click Build to rebuild the environment. The new environment contains all kernel patches up to the new kernel version you selected. Systems using these channels have the kernel update available for installation. You need to reboot systems after they have performed the upgrade. The new kernel remains valid for one year. All packages installed during the year match the current live patching kernel filter. If you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 clients, you cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories like the Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream repository. You can use the AppStream filter to transform modular repositories into regular repositories. It does this by keeping the packages in the repository and stripping away the module metadata. The resulting repository can be used in Uyuni in the same way as a regular repository. The AppStream filter selects a single module stream to be included in the target repository. You can add multiple filters to select multiple module streams. If you do not use an AppStream filter in your CLM project, the module metadata in the modular sources remains intact, and the target repositories contain the same module metadata. As long as at least one AppStream filter is enabled in the CLM project, all target repositories are transformed into regular repositories. In some cases, you might wish to build regular repositories without having to include packages from any module. To do so, add an AppStream filter using the matcher none (disable modularity). This will disable all the modules in the target repository. This is especially useful for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 clients, where the default versions of most modules are already included in the AppStream repository as regular packages. To use the AppStream filter, you need a CLM project with a modular repository such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream. Ensure that you included the module you need as a source before you begin. Procedure: Using AppStream Filters In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLM project. Ensure that you have included the AppStream channels for your project. Click btn:Create Filter and use these parameters: In the Filter Name field, type a name for the new filter. In the Filter Type field, select Module (Stream). In the Matcher field, select equals. In the Module Name field, type a module name. For example, postgresql. In the Stream field, type the name of the desired stream. For example, 10. If you leave this field blank, the default stream for the module is selected. Click Save to create the new filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click btn:Attach/Detach Filters, select your new AppStream filter, and click Save. You can use the browse function in the Create/Edit Filter form to select a module from a list of available module streams for a modular channel. Procedure: Browsing Available Module Streams In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLM project. Ensure that you have included the AppStream channels for your project. Click btn:Create Filter and use these parameters: In the Filter Name field, type a name for the new filter. In the Filter Type field, select Module (Stream). In the Matcher field, select equals. Click Browse available modules to see all modular channels. Select a channel to browse the modules and streams: In the Module Name field, start typing a module name to search, or select from the list. In the Stream field, start typing a stream name to search, or select from the list. Channel selection is only for browsing modules. The selected channel is not be saved with the filter, and does not affect the CLM process in any way. You can create additional AppStream filters for any other module stream to be included in the target repository. Any module streams that the selected stream depends on is automatically included. Be careful not to specify conflicting, incompatible, or missing module streams. For example, selecting two streams from the same module is invalid. Procedure: Disabling Modularity In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 CLM project. Ensure that you have included the AppStream channels for your project. Click btn:Create Filter and use these parameters: In the Filter Name field, type a name for the new filter. In the Filter Type field, select Module (Stream). In the Matcher field, select none (disable modularity). Click Save to create the new filter. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click btn:Attach/Detach Filters, select your new AppStream filter, and click Save. This will effectively remove the module metadata from the target repository, excluding any package that belongs to a module. When you build your CLM project using the Build button in the Web UI, the target repository is a regular repository without any modules, that contains packages from the selected module streams. Disabling modularity altogether in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 projects might result in a faulty environment as some modules are essential for healthy operation in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.","title":"Content Lifecycle Management Examples","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Filter Templates 3.1. Live patching based on a SUSE product 3.2. Live patching based on a system 3.3. AppStream modules with defaults 4. Build a Content Lifecycle Project 5. Promote Environments 6. Assign Clients to Environments Content lifecycle management allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. This is especially useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. While you cannot directly modify vendor channels, you can clone them and then modify the clones by adding or removing packages and custom patches. You can assign these cloned channels to test clients to ensure they work as expected. By default, cloned vendor channels match the original vendor channel and automatically select the dependencies. You can disable the automatic selection for cloned channels by adding the following option in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: java.cloned_channel_auto_selection = false Then, when all tests pass, you can promote the cloned channels to production servers. This is achieved through a series of environments that your software channels can move through on their lifecycle. Most environment lifecycles include at least test and production environments, but you can have as many environments as you require. This section covers the basic content lifecycle procedures, and the filters available. For more specific examples, see Content Lifecycle Management Examples. To set up a content lifecycle, you need to begin with a project. The project defines the software channel sources, the filters used to find packages, and the build environments. Procedure: Creating a Content Lifecycle Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and click Create Project. In the Label field, enter a label for your project. The Label field only accepts lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores. In the Name field, enter a descriptive name for your project. Click the Create button to create your project and return to the project page. Click Attach/Detach Sources. In the Sources dialog, select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. The software channels you selected should now be showing. Click Attach/Detach Filters. In the Filters dialog, select the filters you want to attach to the project. To create a new filter, click Create new Filter. Click Add Environment. In the Environment Lifecycle dialog, give the first environment a name, a label, and a description, and click Save. The Label field only accepts lowercase letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores. Continue creating environments until you have all the environments for your lifecycle completed. You can select the order of the environments in the lifecycle by selecting an environment in the Insert before field when you create it. Uyuni allows you to create various types of filters to control the content used for building the project. Filters allow you to select which packages are included or excluded from the build. For example, you could exclude all kernel packages, or include only specific releases of some packages. The supported filters are: package filtering by name by name, epoch, version, release, and architecture by provided name patch filtering by advisory name by advisory type by synopsis by keyword by date by affected package module by stream Package dependencies are not resolved during content filtering. There are multiple matchers you can use with the filter. Which ones are available depends on the filter type you choose. The available matchers are: contains matches (must take the form of a regular expression) equals greater greater or equal lower or equal lower later or equal Each filter has a rule parameter that can be set to either Allow or Deny. The filters are processed like this: If a package or patch satisfies a Deny filter, it is excluded from the result. If a package or patch satisfies an Allow filter, it is included in the result (even if it was excluded by a Deny filter). This behavior is useful when you want to exclude large number of packages or patches using a general Deny filter and \"cherry-pick\" specific packages or patches with specific Allow filters. Content filters are global in your organization and can be shared between projects. If your project already contains built sources, when you add an environment it is automatically populated with the existing content. Content is drawn from the previous environment of the cycle if it had one. If there is no previous environment, it is left empty until the project sources are built again. To help with creating filters for some common scenarios, Uyuni offers filter templates. When applied, these templates help creating a set of filters in advance, tailored for a specific use case. This section describes available templates and their usages. In a project that contains live patching, regular future kernel packages must be excluded so that only live patch packages are offered as updates to clients. On the other hand, already installed regular kernel packages must still be included to keep system integrity. When applied, this template creates three filters required to achieve this behavior: Allow patches that contain kernel-default package equal to a base kernel version Deny patches that contain reboot_suggested keyword Deny patches that contain a package which provides the name installhint(reboot-needed) For more information on how to set up a live patching project, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version. Procedure: Applying the template In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters, and click Create Filter. In the dialog, click Use a template. The inputs will change accordingly. In the Prefix field, type a name prefix. This value will be prepended to the name of every individual filter created by the template. If the template is being applied in the context of a project, this field will be prefilled with the project label. In the Template field, select Live patching based on a SUSE product. In the Product field, select the product you wish to set up live patching for. In the Kernel field, select a kernel version from the list of versions available in the selected product. The filter to deny the later regular kernel patches will be based on this version. Click Save to create the filters. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters. Select the three filters that have the specified prefix, and click Save. When you want to set up a live patching project based on a kernel version installed in a specific registered system, you can use the \"live patching based on a system\" template. When applied, this template creates three filters required to achieve this behavior: Allow patches that contain kernel-default package equal to a base kernel version Deny patches that contain reboot_suggested keyword Deny patches that contain a package which provides the name installhint(reboot-needed) For more information on how to set up a live patching project, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version. Procedure: Applying the template In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Filters, and click Create Filter. In the dialog, click Use a template. The inputs will change accordingly. In the Prefix field, type a name prefix. This value will be prepended to the name of every filter created by the template. If the template is being applied in the context of a project, this field will be prefilled with the project label. In the Template field, select Live patching based on a specific system. In the System field, select a system from the list, or start typing a system name to narrow down the options. In the Kernel field, select a kernel version from the list of versions installed in the selected system. The filter to deny the later regular kernel patches will be based on this version. Click Save to create the filters. Navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects and select your project. Click Attach/Detach Filters. Select the three filters that have the specified prefix, and click Save. When you want to have all the modules available in a modular repository included in your project, you can automatically add them using this filter template. When applied, this template creates an AppStream filter per module and its default stream. If this process is done from the project’s page, the filters are added to the project automatically. Otherwise, the created filters can be listed in Content Lifecycle Filters and be added to any project as needed. Each individual filter can be edited to select a different module stream, or removed altogether to exclude that module from the target repositories. Because not all module streams are compatible with each other, changing individual streams may prevent successful resolution of modular dependencies. When this happens, the filters pane in the project details page will show an error describing the problem, and the build button will be disabled until all the module selections are compatible. Since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, modules do not have any defined default streams. Therefore, using this template with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 sources will have no effect. For more information on how to set up AppStream repositories with content lifecycle management, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters. Procedure: Applying the template In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select your project. In the Filters section, click Attach/Detach Filters, and then click Create New Filter. In the dialog, click Use a template. The inputs will change accordingly. In the Prefix field, type a name prefix. This value will be prepended to the name of every filter created by the template. If the template is being applied in the context of a project, this field will be prefilled with the project label. In the Template field, select AppStream modules with defaults. In the Channel field, select a modular channel to get the modules from. In this dropdown, only the modular channels are displayed. Click Save to create the filters. Scroll to the Filters section to see the newly attached AppStream filters. You can edit/remove any individual filter to tailor the project to your needs. When you have created your project, defined environments, and attached sources and filters, you can build the project for the first time. Building applies filters to the attached sources and clones them to the first environment in the project. You can use the same vendor channels as sources for multiple content projects. In this case, Uyuni does not create new patch clones for each cloned channel. Instead, a single patch clone is shared between all of your cloned channels. This can cause problems if a vendor modifies a patch; for example, if the patch is retracted, or the packages within the patch are changed. When you build one of the content projects, all the channels that share the cloned patch are synchronized with the original by default, even if the channels are in other environments of your content project, or other content project channels in your organization. You can change this behavior by turning off automatic patch synchronization in your organization settings. To manually synchronize the patch later for all channels sharing the patch, navigate to Software Manage Channels, click the channel you want to synchronize and navigate to the Sync subtab. Even manual patch synchronization affects all organization channels sharing the patch. Procedure: Building a Content Lifecycle Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to build. Make sure you have the environment available before building the project. Review the attached sources and filters, and click Build. Provide a version message to describe the changes or updates in this build. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section. After the build is finished, the environment version is increased by one and the built sources, such as software channels, can be assigned to your clients. When the project has been built, the built sources can be sequentially promoted to the environments. Procedure: Promoting Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section. When you build and promote content lifecycle projects, Uyuni creates a tree of software channels. To add clients to the environment, assign the base and child software channels to your client using Software Software Channels in the System Details page for the client. Newly added cloned channels are not assigned to clients automatically. If you add or promote sources you need to manually check and update your channel assignments. Automatic assignment is intended to be added to Uyuni in a future version.","title":"Content Lifecycle Management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure Content Staging Staging is used by clients to download packages in advance, before they are installed. This allows package installation to begin as soon as it is scheduled, which can reduce the amount of time required for a maintenance window. You can manage content staging across your entire organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations to see a list of available organizations. Click the name of an organization, and check the Enable Staging Contents box to allow clients in this organization to stage package data. You must be logged in as the Uyuni administrator to create and manage organizations. You can also enable staging at the command prompt by editing /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date, and adding or editing these lines: stagingContent=1 stagingContentWindow=24 The stagingContentWindow parameter is a time value expressed in hours and determines when downloading starts. It is the number of hours before the scheduled installation or update time. In this example, content is downloaded 24 hours before the installation time. The start time for download depends on the selected contact method for a system. The assigned contact method sets the time for when the next mgr_check is executed. Next time an action is scheduled, packages are automatically downloaded, but not installed. At the scheduled time, the staged packages are installed. There are two parameters used to configure content staging: salt_content_staging_advance is the advance time for the content staging window to open, in hours. This is the number of hours before installation starts, that package downloads can begin. salt_content_staging_window is the duration of the content staging window, in hours. This is the amount of time clients have to stage packages before installation begins. For example, if salt_content_staging_advance is set to six hours, and salt_content_staging_window is set to two hours, the staging window opens six hours before the installation time, and remain open for two hours. No packages are downloaded in the four remaining hours until installation starts. If you set the same value for both salt_content_staging_advance and salt_content_staging_window packages are able to be downloaded until installation begins. Configure the content staging parameters in /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java.conf. Default values: salt_content_staging_advance: 8 hours salt_content_staging_window: 8 hours Content staging must be enabled for these parameters to work correctly.","title":"Content Staging","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-staging","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-staging.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Creating Custom Channels and Repositories 2. Custom channel synchronization 3. Add Packages and Patches to Custom Channels 4. Manage Custom Channels Custom channels give you the ability to create your own software packages and repositories, which you can use to update your clients. They also allow you to use software provided by third party vendors in your environment. This section gives more detail on how to create, administer, and delete custom channels. You must have administrator privileges to be able to create and manage custom channels. Before you create a custom channel, determine which base channel you want to associate it with, and which repositories you want to use for content. If you have custom software packages that you need to install on your client systems, you can create a custom child channel to manage them. You need to create the channel in the Uyuni Web UI and create a repository for the packages, before assigning the channel to your systems. Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system. You can select a vendor channel as the base channel if you want to use packages provided by a vendor. Alternatively, select none to make your custom channel a base channel. Procedure: Creating a Custom Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and click Create Channel. On the Create Software Channel page, give your channel a name (for example, My Tools SLES 15 SP1 x86_64) and a label (for example, my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64). Labels must not contain spaces or uppercase letters. In the Parent Channel drop down, choose the relevant base channel (for example, SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64). Ensure that you choose the compatible parent channel for your packages. In the Architecture drop down, choose the appropriate hardware architecture (for example, x86_64). Provide any additional information in the contact details, channel access control, and GPG fields, as required for your environment. Click Create Channel. Custom channels sometimes require additional security settings. Many third party vendors secure packages with GPG. If you want to use GPG-protected packages in your custom channel, you need to trust the GPG key which has been used to sign the metadata. You can then check the Has Signed Metadata? check box to match the package metadata against the trusted GPG keys. If remote channels and repositories are signed with GPG keys, you can import and trust these GPG keys. For example, execute the spacewalk-repo-sync from the command line on the Uyuni Server: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync -c -t yum The underlying zypper call will import the key, if it is available. The Web UI does not offer this feature. This only works when the repository you want to mirror is set up in a special way and provide the \"key\" in the repository next to the signature. This is the case for all repositories generated by the Open Build Service (OBS). For other repositories special preparation steps are needed (see below!). By default, the Enable GPG Check field is checked when you create a new channel. If you would like to add custom packages and applications to your channel, make sure you uncheck this field to be able to install unsigned packages. Disabling the GPG check is a security risk if packages are from an untrusted source. You can only add a repository to the Uyuni with the Web UI if it is a valid software repository. Check in advance that needed repository metadata are available. Tools such as createrepo and reprepro are useful in this regard. mgrpush can help with pushing a single RPM into a channel without creating a repository. For more information, see the man pages for createrepo_c and reprepro. Procedure: Adding a Software Repository In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Repositories, and click Create Repository. On the Create Repository page, give your repository a label (for example, my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo). In the Repository URL field, provide the path to the directory that contains the repodata file (for example, file:///opt/mytools/). You can use any valid addressing protocol in this field. Uncheck the Has Signed Metadata? check box. OPTIONAL: Complete the SSL fields if your repository requires client certificate authentication. Click Create Repository. The above procedure only works if the repository you want to mirror provides the \"key\" in the repository next to the signature. This is the case for all repositories generated by the OBS, but it is typically not the case for other repos of operating systems that are not offered by the OBS. If the repository you want to use does not have a GPG key you can provide one yourself and import the GPG key into the keyring manually. If you import the key into the /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir keyring using the gpg commandline tool it would be stored permanently. The key would also persist if the chroot environment would be cleaned. Procedure: Creating a Software Repository with GPG Key The gpg command to import a key into the pub keyring is: gpg --keyring /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --import /path/to/gpg.key gpg --edit-key Add Debian non-flat repositories using uyuni_suite, uyuni_component, and uyuni_arch query parameters. uyuni_suite is mandatory. In Debian documentation, this is also known as distribution. With this parameter you specify the apt source. Without this parameter the original approach is used. If the parameter ends with /, the repository is identified as flat. uyuni_component is optional. This parameter can specify only one component. It is not possible to list the components. An apt source entry allows to specify multiple components, but for Uyuni it is not possible. Instead you must create separate repository for each component. uyuni_arch is optional. If omitted the architecture name is calculated with a SQL query for the channel from the database. Specify uyuni_arch explicitly if it does not match the architecture of the channel (sometimes architecture naming is ambiguous). Here are some examples: Table 1. Debian non-flat repository mapping Type Source line / URL apt source line deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ URL mapping https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable?uyuni_suite=binary/ apt source line deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main URL mapping https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists?uyuni_suite=stable&uyuni_component=main Find here background information about the Debian repository definition format. This information is based on https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Overview. The repository definition format is as follows: deb uri suite [component1] [component2] [...] For example: deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main or deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ For each pair of suite and component the spezification defines a distinct URL calculated on the base URL + suite + component. Procedure: Assigning the Repository to a Channel Assign your new repository to your custom channel by navigating to Software Manage Channels, clicking the name of your newly created custom channel, and navigating to the Repositories tab. Ensure the repository you want to assign to the channel is checked, and click Update Repositories. By default, the synchronization process starts immediately. For more information about channel synchronization, see below. Procedure: Adding Custom Channels to an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and select the key you want to add the custom channel to. On the Details tab, in the Child Channels listing, select the channel to associate. You can select multiple channels, if you need to. Click Update Activation Key. To avoid missing important updates, SUSE recommends to keep your custom channels up to date with the remote repositories changes. By default, a synchronization will happen automatically for all custom channels you create. In particular, it will happen: after adding a repository to a channel from the UI or by using spacewalk-common-channels as part of the daily task mgr-sync-refresh-default, which will synchronize all your custom and vendor channels. To disable this default behaviour, set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: java.unify_custom_channel_management = 0 With this property turned off, no synchronization is performed automatically and, in order to keep a custom channel up to date, you need to: synchronize it manually by navigating to the Sync tab and click Sync Now, set up an automated synchronization schedule from the Repositories tab. When the process is started, there are several ways to check if a channel has finished synchronizing: In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and select the Products tab. This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the menu:[Repositories > Sync] tab. The Sync Status is shown next to the repository name.. Check the synchronization log file at the command prompt: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. When you create a new custom channel without cloning it from an existing channel, it does not contain any packages or patches. You can add the packages and patches you require using the Uyuni Web UI. Custom channels can only include packages or patches that are cloned or custom, and they must match the base architecture of the channel. Patches added to custom channels must apply to a package that exists in the channel. Procedure: Adding Packages to Custom Channels In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and go to the Packages tab. OPTIONAL: See all packages currently in the channel by navigating to the List/Remove tab. Add new packages to the channel by navigating to the Add tab. Select the parent channel to provide packages, and click View Packages to populate the list. Check the packages to add to the custom channel, and click Add Packages. When you are satisfied with the selection, click Confirm Addition to add the packages to the channel. OPTIONAL: You can compare the packages in the current channel with those in a different channel by navigating to Software Manage Channels, and going to the Packages Compare tab. To make the two channels the same, click the Merge Differences button, and resolve any conflicts. Procedure: Adding Patches to a Custom Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and go to the Patches tab. OPTIONAL: See all patches currently in the channel by navigating to the List/Remove tab. Add new patches to the channel by navigating to the Add tab, and selecting what kind of patches you want to add. Select the parent channel to provide patches, and click View Associated Patches to populate the list. Check the patches to add to the custom channel, and click Confirm. When you are satisfied with the selection, click Confirm to add the patches to the channel. Uyuni administrators and channel administrators can alter or delete any channel. To grant other users rights to alter or delete a channel, navigate to Software Manage Channels and select the channel you want to edit. Navigate to the Managers tab, and check the user to grant permissions. Click Update to save the changes. If you delete a channel that has been assigned to a set of clients, it triggers an immediate update of the channel state for any clients associated with the deleted channel. This is to ensure that the changes are reflected accurately in the repository file. You cannot delete Uyuni channels with the Web UI. Only custom channels can be deleted. Procedure: Deleting Custom Channels In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and select the channel you want to delete. Click Delete software channel. On the Delete Channel page, check the details of the channel you are deleting, and check the Unsubscribe Systems checkbox to remove the custom channel from any systems that might still be subscribed. Click Delete Channel. When channels are deleted, the packages that are part of the deleted channel are not automatically removed. You are not able to update packages that have had their channel deleted. You can delete packages that are not associated with a channel in the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Software Manage Packages, check the packages to remove, and click Delete Packages.","title":"Custom Channels","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"custom-channels","url":"/uyuni/administration/custom-channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Synchronize a Disconnected Server When it is not possible to connect Uyuni to the internet, you can use it within a disconnected environment. The repository mirroring tool (RMT) is available on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 and later. RMT replaces the subscription management tool (SMT), which can be used on older SUSE Linux Enterprise installations. In a disconnected Uyuni setup, RMT or SMT uses an external network to connect to SUSE Customer Center. All software channels and repositories are synchronized to a removable storage device. The storage device can then be used to update the disconnected Uyuni installation. This setup allows your Uyuni installation to remain in an offline, disconnected environment. Your RMT or SMT instance must be used to manage the Uyuni Server directly. It cannot be used to manage a second RMT or SMT instance, in a cascade. For more information on RMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-rmt.html. You can use RMT on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 installations to manage clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 or later. We recommend you set up a dedicated RMT instance for each Uyuni installation. Procedure: Setting up RMT On the RMT instance, install the RMT package: zypper in rmt-server Configure RMT using YaST: yast2 rmt Follow the prompts to complete installation. For more information on setting up RMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-rmt.html. Procedure: Synchronizing RMT with SCC On the RMT instance, list all available products and repositories for your organization: rmt-cli products list --all rmt-cli repos list --all Synchronize all available updates for your organization: rmt-cli sync You can also configure RMT to synchronize regularly using systemd. Enable the products you require. For example, to enable SLES 15: rmt-cli product enable sles/15/x86_64 Export the synchronized data to your removable storage. In this example, the storage medium is mounted at /mnt/usb: rmt-cli export data /mnt/usb Export the enabled repositories to your removable storage: rmt-cli export settings /mnt/usb rmt-cli export repos /mnt/usb Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user. You can change RMT user settings in the cli section of /etc/rmt.conf. SMT is included with SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, and can be used to manage clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 or later. SMT requires you to create a local mirror directory on the SMT instance to synchronize repositories and packages. For more details on installing and configuring SMT, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/book-smt.html. Procedure: Synchronizing SMT with SCC On the SMT instance, create a database replacement file: smt-sync --createdbreplacementfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml Export the synchronized data to your removable storage. In this example, the storage medium is mounted at /mnt/usb: smt-sync --todir /mnt/usb smt-mirror --dbreplfile /tmp/dbrepl.xml --directory /mnt/usb \\ --fromlocalsmt -L /var/log/smt/smt-mirror-export.log curl https://scc.suse.com/suma/product_tree.json -o /mnt/usb/product_tree.json Ensure that the external storage is mounted to a directory that is writeable by the RMT user. You can change SMT user settings in /etc/smt.conf. The corresponding Uyuni Client Tools Channels are required, for Uyuni to be able to synchronize a given channel. If these channels are not enabled, Uyuni may fail to detect that product. Run the following command to enable these mandatory channels: SLES 12 and products based on it such as SLES for SAP or SLE HPC RMT: rmt-cli products enable sle-manager-tools/12/x86_64 SMT: smt repos -p sle-manager-tools,12,x86_64 SLES 15 and products based on it such as SLES for SAP or SLE HPC RMT: rmt-cli products enable sle-manager-tools/15/x86_64 SMT: smt repos -p sle-manager-tools,15,x86_64 Then mirror the channels, and export. Other distributions, or architectures, can be enabled. For more information about enabling product channels or repositories to be mirrored, see the documentation: RMT https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-rmt-mirroring.html#sec-rmt-mirroring-enable-disable SMT https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/single-html/SLES-smt/index.html#smt-mirroring-manage-domirror When you have removable media loaded with your SUSE Customer Center data, you can use it to synchronize your disconnected server. Procedure: Synchronizing a Disconnected Server Mount your removable media device to the Uyuni server. In this example, the mount point is /media/disk. Open /etc/rhn/rhn.conf and define the mount point by adding or editing this line: server.susemanager.fromdir = /media/disk Restart the Tomcat service: systemctl restart tomcat Refresh the local data: mgr-sync refresh Perform a synchronization: mgr-sync list channels mgr-sync add channel channel-label The removable disk that you use for synchronization must always be available at the same mount point. Do not trigger a synchronization, if the storage medium is not mounted. This results in data corruption. Be aware that if server.susemanager.fromdir is set, Uyuni will not be able to check if SUSE Customer Center credentials are valid or not. Instead, a warning sign will be displayed and no SCC online check will be performed.","title":"Disconnected Setup","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"disconnected-setup","url":"/uyuni/administration/disconnected-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Example of Kiwi sources 3.6. Build an image 3.7. Troubleshooting 3.8. Limitations 4. List of built images Uyuni enables system administrators to build containers and OS Images and push the result in image stores. The workflow looks like this: Procedure: Building and pushing images Define an image store. Define an image profile and associate it with a source (either a git repository or a directory). Build the image. Push the image to the image store. Uyuni supports two distinct build types: Dockerfile and the Kiwi image system. The Kiwi build type is used to build system, virtual, and other images. The image store for the Kiwi build type is pre-defined as a file system directory at /srv/www/os-images on the server. Uyuni serves the image store over HTTPS from ///os-images/. The image store location is unique and is not customizable. Images are stored in /srv/www/os-image/ORGANIZATION-ID. The containers feature is available for Salt clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 or later. Before you begin, ensure your environment meets these requirements: A published git repository containing a Dockerfile and configuration scripts. The repository can be public or private, and should be hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. A properly configured image store, such as a Docker registry. For more information on Containers, see https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/html/Container-guide/. To build images with Uyuni, you need to create and configure a build host. Container build hosts are Salt clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 or later. This section guides you through the initial configuration for a build host. The operating system on the build host must match the operating system on the targeted image. For example, build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SP2 or later) OS version. Build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 OS version. Cross-architecture builds are not supported. From the Uyuni Web UI, perform these steps to configure a build host: Procedure: Building a host Select a Salt client to be designated as a build host from the Systems Overview page. From the System Details page of the selected client assign the containers modules. Go to Software Software Channels and enable the containers module (for example, SLE-Module-Containers15-Pool and SLE-Module-Containers15-Updates). Confirm by clicking Change Subscriptions. From the System Details Properties page, enable Container Build Host from the Add-on System Types list. Confirm by clicking Update Properties. Install all required packages by applying Highstate. From the system details page select States Highstate and click Apply Highstate. Alternatively, apply Highstate from the Uyuni Server command line: salt '$your_client' state.highstate The containers built using Uyuni use channels associated to the activation key as repositories when building the image. This section guides you through creating an ad-hoc activation key for this purpose. To build a container, you need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than SUSE Manager Default. Procedure: Creating an activation key Select Systems Activation Keys. Click Create Key. Enter a Description and a Key name. Use the drop-down menu to select the Base Channel to associate with this key. Confirm with Create Activation Key. For more information, see Activation Keys. All built images are pushed to an image store. This section contains information about creating an image store. Procedure: Creating Image Store Select Images Stores. Click Create to create a new store. Define a name for the image store in the Label field. Provide the path to your image registry by filling in the URI field, as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the container registry host (whether internal or external). registry.example.com The Registry URI can also be used to specify an image store on a registry that is already in use. registry.example.com:5000/myregistry/myproject Click Create to add the new image store. All container images are built using an image profile, which contains the building instructions. This section contains information about creating an image profile with the Uyuni Web UI. Procedure: Creating an Image Profile To create an image profile select Images Profiles and click Create. Provide a name for the image profile by filling in the Label field. If your container image tag is in a format such as myproject/myimage, make sure your image store registry URI contains the /myproject suffix. Use a Dockerfile as the Image Type. Use the drop-down menu to select your registry from the Target Image Store field. In the Path field, type a GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repository URL. The URL should be http, https, or a token authentication URL. Use one of these formats: GitHub Path Options GitHub single user project repository https://github.com/USER/project.git#branchname:folder GitHub organization project repository https://github.com/ORG/project.git#branchname:folder GitHub token authentication If your git repository is private, modify the profile’s URL to include authentication. Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitHub token: https://USER:@github.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab single user project repository https://gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab groups project repository https://gitlab.example.com/GROUP/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab token authentication If your git repository is private and not publicly accessible, you need to modify the profile’s git URL to include authentication. Use this URL format to authenticate with a GitLab token: https://gitlab-ci-token:@gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ If you do not specify a git branch, the master branch is used by default. If a folder is not specified, the image sources (Dockerfile sources) are expected to be in the root directory of the GitHub or GitLab checkout. Select an Activation Key. Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages. When you associate an activation key with an image profile you are ensuring any image using the profile uses the correct software channel and any packages in the channel. Click the Create button. An Image Profile that can be reused is published at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The ARG parameters ensure that the built image is associated with the desired repository served by Uyuni. The ARG parameters also allow you to build image versions of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server which may differ from the version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server used by the build host itself. For example: The ARG repo parameter and the echo command pointing to the repository file, creates and then injects the correct path into the repository file for the desired channel version. The repository is determined by the activation key that you assigned to your image profile. FROM registry.example.com/sles12sp2 MAINTAINER Tux Administrator \"tux@example.com\" ### Begin: These lines Required for use with {productname} ARG repo ARG cert # Add the correct certificate RUN echo \"$cert\" > /etc/pki/trust/anchors/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT.pem # Update certificate trust store RUN update-ca-certificates # Add the repository path to the image RUN echo \"$repo\" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager:dockerbuild.repo ### End: These lines required for use with {productname} # Add the package script ADD add_packages.sh /root/add_packages.sh # Run the package script RUN /root/add_packages.sh # After building remove the repository path from image RUN rm -f /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager:dockerbuild.repo You can assign custom info key-value pairs to attach information to the image profiles. Additionally, these key-value pairs are passed to the Docker build command as buildargs. For more information about the available custom info keys and creating additional ones, see Custom System Information. There are two ways to build an image. You can select Images Build from the left navigation bar, or click the build icon in the Images Profiles list. Procedure: Building an image Select Images Build. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default latest (only relevant to containers). Select Build Profile and Build Host. Notice the Profile Summary to the right of the build fields. When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile is displayed in this area. To schedule a build click the Build button. You can import and inspect arbitrary images. Select Images Image List from the left navigation bar. Complete the text boxes of the Import dialog. When it has processed, the imported image is listed on the Image List page. Procedure: Importing an image From Images Image list click Import to open the Import Image dialog. In the Import Image dialog complete these fields: Image store The registry from where the image is pulled for inspection. Image name The name of the image in the registry. Image version The version of the image in the registry. Build host The build host that pulls and inspects the image. Activation key The activation key that provides the path to the software channel that the image is inspected with. For confirmation, click Import. The entry for the image is created in the database, and an Inspect Image action on Uyuni is scheduled. When it has been processed, you can find the imported image in the Image List. It has a different icon in the Build column, to indicate that the image is imported. The status icon for the imported image can also be seen on the Overview tab for the image. These are some known problems when working with images: HTTPS certificates to access the registry or the git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file. SSH git access using Docker is currently unsupported. OS Images are built by the Kiwi image system. The output image is customizable and can be PXE, QCOW2, LiveCD, or other types of images. For more information about the Kiwi build system, see the Kiwi documentation. The Kiwi image building feature is available for Salt clients running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11. Kiwi image configuration files and configuration scripts must be accessible in one of these locations: Git repository HTTP hosted tarball Local build host directory For an example of a complete Kiwi repository served by git, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. You need at least 1 GB of RAM available for hosts running OS Images built with Kiwi. Disk space depends on the actual size of the image. For more information, see the documentation of the underlying system. To build all kinds of images with Uyuni, create and configure a build host. OS Image build hosts are Salt clients running on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SP2 or later) or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (SP4 or later). This procedure guides you through the initial configuration for a build host. The operating system on the build host must match the operating system on the targeted image. For example, build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 (SP2 or later) OS version. Build SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 based images on a build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 OS version. Cross-architecture builds are not possible. For example, you must build Raspberry PI SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 image on a Raspberry PI (aarch64 architecture) build host running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3. Procedure: Configure the build host in the Uyuni Web UI Select a client to be designated as a build host from the Systems Overview page. Navigate to the System Details Properties tab, enable the Add-on System Type OS Image Build Host. Confirm with Update Properties. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and enable the required software channels depending on the build host version. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 build hosts require Uyuni Client tools (SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool and SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates). SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 build hosts require SUSE Linux Enterprise Server modules SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP4-Pool and SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP4-Updates. Schedule and click Confirm. Install Kiwi and all required packages by applying Highstate. From the system details page select States Highstate and click Apply Highstate. Alternatively, apply Highstate from the Uyuni Server command line: salt '$your_client' state.highstate Build host provisioning copies the Uyuni certificate RPM to the build host. This certificate is used for accessing repositories provided by Uyuni. The certificate is packaged in RPM by the mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage package script. The package script is called automatically during a new Uyuni installation. When you upgrade the spacewalk-certs-tools package, the upgrade scenario calls the package script using the default values. However if the certificate path was changed or unavailable, call the package script manually using --ca-cert-full-path after the upgrade procedure has finished. /usr/sbin/mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage --ca-cert-full-path /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT The RPM package with the certificate is stored in a salt-accessible directory such as: /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm The RPM package with the certificate is provided in the local build host repository: /var/lib/Kiwi/repo Specify the RPM package with the Uyuni SSL certificate in the build source, and make sure your Kiwi configuration contains rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage as a required package in the bootstrap section. Listing 1. config.xml ... ... ... Create an activation key associated with the channel that your OS Images can use as repositories when building the image. Activation keys are mandatory for OS Image building. To build OS Images, you need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than SUSE Manager Default. Procedure: Creating an activation key In the Web UI, select Systems Activation Keys. Click Create Key. Enter a Description, a Key name, and use the drop-down box to select a Base Channel to associate with the key. Confirm with Create Activation Key. For more information, see Activation Keys. OS Images can require a significant amount of storage space. Therefore, we recommended that the OS Image store is located on a partition of its own or on a Btrfs subvolume, separate from the root partition. By default, the image store is located at /srv/www/os-images. Image stores for Kiwi build type, used to build system, virtual, and other images, are not supported yet. Images are always stored in /srv/www/os-images/ORGANIZATION-ID and are accessible via HTTP/HTTPS https:///os-images/ORGANIZATION-ID. Manage image profiles using the Web UI. Procedure: Creating an Image Profile To create an image profile select from Images Profiles and click Create. In the Label field, provide a name for the Image Profile. Use Kiwi as the Image Type. Image store is automatically selected. Enter a Config URL to the directory containing the Kiwi configuration files: git URI HTTPS tarball Path to build host local directory Enter Kiwi options if needed. If the Kiwi configuration files specify multiple profiles, use --profile to select the active one. For other options, see Kiwi documentation. Select an Activation Key. Activation keys ensure that images using a profile are assigned to the correct channel and packages. Associate an activation key with an image profile to ensure the image profile uses the correct software channel, and any packages. Confirm with the Create button. Source format options git/HTTP(S) URL to the repository URL to the git repository containing the sources of the image to be built. Depending on the layout of the repository the URL can be: https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles You can specify a branch after the # character in the URL. In this example, we use the master branch: https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master You can specify a directory that contains the image sources after the : character. In this example, we use OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6: https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master:OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6 HTTP(S) URL to the tarball URL to the tar archive, compressed or uncompressed, hosted on the webserver. https://myimagesourceserver.example.org/MyKiwiImage.tar.gz Path to the directory on the build host Enter the path to the directory with the Kiwi build system sources. This directory must be present on the selected build host. /var/lib/Kiwi/MyKiwiImage Kiwi sources consist at least of config.xml. Usually, config.sh and images.sh are present as well. Sources can also contain files to be installed in the final image under the root subdirectory. For information about the Kiwi build system, see the Kiwi documentation. SUSE provides examples of fully functional image sources at the SUSE/manager-build-profiles public GitHub repository. Listing 2.

There are two ways to build an image using the Web UI. Either select Images Build, or click the build icon in the Images Profiles list. Procedure: Building an image Select Images Build. Add a different tag name if you want a version other than the default latest (applies only to containers). Select the Image Profile and a Build Host. A Profile Summary is displayed to the right of the build fields. When you have selected a build profile, detailed information about the selected profile is shown here. To schedule a build, click the Build button. The build server cannot run any form of automounter during the image building process. If applicable, ensure that you do not have your Gnome session running as root. If an automounter is running, the image build finishes successfully, but the checksum of the image is different and causes a failure. After the image is successfully built, the inspection phase begins. During the inspection phase SUSE Manager collects information about the image: List of packages installed in the image Checksum of the image Image type and other image details If the built image type is PXE, a Salt pillar is also generated. Image pillars are stored in the database and the Salt subsystem can access details about the generated image. Details include where the image files are located and provided, image checksums, information needed for network boot, and more. The generated pillar is available to all connected clients. Building an image requires several dependent steps. When the build fails, investigating Salt states results and build log can help identify the source of the failure. You can carry out these checks when the build fails: The build host can access the build sources There is enough disk space for the image on both the build host and the Uyuni server The activation key has the correct channels associated with it The build sources used are valid The RPM package with the Uyuni public certificate is up to date and available at /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm. For more on how to refresh a public certificate RPM, see Create a Build Host. The section contains some known issues when working with images. HTTPS certificates used to access the HTTP sources or git repositories should be deployed to the client by a custom state file, or configured manually. Importing Kiwi-based images is not supported. To list available built images select Images Image List. A list of all images is displayed. Displayed data about images includes an image Name, its Version, Revision, and the build Status. You can also see the image update status with a listing of possible patch and package updates that are available for the image. For OS Images, the Name and Version fields originate from Kiwi sources and are updated at the end of successful build. During building or after failed build these fields show a temporary name based on profile name. Revision is automatically increased after each successful build. For OS Images, multiple revisions can co-exist in the store. For Container Images the store holds only the latest revision. Information about previous revisions (packages, patches, etc.) are preserved and it is possible to list them with the Show obsolete checkbox. Clicking the Details button on an image provides a detailed view. The detailed view includes an exact list of relevant patches, list of all packages installed within the image and a build log. Clicking the Delete button deletes the image from the list. It also deletes the associated pillar, files from OS Image Store and obsolete revisions. The patch and the package list is only available if the inspect state after a build was successful.","title":"Image building and management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"image-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/image-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Proxy If you work with scheduled downtime periods, you might find it difficult to remember all the things that you need to do before, during, and after that critical downtime of the Uyuni Server. Uyuni Server related systems such as Inter-Server Synchronization Slave Servers or Uyuni Proxies are also affected and have to be considered. SUSE recommends you always keep your Uyuni infrastructure updated. That includes servers, proxies, and build hosts. If you do not keep the Uyuni Server updated, you might not be able to update some parts of your environment when you need to. This section contains a checklist for your downtime period, with links to further information on performing each of the steps. Procedure: Server checks Apply the latest updates. See Upgrade the Server. Upgrade to the latest service pack, if required. Run spacewalk-service status and check whether all required services are up and running. For information about database schema upgrades and PostgreSQL migrations, see Upgrade the Database. You can install updates using your package manager. For information on using YaST, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-onlineupdate-you.html. For information on using zypper, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-sw-cl.html#sec-zypper. By default, several update channels are configured and enabled for the Uyuni Server. New and updated packages become available automatically. When the server is updated consider updating some tools on the clients, too. Updating salt-minion, zypper, and other related management package on clients is not a strict requirement, but it is a best practice in general. For example, a maintenance update on the server might introduce a major new Salt version. Then Salt clients continue to work but might experience problems later on. To avoid this always update the salt-minion package when available. SUSE makes sure that salt-minion can always be updated safely. If you are using an Inter-Server Synchronization slave server, update it after the Uyuni Server update is complete. For more on Inter-Server Synchronization, see Inter-Server Synchronization. If you are using a monitoring server for Prometheus, update it after the Uyuni Server update is complete. For more information on monitoring, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Proxies should be updated as soon as Uyuni Server updates are complete. In general, running a proxy connected to a server on a different version is not supported. The only exception is for the duration of updates where it is expected that the server is updated first, so the proxy could run the previous version temporarily. If you are migrating from version 4.2 to 4.3, upgrade the server first, then any proxy. For more information, see Upgrade the Proxy.","title":"Infrastructure maintenance tasks","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"infra-maintenance","url":"/uyuni/administration/infra-maintenance.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS) allows you to connect two or more Uyuni Servers and keep them up-to-date. To set up ISS, you need to define one Uyuni Server as a master, with the other as a slave. If conflicting configurations exist, the system prioritizes the master configuration. ISS Masters are masters only because they have slaves attached to them. This means that you need to set up the ISS Master first, by defining its slaves. You can then set up the ISS Slaves, by attaching them to a master. Procedure: Setting up an ISS Master In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin ISS Configuration Master Setup, and click Add new slave. In the Edit Slave Details dialog, provide these details for the ISS Master’s first slave: In the Slave Fully Qualified Domain Name field, enter the FQDN of the ISS Slave. For example: server2.example.com. Check the Allow Slave to Sync? checkbox to enable the slave to synchronize with the master. Check the Sync All Orgs to Slave? checkbox to synchronize all organizations to this slave. Click Create to add the ISS slave. In the Allow Export of the Selected Organizations section, check the organizations you want to allow this slave to export to the master, and click Allow Orgs. Before you set up the ISS Slave, you need to ensure you have the appropriate CA certificate. Procedure: Copying the Master CA Certificate to an ISS Slave On the ISS Master, locate the CA Certificate at /srv/www/htdocs/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT and create a copy that can be transferred to the ISS Slave. On the ISS Slave, save the CA certificate file to the /etc/pki/trust/anchors/ directory. When you have copied the certificate, you can set up the ISS Slave. Procedure: Setting up an ISS Slave In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin ISS Configuration Slave Setup, and click Add new master.

Use spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle for Live Patching A reboot is required every time you update the full kernel package. Therefore, it is important that clients using Live Patching do not have newer kernels available in the channels they are assigned to. Clients using live patching have updates for the running kernel in the live patching channels. There are two ways to manage channels for live patching: Use content lifecycle management to clone the product tree and remove kernel versions newer than the running one. This procedure is explained in the administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#enhance-project-with-livepatching. This is the recommended solution. Alternatively, use the spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle tool. This procedure is more manual and requires command line tools as well as the Web UI. This procedure is explained in this section for SLES 15 SP5, but it also works for SLE 12 SP4 or later. Cloned vendor channels should be prefixed by dev for development, testing, or prod for production. In this procedure, you create a dev cloned channel and then promote the channel to testing. Procedure: Cloning Live Patching Channels At the command prompt on the client, as root, obtain the current package channel tree: # spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --list-channels Spacewalk Username: admin Spacewalk Password: Channel tree: 1. sles15-sp5-pool-x86_64 \\__ sle-live-patching15-pool-x86_64-sp5 \\__ sle-live-patching15-updates-x86_64-sp5 \\__ sle-manager-tools15-pool-x86_64-sp5 \\__ sle-manager-tools15-updates-x86_64-sp5 \\__ sles15-sp5-updates-x86_64 Use the spacewalk-manage-channel command with the init argument to automatically create a new development clone of the original vendor channel: spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --init -c sles15-sp5-pool-x86_64 Check that dev-sles15-sp5-updates-x86_64 is available in your channel list. Check the dev cloned channel you created, and remove any kernel updates that require a reboot. Procedure: Removing Non-Live Kernel Patches from Cloned Channels Check the current kernel version by selecting the client from Systems System List, and taking note of the version displayed in the Kernel field. In the Uyuni Web UI, select the client from Systems Overview, navigate to the Software Manage Channels tab, and select dev-sles15-sp5-updates-x86_64. Navigate to the Patches tab, and click List/Remove Patches. In the search bar, type kernel and identify the kernel version that matches the kernel currently used by your client. Remove all kernel versions that are newer than the currently installed kernel. Your channel is now set up for live patching, and can be promoted to testing. In this procedure, you also add the live patching child channels to your client, ready to be applied. Procedure: Promoting Live Patching Channels At the command prompt on the client, as root, promote and clone the dev-sles15-sp5-pool-x86_64 channel to a new testing channel: # spacewalk-manage-channel-lifecycle --promote -c dev-sles15-sp5-pool-x86_64 In the Uyuni Web UI, select the client from Systems Overview, and navigate to the Software Software Channels tab.

Maintenance Schedule Types 2. Restricted and Unrestricted Actions The maintenance windows feature in Uyuni allows you to schedule actions to occur during a scheduled maintenance window period. When you have created your maintenance window schedule, and applied it to a client, you are prevented from executing some actions outside of the specified period. Maintenance windows operate in a different way to system locking. System locks are switched on or off as required, while maintenance windows define periods of time when actions are allowed. Additionally, the allowed and restricted actions differ. For more information about system locks, see System Locking. Maintenance windows require both a calendar, and a schedule. The calendar defines the date and time of your maintenance window events, including recurring events, and must be in ical format. The schedule uses the events defined in the calendar to create the maintenance windows.

When you have created the schedule, you can assign it to clients that are registered to the Uyuni Server. Clients that have a maintenance schedule assigned cannot run restricted actions outside of maintenance windows. Restricted actions significantly modify the client, and could potentially cause the client to stop running.

Alternatively, you can assign clients through the system set manager by navigating to Systems System Set Manager and using the Misc Maintenance Windows tab. In the Edit System Details page, locate the Maintenance Schedule field, and select the name of the schedule to be assigned. Click Update Properties to assign the maintenance schedule. When you assign a new maintenance schedule to a client, it is possible that the client might already have some restricted actions scheduled, and that these might now conflict with the new maintenance schedule. If this occurs, the Web UI displays an error and you cannot assign the schedule to the client. To resolve this, check the Cancel affected actions option when you assign the schedule. This cancels any previously scheduled actions that conflict with the new maintenance schedule. When you have created your maintenance windows, you can schedule restricted actions, such as package upgrades, to be performed during the maintenance window. Procedure: Scheduling a Package Upgrade In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List, select the client you want to upgrade, and go to the Software Packages Upgrade tab. Select the package to upgrade from the list, and click Upgrade Packages. In the Maintenance Window field, select which maintenance window the client should use to perform the upgrade. Click Confirm to schedule the package upgrade. When you create a calendar, it contains a number of events, which can be either one-time events, or recurring events. Each event contains a summary field. If you want to create multiple maintenance schedules for one calendar, you can specify events for each using the summary field. For example, you might like to create a schedule for production servers, and a different schedule for testing servers. In this case, you would specify SUMMARY: Production Servers on events for the production servers, and SUMMARY: Testing Servers on events for the testing servers. There are two types of schedule: single, or multi. If your calendar contains events that apply to more than one schedule, then you must select multi, and ensure you name the schedule according to the summary field you used in the calendar file. Procedure: Creating a Multi Schedule In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Schedule Maintenance Windows Schedules, and click Create. In the Schedule Name section, type the name for your schedule. Ensure it matches the summary field of the calendar. Check the Multi option. Select the calendar to assign to this schedule. Click Create Schedule to save your schedule. To create the next schedule, click Create. In the Schedule Name section, type the name for your second schedule. Ensure it matches the summary field of the second calendar. Check the Multi option. Click Create Schedule to save your schedule. Repeat for each schedule you need to create. This sections contains a complete list of restricted and unrestricted actions. Restricted actions significantly modify the client, and could potentially cause the client to stop running. Restricted actions can only be run during a maintenance window. The restricted actions are: Package operations (for example, installing, updating, or removing packages) Patch updates Rebooting a client Rolling back transactions Configuration management changing tasks Applying a highstate (for Salt clients) Autoinstallation and reinstallation Remote commands Product migrations Cluster operations For Salt clients, it is possible to run remote commands directly at any time by navigating to Salt Remote Commands. This applies whether or not the Salt client is in a maintenance window. For more information about remote commands, see Actions. Unrestricted actions are minor actions that are considered safe and are unlikely to cause problems on the client. If an action is not restricted it is, by definition, unrestricted, and can be be run at any time.","title":"Maintenance Windows","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"maintenance-windows","url":"/uyuni/administration/maintenance-windows.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Server Self Monitoring 3.2. Monitoring Managed Systems 3.3. Change Grafana Password 4. Network Boundaries 4.1. Reverse Proxy Setup 5. Security 5.1. Generating TLS certificates You can monitor your Uyuni environment using Prometheus and Grafana. Uyuni Server and Proxy are able to provide self-health metrics. You can also install and manage a number of Prometheus exporters on Salt clients. Prometheus and Grafana packages are included in the Uyuni Client Tools for: SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 openSUSE Leap 15.x You need to install Prometheus and Grafana on a machine separate from the Uyuni Server. We recommend to use a managed Salt SUSE client as your monitoring server. Other clients are not supported as a monitoring server. Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to monitored clients. Clients must have corresponding open ports and be reachable over the network. Alternatively, you can use reverse proxies to establish a connection. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring tool that is used to record real-time metrics in a time-series database. Metrics are pulled via HTTP, enabling high performance and scalability. Prometheus metrics are time series data, or timestamped values belonging to the same group or dimension. A metric is uniquely identified by its name and set of labels. metric name labels timestamp value ┌────────┴───────┐ ┌───────────┴───────────┐ ┌──────┴──────┐ ┌─┴─┐ http_requests_total{status=\"200\", method=\"GET\"} @1557331801.111 42236 Each application or system being monitored must expose metrics in the format above, either through code instrumentation or Prometheus exporters. Exporters are libraries that help with exporting metrics from third-party systems as Prometheus metrics. Exporters are useful whenever it is not feasible to instrument a given application or system with Prometheus metrics directly. Multiple exporters can run on a monitored host to export local metrics. The Prometheus community provides a list of official exporters, and more can be found as community contributions. For more information and an extensive list of exporters, see https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/. Grafana is a tool for data visualization, monitoring, and analysis. It is used to create dashboards with panels representing specific metrics over a set period of time. Grafana is commonly used together with Prometheus, but also supports other data sources such as ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Influx DB. For more information about Grafana, see https://grafana.com/docs/. To set up your monitoring server, you need to install Prometheus and Grafana, and configure them. If your monitoring server is a Salt client, you can install the Prometheus package using the Uyuni Web UI. Otherwise you can download and install the package on your monitoring server manually. The Prometheus software is also available for Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni for Retail Branch Server. Prometheus expects POSIX filesystem for storing data. Non-POSIX compliant filesystems are not supported. NFS filesystems are not supported. Procedure: Installing Prometheus Using the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, open the details page of the system where Prometheus is to be installed, and navigate to the Formulas tab.

For more information on how to manually install and configure Grafana, see https://grafana.com/docs. With Uyuni 4 and higher, you can enable the server to expose Prometheus self-health metrics, and also install and configure exporters on client systems. The Server self-health metrics cover hardware, operating system and Uyuni internals. These metrics are made available by instrumentation of the Java application, combined with Prometheus exporters. These exporter packages are shipped with Uyuni Server: Node exporter: golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter. PostgreSQL exporter: prometheus-postgres_exporter. See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter. JMX exporter: prometheus-jmx_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter. Apache exporter: golang-github-lusitaniae-apache_exporter. See https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter. These exporter packages are shipped with Uyuni Proxy: Node exporter: golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter. Squid exporter: golang-github-boynux-squid_exporter. See https://github.com/boynux/squid-exporter. The exporter packages are pre-installed in Uyuni Server and Proxy, but their respective systemd daemons are disabled by default. Procedure: Enabling Self Monitoring In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Manager Configuration Monitoring. Click Enable services. Restart Tomcat and Taskomatic. Navigate to the URL of your Prometheus server, on port 9090 (for example, http://example.com:9090) In the Prometheus UI, navigate to Status Targets and confirm that all the endpoints on the mgr-server group are up. If you have also installed Grafana with the Web UI, the server insights are visible on the Uyuni Server dashboard, in the Admin Manager Configuration Monitoring. Only server self-health monitoring can be enabled using the Web UI. Metrics for a proxy are not automatically collected by Prometheus. To enable self-health monitoring on a proxy, you need to manually install exporters and enable them. The following relevant metrics are collected on the Uyuni Server. Table 1. Server statistics (port 80) Metric Type Description uyuni_all_systems gauge Number of all systems uyuni_virtual_systems gauge Number of virtual systems uyuni_inactive_systems gauge Number of inactive systems uyuni_outdated_systems gauge Number of systems with outdated packages Table 2. PostgreSQL exporter (port 9187) Metric Type Description pg_stat_database_tup_fetched counter Number of rows fetched by queries pg_stat_database_tup_inserted counter Number of rows inserted by queries pg_stat_database_tup_updated counter Number of rows updated by queries pg_stat_database_tup_deleted counter Number of rows deleted by queries mgr_serveractions_completed gauge Number of completed actions mgr_serveractions_failed gauge Number of failed actions mgr_serveractions_picked_up gauge Number of picked-up actions mgr_serveractions_queued gauge Number of queued actions Table 3. JMX exporter (Tomcat port 5556, Taskomatic port 5557) Metric Type Description java_lang_Threading_ThreadCount gauge Number of active threads java_lang_Memory_HeapMemoryUsage_used gauge Current heap memory usage Table 4. Server Message Queue (port 80) Metric Type Description message_queue_thread_pool_threads counter Number of message queue threads ever created message_queue_thread_pool_threads_active gauge Number of currently active message queue threads message_queue_thread_pool_task_count counter Number of tasks ever submitted message_queue_thread_pool_completed_task_count counter Number of tasks ever completed Table 5. Salt Queue (port 80) Metric Type Description salt_queue_thread_pool_size gauge Number of threads created per Salt queue salt_queue_thread_pool_active_threads gauge Number of currently active Salt threads per queue salt_queue_thread_pool_task_total counter Number of tasks ever submitted per queue salt_queue_thread_pool_completed_task_total counter Number of tasks ever completed per queue Every salt_queue value has a label named queue with the queue number as value. Table 6. Taskomatic Scheduler (port 9800) Metric Type Description taskomatic_scheduler_threads counter Number of scheduler threads ever created taskomatic_scheduler_threads_active gauge Number of currently active scheduler threads taskomatic_scheduler_completed_task_count counter Number of tasks ever completed Prometheus metrics exporters can be installed and configured on Salt clients using formulas. The packages are available from the Uyuni client tools channels, and can be enabled and configured directly in the Uyuni Web UI. These exporters can be installed on managed systems: Node exporter: golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter. See https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter. PostgreSQL exporter: prometheus-postgres_exporter. See https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter. Apache exporter: golang-github-lusitaniae-apache_exporter. See https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter. On SLE Micro, only the Node exporter and the Blackbox exporter are available. When you have the exporters installed and configured, you can start using Prometheus to collect metrics from the monitored systems. If you have configured your monitoring server with the Web UI, metrics collection happens automatically. Procedure: Configuring Prometheus Exporters on a Client In the Uyuni Web UI, open the details page of the client to be monitored, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Check the Enabled checkbox on the Prometheus Exporters formula. Click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Prometheus Exporters tab. Select the exporters you want to enable and customize arguments according to your needs. The Address field accepts either a port number preceded by a colon (:9100), or a fully resolvable address (example:9100). Click Save Formula. Apply the highstate. Monitoring formulas can also be configured for System Groups, by applying the same configuration used for individual systems inside the corresponding group. For more information about the monitoring formulas, see Monitoring Formula. To change the Grafana password follow the steps described in the Grafana documentation: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/user-management/user-preferences/#change-your-grafana-password In case you have lost the Grafana administrator password you can reset it as root with the following command: grafana-cli --configOverrides cfg:default.paths.data=/var/lib/grafana --homepath /usr/share/grafana admin reset-admin-password Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to monitored clients. By default, Prometheus uses these ports: Node exporter: 9100 PostgreSQL exporter: 9187 Apache exporter: 9117 Additionally, if you are running the alert manager on a different host than where you run Prometheus, you also need to open port 9093. For clients installed on cloud instances, you can add the required ports to a security group that has access to the monitoring server. Alternatively, you can deploy a Prometheus instance in the exporters' local network, and configure federation. This allows the main monitoring server to scrape the time series from the local Prometheus instance. If you use this method, you only need to open the Prometheus API port, which is 9090. For more information on Prometheus federation, see https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/. You can also proxy requests through the network boundary. Tools like PushProx deploy a proxy and a client on both sides of the network barrier and allow Prometheus to work across network topologies such as NAT. For more information on PushProx, see https://github.com/RobustPerception/PushProx. Prometheus fetches metrics using a pull mechanism, so the server must be able to establish TCP connections to each exporter on the monitored clients. To simplify your firewall configuration, you can use reverse proxy for your exporters to expose all metrics on a single port. Procedure: Installing Prometheus Exporters with Reverse Proxy In the Uyuni Web UI, open the details page of the system to be monitored, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Check the Prometheus Exporters checkbox to enable the exporters formula, and click Save. Navigate to the Prometheus Exporters tab in the top menu. Check the Enable reverse proxy option, and enter a valid reverse proxy port number. For example, 9999. Customize the other exporters according to your needs. Click Save Formula. Apply the highstate and confirm that it completes successfully. For more information about the monitoring formulas, see Monitoring Formula. Prometheus server and Prometheus node exporter offer a built-in mechanism to secure their endpoints with TLS encryption and authentication. Uyuni Web UI simplifies the configuration of all involved components. The TLS certificates have to be provided and deployed by the user. Uyuni offers enabling the following security model: Node exporter: TLS encryption and client certificate based authentication Prometheus: TLS encryption and basic authentication For more information about configuring all available options, see Monitoring Formula. By default, Uyuni does not provide any certificates for securing monitoring configuration. For providing security, you can generate or import custom certificates, self-signed or signed by a third party certificate authority (CA). This section demonstrates how to generate client/server certificates for Prometheus and Node exporter minions self-signed with SUSE Manager CA. Procedure: Creating server/client TLS certificate On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, run following command: rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-email=\"name@example.com\" \\ --set-hostname=\"minion.example.com\" --set-cname=\"minion.example.com\" --no-rpm Ensure that the set-cname parameter is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Salt client. You can use the the set-cname parameter multiple times if you require multiple aliases. Copy server.crt and server.key files to the Salt minion and provide read access for prometheus user.","title":"Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"monitoring","url":"/uyuni/administration/monitoring.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It allows you to schedule and view compliance scans for any client. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a synthesis of interoperable specifications derived from community ideas. It is a line of specifications maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for maintaining system security for enterprise systems. SCAP was created to provide a standardized approach to maintaining system security, and the standards that are used continually change to meet the needs of the community and enterprise businesses. New specifications are governed by NIST’s SCAP Release cycle to provide a consistent and repeatable revision work flow. For more information, see: http://scap.nist.gov/timeline.html https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol https://www.open-scap.org/features/standards/ https://ncp.nist.gov/repository?scap Uyuni uses OpenSCAP to implement the SCAP specifications. OpenSCAP is an auditing tool that utilizes the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF). XCCDF is a standard way of expressing checklist content and defines security checklists. It also combines with other specifications such as Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE), and Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL), to create a SCAP-expressed checklist that can be processed by SCAP-validated products. OpenSCAP verifies the presence of patches by using content produced by the SUSE Security Team. OpenSCAP checks system security configuration settings and examines systems for signs of compromise by using rules based on standards and specifications. For more information about the SUSE Security Team, see https://www.suse.com/support/security. Before you begin, you need to prepare your client systems for SCAP scanning. OpenSCAP auditing is not available on Salt clients that use the SSH contact method. Scanning clients can consume a lot of memory and compute power on the client being scanned. For Red Hat clients, ensure you have at least 2 GB of RAM available on each client to be scanned. Install the OpenSCAP scanner and the SCAP Security Guide (content) packages on the client before you begin. Depending on the operating system, these packages are included either on the base operating system, or in the Uyuni Client Tools. The table below lists the packages you need: Table 1. OpenSCAP packages Operating system Scanner Content SLES openscap-utils scap-security-guide openSUSE openscap-utils scap-security-guide RHEL openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat CentOS openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Oracle Linux openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Ubuntu libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-ubuntu Debian libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-debian RHEL 7 and compatible systems provide a scap-security-guide package, which contains outdated contents. You are advised to use the scap-security-guide-redhat package you will find in the Uyuni Client Tools. SUSE provides the scap-security-guide package for different openscap profiles. In the current version of scap-security-guide, SUSE supports the following profiles: DISA STIG profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 15 PCI-DSS profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 15 HIPAA profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and 15 Other profiles, like the CIS profile, are community supplied and not officially supported by SUSE. For Non-SUSE operating systems the included profiles are community supplied. They are not officially supported by SUSE. OpenSCAP uses SCAP content files to define test rules. These content files are created based on the XCCDF or OVAL standards. In addition to the SCAP Security Guide, you can download publicly available content files and customize it to your requirements. You can install the SCAP Security Guide package for default content file templates. Alternatively, if you are familiar with XCCDF or OVAL, you can create your own content files. We recommend you use templates to create your SCAP content files. If you create and use your own custom content files, you do so at your own risk. If your system becomes damaged through the use of custom content files, you might not be supported by SUSE. When you have created your content files, you need to transfer the file to the client. You can do this in the same way as you move any other file, using physical storage media, or across a network with Salt (for example, salt-cp or the Salt File Server), ftp or scp. We recommend that you create a package to distribute content files to clients that you are managing with Uyuni. Packages can be signed and verified to ensure their integrity. For more information, see Custom Channels. Different operating systems make available different OpenSCAP content files and profiles. One content file may contain more than one profile. On RPM-based operating systems, use this command to determine the location of the available SCAP files: rpm -ql On DEB-based operating systems, use this command to determine the location of the available SCAP files: dpkg -L When you have identified one SCAP content file that suits your needs, list profiles available on the client: oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml Document type: Source Data Stream Imported: 2021-03-24T18:14:45 Stream: scap_org.open-scap_datastream_from_xccdf_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml Generated: (null) Version: 1.2 Checklists: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml Status: draft Generated: 2021-03-24 Resolved: true Profiles: Title: CIS SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Benchmark Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis Title: Standard System Security Profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard Title: DISA STIG for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig Referenced check files: ssg-sle15-oval.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 ssg-sle15-ocil.xml system: http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2 https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/suse.linux.enterprise.15.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 Checks: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-oval.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-ocil.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-oval.xml Dictionaries: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-dictionary.xml Take a note of the file paths and profiles for performing the scan. When you have installed or transferred your content files, you can perform audit scans. Audit scans can be triggered using the Uyuni Web UI. You can also use the Uyuni API to schedule regular scans. Procedure: Running an Audit Scan from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client you want to scan. Navigate to the Audit tab, and the Schedule subtab. In the Path to XCCDF Document field, enter the parameters for the SCAP template and profile you want to use on the client. For example: Command: /usr/bin/oscap xccdf eval Command-line arguments: --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig Path to XCCDF document: /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml If you use --fetch-remote-resources parameter a lot of RAM is required. In addition, you may need to increase the value of file_recv_max_size. The scan runs at the client’s next scheduled synchronization. The XCCDF content file is validated before it is run on the remote system. If the content file includes invalid arguments, the test fails. Procedure: Running an Audit Scan from the API Before you begin, ensure that the client to be scanned has Python and XML-RPC libraries installed. Choose an existing script or create a script for scheduling a system scan through system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan. For example: #!/usr/bin/python3 client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('https://server.example.com/rpc/api') key = client.auth.login('username', 'password') client.system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan(key, , '', '--profile ') In this example: * is the system ID (sid). * is the path to the content file location on the client. For example, /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml. * is an additional argument for the oscap command. For example, use united_states_government_configuration_baseline (USGCB). Run the script on the client you want to scan, from the command prompt. Information about the scans you have run is in the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to to Audit OpenSCAP All Scans for a table of results. For more information about the data in this table, see All Scans. To ensure that detailed information about scans is available, you need to enable it on the client. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations and click on the organization the client is a part of. Navigate to the Configuration tab, and check the Enable Upload of Detailed SCAP Files option. When enabled, this generates an additional HTML file on every scan, which contains extra information. The results show an extra line similar to this: Detailed Results: xccdf-report.html xccdf-results.xml scap-yast2sec-oval.xml.result.xml To retrieve scan information from the command line, use the spacewalk-report command: spacewalk-report system-history-scap spacewalk-report scap-scan spacewalk-report scap-scan-results You can also use the Uyuni API to view results, with the system.scap handler. Remediation Bash scripts and Ansible playbooks are provided in the same SCAP Security Guide packages to harden the client systems. For example: Listing 1. bash scripts /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-cis.sh /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-standard.sh /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-stig.sh Listing 2.

Install the scap-security-guide package on all your target systems. For more information, see Setup Ansible control node. Packages, channels and scripts are different for each operating system and distribution. Examples are listed in the Example remediation Bash scripts section. Run the Bash script as a remote command on single systems. From System Overview tab, select your instance. Then in Details Remote Commands, write a Bash script such as: #!/bin/bash chmod +x -R /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-stig.sh Click Schedule. Folder and script names change between distribution and version. Examples are listed in the Example remediation Bash scripts section. Run the Bash script as a remote command on multiple systems at once. When a system group has been created click System Groups, select Use in SSM from the table. From the System Set Manager, under Misc Remote Command, write a Bash script such as: #!/bin/bash chmod +x -R /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash /usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/sle15-script-stig.sh Click Schedule.

Manage Organizations 1.1. Organization Users 1.2. Trusted Organizations 1.3. Configure Organizations 2. Manage States 2.1. Manage Configuration Channels Organizations are used to manage user access and permissions within Uyuni. For most environments, a single organization is enough. However, more complicated environments might need several organizations. You might like to have an organization for each physical location within your business, or for different business functions. When you have created your organizations, you can create and assign users to your organizations. You can then assign permissions on an organization level, which applies by default to every user assigned to the organization. You can also configure authentication methods for your new organization, including PAM and single sign-on. For more information about authentication, see Authentication Methods. You must be logged in as the Uyuni administrator to create and manage organizations. Procedure: Creating a New Organization In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations, and click Create Organization. In the Create Organization dialog, complete these fields: In the Organization Name field, type a name for your new organization. The name should be between 3 and 128 characters long. In the Desired Login field, type the login name you want to use for the organization’s administrator. This must be a new administrator account, you are not be able to use an existing administrator account to sign in to the new organization, including the one you are currently signed in with. In the Desired Password field, type a password for the new organization’s administrator. Confirm the password by typing it again in the Confirm Password field. Password strength is indicated by the colored bar beneath the password fields. In the Email field, type an email address for the new organization’s administrator. In the First Name field, select a salutation, and type a given name for the new organization’s administrator. In the Last Name field, type a surname for the new organization’s administrator. Click Create Organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Organizations to see a list of available organizations. Click the name of an organization to manage it. From the Admin Organizations section, you can access tabs to manage users, trusts, configuration, and states for your organization. Organizations can only be managed by their administrators. To manage an organization, ensure you are signed in as the correct administrator for the organization you want to change. Navigate to the Users tab to view the list of all users associated with the organization, and their role. Clicking a username takes you to the Users menu to add, change, or delete users. Navigate to the Trusts tab to add or remove trusted organizations. Establishing trust between organizations allow them to share content between them, and gives you the ability to transfer clients from one organization to another. Navigate to the Configuration tab to manage the configuration of your organization. This includes the use of staged contents, and the use of SCAP files. For more information about content staging, see Content Staging. For more information about OpenSCAP, see OpenSCAP. Navigate to the States tab to manage Salt states for all clients in your organization. States allow you to define global security policies, or add a common admin user to all clients. For more information about Salt States, see Salt States and Pillars. You can select which configuration channels should be applied across your organization. Configuration channels can be created in the Uyuni Web UI by navigating to Configuration Channels. Apply configuration channels to your organization using the Uyuni Web UI. Procedure: Applying Configuration Channels to an Organization In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Configuration Channels. Use the search feature to locate a channel by name. Check the channel to be applied and click Save Changes. This saves to the database, but does not apply the changes to the channel. Apply the changes by clicking Apply.

Retracted Patches 1.1. Channel Clones 1.2. Patch sharing This chapter contains various topics related to patch management. When a new patch gets released by the vendor, it might happen that the patch has undesirable side effects (security, stability) in some scenario that was not identified by testing. When this happens (very rarely), vendors typically release a new patch, which may take hours or days, depending on the internal processes in place by that vendor. SUSE has introduced a new mechanism (2021) called \"retracted patches\" to revoke such patches almost immediately by setting their advisory status to \"retracted\" (instead of \"final\" or \"stable\"). A patch is \"retracted,\" when its advisory status attribute is set to \"retracted.\" A package is \"retracted,\" when it belongs to a \"retracted\" patch. A retracted patch or package cannot be installed on systems with Uyuni. The only way to install a retracted package, is to do it manually with zypper install and specifying the exact package version. For example: zypper install vim-8.0.1568-5.14.1 Retracted status of patches and packages is depicted with the icon in the Web UI of Uyuni. For example, see: list of packages in a channel list of patches in a channel When a patch or package, that has been installed on a system, gets retracted, the icon is also displayed in the installed packages list of that system. Uyuni does not provide a way to downgrade such a patch or package. When using cloned channels, you must pay attention to the propagation of the retracted advisory status from the original channels to the clones. Upon cloning vendor channels into your organization, channel patches will be cloned as well. When the vendor retracts a patch in a channel and Uyuni synchronizes this channel (for example, with the nightly job), the \"retracted\" attribute will not get propagated to the cloned patches and will not be observed by the clients subscribed to cloned channels. To propagate the attribute to your cloned channels use one of the following ways: Patch Sync (Software Manage cloned channel Patches Sync). This function allows you to align the attributes of patches in your cloned channel to their originals. Content Lifecycle Management. For more information about cloned channels in the context of Content Lifecycle Management, see Software Channels. When you create multiple vendor channel clones in your organization, the patches are not cloned multiple times, but are shared between cloned channels. As a consequence, when you synchronize your cloned patch (either using the patch sync function or with Content Lifecycle Management mentioned above), all channels using the cloned patch will observe that change. Example: Consider two Content Lifecycle Management projects prj1 and prj2 Both of these projects have 2 environments dev and test Both of these projects have a vendor channel set as a source channel All channels in this scenario (four cloned channels in total) are aligned to the latest state of the vendor channels Vendor retracts a patch in the source channel and the nighly job synchronizes it to your Uyuni None of the four channels see this change because they are using a patch clone, not the patch directly. As soon as you synchronize your patch (either you build any of these two projects, or you use the Patch Sync function on any of the four cloned channels), due to the patch sharing, ALL of the cloned channels will see the patch as retracted.","title":"Patch Management","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"patch-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/patch-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Removing the patched version of a package 5. Removing the patched version of a package on the client SUSE provides temporary fixes for all currently supported solutions shipped directly to its customers. These PTFs (Program Temporary Fixes) are now available as repositories, which can be synced in Uyuni. PTF packages are installed via a proxy package and are named ptf-xxxxxx, where xxxxxx is a number and part of the name of the package, not its version. They will depend on the correct version of the package that is known to include the correction in the software. This type of package: cannot be installed accidentally (i.e. zypper update will never suggest installing them), cannot be removed accidentally (i.e. a newer package version will not replace the PTF one, unless the user makes it explicitly on the zypper command line), is only updated when the newer version is known to address the specific issue previously solved by the PTF, updates only packages already installed on the system (i.e. if a software is split into multiple packages, the PTF will replace only those currently installed on the system). The correct ID of the package will be provided by SUSE Support during the course of the support case investigation, along with instruction on how to deploy/restart the affected services. PTF packages are currently only supported for SLE 12 and SLE 15 based systems. Other versions or operating systems do not have this feature and the pages are not visible for them. Procedure: Enabling and synchronizing PTF repositories using the command line On the console enter mgr-sync refresh. Enter mgr-sync list channel and look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. For example, a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Enable the PTF channel with mgr-sync add channel . This channel is now available and can be added to every system which is using the same base channel. PTF packages need to be installed explicitly, since they are not automatically picked up when updating a system. The SUSE Customer Support will provide the PTF number to fix a specific problem. With the number the proxy package can be identified in the PTF list. In Uyuni Web UI every system with PTFs available for installation has a page which lists them. Procedure: Enabling and synchronizing PTF repositories via the Uyuni Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Products and look for the product you want to enable the PTF repository for. Click Show product’s channels next to the products sync status. You should see a popup listing mandatory and optional channels for the product. In the optional channels list look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. For example a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Select the channel using the checkbox next to its name and click Confirm to schedule the sync. Note that the product has to be installed to be able to add optional channels to it. Procedure: Installing the PTF packages In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client where you want to install a PTF. Navigate to the Systems Software Packages Software Channels and select the PTF channel. Click Next, and Confirm Software Channel Change with Confirm. To check if the channel assignment is finished, navigate to Systems Events History to see the results. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs Install sub tab. Select the PTF package you want to install. Click Install PTF, and Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Installation with Confirm. To see PTF installation results, navigate to Systems Events History. In case a PTF should be installed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageInstall API can be used with the proxy package name. Once a PTF is confirmed to address the reported issue, the updated package will be tracked for inclusion into a future maintenance update before being widely distributed as an regular maintenance update in the update repositories. When this regular update with the fix is released, an updated version of the PTF will also be released into the account-specific PTF repository. The updated PTF will remove the strict dependencies and allow updates to be installed again. The replacement of the PTF with the maintenance update which includes the fix happens automatically via a standard package update or patch installation. In cases where a PTF needs to be uninstalled and the non-patched version of the packages need to be installed on the system, a simple package remove cannot be used. The PTF package is not selectable in the standard package list page. Procedure: Removing the PTF packages In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client you want to remove a PTF from. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs List/Remove sub tab. Select the ptf package you want to remove. Click Remove PTFs, and on the Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Removal page click Confirm. To see the results, navigate to Systems Events History. Removing PTFs requires a special version of libzypp and zypper to be installed on the client system. Check zypper --help to confirm whether removeptf is supported. The List/Remove tab is only visible if this condition is met. In case the PTF should be removed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageRemove API can be used with the proxy package name. In case a PTF should be removed directly on the client using the console, it is required to use a special command zypper removeptf. All other ways result either in an error or can lead to unwanted behavior like removing important packages from the system and make the system unusable.","title":"Using PTFs in Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"ptfs","url":"/uyuni/administration/ptfs.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The spacewalk-report command allows you to organize and display reports about content, systems, and user resources across Uyuni. Due to the introduction of Hub Reporting, spacewalk-report now gathers by default the data from the reporting database. See spacewalk-report and the reporting database for more information. You can generate reports on: System Inventory: list all the systems registered to Uyuni. Patches: list all the patches relevant to the registered systems. You can sort patches by severity, as well as the systems that apply to a particular patch. Users: list all registered users and any systems associated with a particular user. To get the report in CSV format, run this command at the command prompt on the server: spacewalk-report spacewalk-report uses by default the new reporting database to extract the data. This means that the new generated reports will have some differences in the structure and the format of the data. The differences common to all reports are: the report data is not changing in real-time, but it’s updated only by the execution of a scheduled task; data duplication has been removed and columns that were previously considered \"multival\" contain now multiple values separated by ;. This also means that the command line options --multival-on-rows and --multival-separator are no longer applicable to the new reports, as their behavior is now the default; in all reports the new columns mgm_id and synced_date have been introduced to identify the management server in the hub scenario and the last time the information was updated from the application database; all boolean values are now represented by the True/False and not by a 1/0 values; the column org_id has been replaced by organization, which contains the organization name and not the numerical identifier; The term \"server\" has been replaced by \"system.\" So, for example, the column server_id is now called system_id. For report specific changes, see List of available reports. If this changed behavior causes trouble, the new option --legacy-report can be used to fall back to the old report, which is executed against the application database.

Disable Space Checking Running out of disk space can have a severe impact on the Uyuni database and file structure which, in some cases, is not recoverable. Uyuni monitors some directories for free disk space. You can modify which directories are monitored, and the warnings that are created. All settings are configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. When the available space in one of the monitored directories falls below a warning threshold, a message is sent to the configured email address and a notification is shown at the top of the sign-in page. By default, Uyuni monitors these directories: /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk /var/cache /srv You can change which directories are monitored with the spacecheck_dirs parameter. You can specify multiple directories by separating them with a space. For example: spacecheck_dirs = /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk /var/cache /srv By default, Uyuni creates a warning when a monitored directory has less than 10% of total space available. A critical alert is created when a monitored directory falls below 5% space available. You can change these alert thresholds with the spacecheck_free_alert and spacecheck_free_critical parameters. For example: spacecheck_free_alert = 10 spacecheck_free_critical = 5 By default, Uyuni shuts down the spacewalk services when the critical alert threshold is reached. You can change this behavior with the spacecheck_shutdown parameter. A value of true enables the shut down feature. Any other value disables it. For example: spacecheck_shutdown = true The space checking tool is enabled by default. You can disable it entirely with these commands: systemctl stop spacewalk-diskcheck.timer systemctl disable spacewalk-diskcheck.timer Disabling the spacewalk-diskcheck.timer will stop periodic email alerts if the alert threshold is reached, but the warning notification will still appear at the top of the sign-in page.","title":"Managing Disk Space","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"space-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/space-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Import Certificates for New Installations 2. Import Certificates for New Proxy Installations 3. Replace Certificates This section covers how to configure SSL certificate for new Uyuni installation, and how to replace existing certificates. Before you begin, ensure you have: A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate. If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available. An SSL server private key An SSL server certificate All files must be in PEM format. The host name of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified host name of the machine you deploy them on. You can set the host names in the X509v3 Subject Alternative Name section of the certificate. You can also list multiple host names if your environment requires it. Supported Key types are RSA and EC (Elliptic Curve). Third-party authorities commonly use intermediate CAs to sign requested server certificates. In this case, all CAs in the chain are required to be available. If there is no extra parameter or option available to specify intermediate CAs, take care that all CAs (Root CA and intermediate CAs) are stored in one file. By default, Uyuni uses a self-signed certificate. After you have completed the initial setup, you can replace the default certificate with an imported certificate. Procedure: Import Certificates on a New Uyuni Server Install the Uyuni Server according to the instructions in Installation. Complete the initial setup according to SUSE Manager Server Setup. At the command prompt, point the SSL environment variables to the certificate file locations: export CA_CERT= export SERVER_KEY= export SERVER_CERT= Complete Uyuni setup: yast susemanager_setup When you are prompted for certificate details during setup, fill in random values. The values are overridden by the values you specified at the command prompt. Execute the yast susemanager_setup command from the same shell you exported the environment variables from. By default, Uyuni Proxy uses a self-signed certificate. After you have completed the initial setup, you can replace the default certificate with an imported certificate. Procedure: Import Certificates on a New Uyuni Proxy Install the Uyuni Proxy according to the instructions in Installation. Complete the initial setup according to SUSE Manager Proxy Setup. At the command prompt, run: configure-proxy.sh At the Do you want to import existing certificates? prompt, type y. Follow the prompts to complete setup. Use the same certificate authority to sign all server certificates for servers and proxies. Certificates signed with different CAs do not match. You can replace active certificates on your Uyuni installation with a new certificate. To replace the certificates, you can replace the installed CA certificate with the new CA, and then update the database. Procedure: Replacing Existing Certificates On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, call the command mgr-ssl-cert-setup and provide the certificates as parameters: mgr-ssl-cert-setup --root-ca-file= --server-cert-file= --server-key-file= Intermediate CAs can either be available in the file which is specified with --root-ca-file or specified as extra options with --intermediate-ca-file. The --intermediate-ca-file option can be specified multiple times. This command performs a number of tests on the provided files to test if they are valid and can be used for the requested use case. Restart services to pick up the changes: spacewalk-service stop systemctl restart postgresql.service spacewalk-service start If you are using a proxy, you need to generate a server certificate RPM for each proxy, using their host names and cnames. You should use mgr-ssl-cert-setup also on a Uyuni Proxy to replace the certificates. Because the Uyuni Proxy does not have a postgreSQL database, only spacewalk-service restart is sufficient. If the Root CA was changed, it needs to get deployed to all the clients connected to Uyuni. Procedure: Deploying the Root CA on Salt Clients In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Overview. Check all your Salt Clients to add them to the system set manager. Navigate to Systems System Set Manager Overview. In the States field, click Apply to apply the system states.

Create a new CA and Server Certificates By default, Uyuni uses a self-signed certificate. In this case, the certificate is created and signed by Uyuni. This method does not use an independent certificate authority to guarantee that the details of the certificate are correct. Third party CAs perform checks to ensure that the information contained in the certificate is correct. For more on third party CAs, see Import SSL Certificates. This section covers how to create or re-create your self-signed certificates on new or existing installation. The host name of the SSL keys and certificates must match the fully qualified host name of the machine you deploy them on. If your existing certificates have expired or stopped working for any reason, you can generate a new server certificate from the existing CA. Procedure: Re-Creating an Existing Server Certificate On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, regenerate the server certificate: rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-email=\"name@example.com\" \\ --set-hostname=\"susemanager.example.com\" --set-cname=\"example.com\" Ensure that the set-cname parameter is the fully qualified domain name of your Uyuni Server. You can use the the set-cname parameter multiple times if you require multiple aliases. The private key and the server certificate can be found in the directory /root/ssl-build/susemanager/ as server.key and server.crt. The name of the last directory depends on the hostname used with --set-hostname option. Be careful when you need to replace the Root CA. It is possible to break the trust chain between the server and clients. If that happens, you need an administrative user to log in to every client and deploy the CA directly. Procedure: Creating New Certificates On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, move the old certificate directory to a new location: mv /root/ssl-build /root/old-ssl-build Generate a new CA certificate: rhn-ssl-tool --gen-ca --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-common-name=\"SUSE Manager CA Certificate\" \\ --set-email=\"name@example.com\" Generate a new server certificate: rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-email=\"name@example.com\" \\ --set-hostname=\"susemanager.example.top\" --set-cname=\"example.com\" Ensure that the set-cname parameter is the fully qualified domain name of your Uyuni Server.

Every client that uses SSL to register to the Uyuni Server checks that it is connecting to the right server by validating against a server certificate. This process is called an SSL handshake. During the SSL handshake, the client checks that the hostname in the server certificate matches what it expects. The client also needs to check if the server certificate is trusted. Certificate authorities (CAs) are certificates that are used to sign other certificates. All certificates must be signed by a certificate authority (CA) in order for them to be considered valid, and for clients to be able to successfully match against them. In order for SSL authentication to work correctly, the client must trust the root CA. This means that the root CA must be installed on every client. The default method of SSL authentication is for Uyuni to use self-signed certificates. In this case, Uyuni has generated all the certificates, and the root CA has signed the server certificate directly. An alternative method is to use an intermediate CA. In this case, the root CA signs the intermediate CA. The intermediate CA can then sign any number of other intermediate CAs, and the final one signs the server certificate. This is referred to as a chained certificate. If you are using intermediate CAs in a chained certificate, the root CA is installed on the client, and the server certificate is installed on the server. During the SSL handshake, clients must be able to verify the entire chain of intermediate certificates between the root CA and the server certificate, so they must be able to access all the intermediate certificates. There are two main ways of achieving this. In older versions of Uyuni, by default, all the intermediate CAs are installed on the client. However, you could also configure your services on the server to provide them to the client. In this case, during the SSL handshake, the server presents the server certificate as well as all the intermediate CAs. This mechanims is used now as the new default configuration. By default, Uyuni uses a self-signed certificate without intermediate CAs. For additional security, you can arrange a third party CA to sign your certificates. Third party CAs perform checks to ensure that the information contained in the certificate is correct. They usually charge an annual fee for this service. Using a third party CA makes certificates harder to spoof, and provides additional protection for your installation. If you have certificates signed by a third party CA, you can import them to your Uyuni installation. This manual describe the use of SSL certificates in 2 steps How to create a self-signed certificate with Uyuni tools How to deploy a certificate on Uyuni Server or Proxy In case the certificates are provided by a third party instance like an own or external PKI, step 1 can be skipped.

Pin Clients to Subscriptions Your SUSE products require subscriptions, which are managed by the SUSE Customer Center (SCC). Uyuni runs a nightly report checking the subscription status of all your registered clients against your SCC account. The report gives you information about which clients consume which subscriptions, how many subscriptions you have remaining and available to use, and which clients do not have a current subscription. Navigate to Audit Subscription Matching to see the report. The Subscriptions Report tab gives information about current and expiring subscriptions. The Unmatched Products Report tab gives a list of clients that do not have a current subscription. This includes clients that could not be matched, or that are not currently registered with Uyuni. The report includes product names and the number of systems that remain unmatched. The Pins tab allows you to associate individual clients to the relevant subscription. This is especially useful if the subscription manager is not automatically associating clients to subscriptions successfully. The Messages tab shows all the messages generated by subscription matcher during the matching process. They provide information to help understand the results and to improve the matching. You can also download the reports in .csv format, or access them from that command prompt in the /var/lib/spacewalk/subscription-matcher/ directory. By default, the subscription matcher runs daily, at midnight. To change this, navigate to Admin Task Schedules and click gatherer-matcher-default. Change the schedule as required, and click Update Schedule. Because the report can only match current clients with current subscriptions, you might find that the matches change over time. The same client does not always match the same subscription. This can be due to new clients being registered or unregistered, or because of the addition or expiration of subscriptions. The subscription matcher automatically attempts to reduce the number of unmatched products, limited by the terms and conditions of the subscriptions in your account. However, if you have incomplete hardware information, unknown virtual machine host assignments, or clients running in unknown public clouds, the matcher might show that you do not have enough subscriptions available. Always ensure you have complete data about your clients included in Uyuni, to help ensure accuracy. The subscription matcher does not always match clients and subscriptions accurately. It is not intended to be a replacement for auditing. If the subscription matcher is not automatically matching a particular client with the correct subscription, you can manually pin them. When you have created a pin, the subscription matcher favors matching a specific subscription with a given system or group of systems. However, the matcher does not always respect a pin. It depends on the subscription being available, and whether or not the subscription can be applied to the client. Additionally, pins are ignored if they result in a match that violates the terms and conditions of the subscription, or if the matcher detects a more accurate match if the pin is ignored. To add a new pin, click Add a Pin, and select the client to pin. We do not recommend using pinning regularly, or for a large number of clients. The subscription matcher tool is generally accurate enough for most installations.","title":"Subscription Matching","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"subscription-matching","url":"/uyuni/administration/subscription-matching.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Uyuni Administrator Can perform all functions, including changing privileges of other users. Organization Administrator Manages activation keys, configurations, channels, and system groups. Activation Key Administrator Manages activation keys. Image Administrator Manages image profiles, builds, and stores. Configuration Administrator Manages system configuration. Channel Administrator Manages software channels, including making channels globally subscribable, and creating new channels. System Group Administrator Manages systems groups, including creating and deleting system groups, adding clients to existing groups, and managing user access to groups. If you have created system groups to manage your clients, you can assign groups to users for them to manage. To assign a user to a system group, navigate to Users User List, click the username to edit, and go to the System Groups tab. Check the groups to assign, and click btn:Update Defaults. You can also select one or more default system groups for a user. When the user registers a new client, it is assigned to the chosen system group by default. This allows the user to immediately access the newly registered client. To manage external groups, navigate to Users System Group Configuration, and go to the External Authentication tab. Click Create External Group to create a new external group. Give the group a name, and assign it to the appropriate system group. For more information about system groups, see System Groups. To see the individual clients a user can administer, navigate to Users User List, click the username to edit, and go to the Systems tab. To carry out bulk tasks, you can select clients from the list to add them to the system set manager. For more information about the system set manager, see System Set Manager. You can assign users to software channels within your organization either as a subscriber that consumes content from channels, or as an administrator, who can manage the channels themselves. To subscribe a user to a channel, navigate to Users User List, click the username to edit, and go to the Channel Permissions Subscription tab. Check the channels to assign, and click btn:Update Permissions. To grant a user channel management permissions, navigate to Users User List, click the username to edit, and go to the Channel Permissions Management tab. Check the channels to assign, and click btn:Update Permissions. Some channels in the list might not be subscribable. This is usually because of the users administrator status, or the channels global settings. When you create a new user, you can choose which language to use for the Web UI. After a user has been created, you can change the language by navigating to Home My Preferences. The default language is set in the rhn.conf configuration file. To change the default language, open the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf file and add or edit this line: web.locale = If the parameter is not set, the default language is en_US. These languages are available in Uyuni: Table 2.

Reactivation Keys 2. Activation Key Best Practices Activation keys are used to ensure that your clients have the correct software entitlements, are connecting to the appropriate channels, and are subscribed to the relevant groups. Each activation key is bound to an organization, which you can set when you create the key. In Uyuni, an activation key is a group of configuration settings with a label. You can apply all configuration settings associated with an activation key by adding its label as a parameter to a bootstrap script. We recommend you use an activation key label in combination with a bootstrap script. When the bootstrap script is executed all configuration settings associated with the label are applied to the system the script is run on. An activation key can specify: Channel assignment System types or add-on entitlements Contact method Configuration files Packages to be installed System group assignment Activation keys are used at the time a client is registered, and not used again. After the client has been registered, the client can be changed in any way, regardless of what the activation key specifies. The association between the activation key and the client is recorded only for historical purposes. Procedure: Creating an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, as an administrator, navigate to Systems Activation Keys. Click the Create Key button. On the Activation Key Details page, in the Description field, enter a description of the activation key. In the Key field, enter a name for the activation key. For example, SLES15-SP5 for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5. Do not use commas or double quotes in the Key field for any SUSE products. However, you must use commas for Red Hat Products. All other characters are allowed, but <> (){} (this includes the space) are removed automatically. If the field is left empty, a random string is generated. In the Base Channels drop-down box, select the appropriate base software channel, and allow the relevant child channels to populate. For more information, see reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc#vle.webui.admin.wizard.products and Custom Channels. Select the child channels you need (for example, the mandatory SUSE Manager tools and updates channels). Check the Add-On System Types check box if you need to enable any of the options. We recommend you leave the Contact Method set to Default. We recommend you leave the Universal Default setting unchecked. Click Create Activation Key to create the activation key. Check the Configuration File Deployment check box to enable configuration management for this key, and click Update Activation Key to save this change. The Configuration File Deployment check box does not appear until after you have created the activation key. Ensure you go back and check the box if you need to enable configuration management. Reactivation keys can be used once only to re-register a client and regain all Uyuni settings. Reactivation keys are client-specific, and include the system ID, history, groups, and channels. To create a reactivation key, navigate to Systems, click the client to create a reactivation key for, and navigate to the Details Reactivation tab. Click Generate New Key to create the reactivation key. Record the details of the key for later use. Unlike typical activation keys, which are not associated with a specific system ID, keys created here do not show up on the Systems Activation Keys page. After you have created a reactivation key, you can use it as the management_key grain in /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf. For example: grains: susemanager: management_key: \"re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e\" Restart the venv-salt-minion or salt-minion process to apply the reactivation key. You can use a reactivation key with a bootstrap script. For more information about bootstrap scripts, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. If you autoinstall a client with its existing Uyuni profile, the profile uses the reactivation key to re-register the system and restore its settings. Do not regenerate, delete, or use this key while a profile-based autoinstallation is in progress. Doing so causes the autoinstallation to fail. Default Parent Channel Avoid using the SUSE Manager Default parent channel. This setting forces Uyuni to choose a parent channel that best corresponds to the installed operating system, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, we recommend you create activation keys specific to each distribution and architecture. Bootstrapping with Activation Keys If you are using bootstrap scripts, consider creating an activation key for each script. This helps you align channel assignments, package installation, system group memberships, and configuration channel assignments. You also need less manual interaction with your system after registration. Bootstrapping LTSS clients If you are boostrapping clients with LTSS subscription, include the LTSS channels during activation key creation. Bandwidth Requirements Using activation keys might result in automatic downloading of software at registration time, which might not be desirable in environments where bandwidth is constrained. These options create bandwidth usage: Assigning a SUSE Product Pool channel results in the automatic installation of the corresponding product descriptor package. Any package in the Packages section is installed. Any Salt state from the Configuration section might trigger downloads depending on its contents. Key Label Naming If you do not enter a human-readable name for your activation keys, the system automatically generates a number string, which can make it difficult to manage your keys. Consider a naming scheme for your activation keys to help you keep track of them. Creating names which are associated with your organization’s infrastructure makes it easier for you when performing more complex operations. When creating key labels, consider these tips: OS naming (mandatory): Keys should always refer to the OS they provide settings for Architecture naming (recommended): Unless your company is running on one architecture only, for example x86_64, then providing labels with an architecture type is a good idea. Server type naming: What is this server being used for? Location naming: Where is the server located? Room, building, or department? Date naming: Maintenance windows, quarter, etc. Custom naming: What naming scheme suits your organizations needs? Example activation key label names: sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le Included Channels When creating activation keys you also need to keep in mind which software channels are associated with it. Keys should have a specific base channel assigned to them. Using the default base channel is not recommended.

Build a Red Hat ISO Image With Cobbler For clients that are not yet registered to Uyuni, and if network boot over PXE is not an option, a bootable CD-ROM or USB key can be used to install the system. One option to prepare such a removable medium is to use Cobbler. For information about using Cobbler to prepare an ISO image, see Build an ISO Image With Cobbler. For SUSE systems, it is often recommended to prepare an ISO image using KIWI. For more information, see Build a SUSE ISO Image With KIWI. In all cases, you use the resulting image to burn a CD-ROM or prepare a USB key. Cobbler can create ISO boot images that contain a set of distributions, kernels, and a menu that works in a similar way to a PXE installation. Building ISOs with Cobbler is not supported on IBM Z. In order to prepare an ISO image with Cobbler, you need to prepare a distribution and a profile, similar to using network boot over PXE. For information about creating a distribution, see Autoinstallable Distributions. For information about creating a profile, see Autoinstallation Profiles. The Cobbler buildiso command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO. Specifying the distribution with --distro is mandatory when running buildiso command. cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro= You must use distro and profile labels as listed by Cobbler, and not simply as shown in the UI. To list the names of distributions and profiles stored by Cobbler, run the commands: # cobbler distro list # cobbler profile list The boot ISO includes all profiles and systems by default. You can limit which profiles and systems are used with the --profiles and --systems options. For example: cobbler buildiso --systems=\"system1 system2 system3\" \\ --profiles=\" --distro= If you cannot write an ISO image to a public tmp directory, check your systemd settings in /usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.service. KIWI is an image creation system. You can use KIWI to create a bootable ISO image to be used by the target system for installation of a SUSE system. When the system is rebooted or switched on, it boots from the image, loads the AutoYaST configuration from your Uyuni, and installs SUSE Linux Enterprise Server according to the AutoYaST profile. To use the ISO image, boot the system and type autoyast at the prompt (assuming you left the label for the AutoYaST boot as autoyast). Press Enter to begin the AutoYaST installation. For more information about KIWI, see http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/.

Distribution Based on a RPM Package 3. Declare an Autoinstallable Distribution The autoinstallation process relies on an several files to initiate the installation. These files include the Linux kernel, an initial RAM disk, and other files required to boot the operating system in installation mode. You can extract the needed files from a DVD image. For information, see Distribution Based on an ISO Image. Alternatively, you can install the tftpboot-installation package. For information, see Distribution Based on a RPM Package. You must also have a base channel synchronized on your Uyuni Server for the same operating system version as those files. When you have the files ready, and the base channel synchronized, you need to declare the distribution. This operation associates the installation files to the base channel. The distribution can be referred to by one or more installation profiles. For information, see Declare an Autoinstallable Distribution. This method assumes you have installation media for the operating system you want to install on the clients. This is usually a DVD .iso image that contains the Linux kernel, an initrd file, and other files required to boot the operating system in installation mode. Procedure: Importing Files from Installation Media Copy the installation media to your Uyuni Server. For SUSE operating systems, you can download installation media from https://www.suse.com/download/. Loop-mount the ISO image, and copy its contents somewhere: # mount -o loop,ro .iso /mnt # mkdir -p /srv/www/distributions # cp -a /mnt /srv/www/distributions/ # umount /mnt Take a note of the file path. You will need it when you declare the distribution to Uyuni. This method works on SUSE systems. It is simpler than importing contents from an installation media, because it uses prepackaged files for your installation system. Procedure: Extracting Files from an Installation Package On the Uyuni Server, install the package whose name starts with tftpboot-installation. You can determine its exact name with the command zypper se tftpboot-installation Determine where the installation files went with the command ls -d /usr/share/tftpboot-installation/*. Take a note of the file path. You will need it when you declare the distribution to Uyuni. This procedure prepares the installation of the same operating system version as the one that powers your Uyuni Server. If you want to install a different operating system or version on the client, you need to manually get the package tftpboot-installation-* from the distribution it belongs to. In the Package Search input box Uyuni, search the packages whose names start with tftpboot-installation, then look at the package’s details. They show the local path below /var/spacewalk/. The next step after extracting the autoinstallation files is to declare an autoinstallable distribution. Procedure: Declaring an Autoinstallable Distribution In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions. Click Create Distribution, and complete these fields: In the Distribution Label field, enter a name to identify your autoinstallable distribution. In the Tree Path field, enter the path to the installation media saved on your Uyuni Server. Select the matching Base Channel. This must match the installation media. Select the Installer Generation. This must match the installation media. OPTIONAL: Specify kernel options to use when booting this distribution. There are multiple ways to provide kernel options. Only add options here that are generic for the distribution. Click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. The installation files that you prepared might not contain the packages you need to install. If they are not included, add useonlinerepo=1 to the Kernel Options field. The package repositories contain metadata that can be unsigned. If the metadata is unsigned, add insecure=1 to the Kernel Options field, or use your own GPG key as explained in Use Your Own GPG Key. These kernel options are needed for example when you use the \"online installer\" ISO images instead of the full DVD, or when you use the tpboot-installation package.

You might have installed these machines manually just before registering them to Uyuni, or they might be pre-existing systems that were installed before you added Uyuni to your environment. Alternatively, you can use Uyuni to help you install an operating system and register it to Uyuni in one go. This method is partially or totally automated, so you can save time answering installer questions, and is especially useful if you have many clients you want to install and register. There are several ways to install an operating system from Uyuni: in-place, on clients that are already registered; over the network, using PXE boot; preparing an installation CD-ROM or an USB key, and then going to the machine to boot on that medium; as part of the Uyuni for Retail solution. The in-place reinstallation method assumes that a previous operating system has already been installed on the client, and that the client has already been registered to Uyuni. For information about the in-place installation method, see Reinstall Registered Systems. The network boot installation method works on unformatted machines. However, it can only be performed in certain network configurations: the Uyuni Server, or one of its proxies, are on the same local network as the machine you want to install, or you have a DHCP relay that allows you to cross all routers in between; you are able to set up a new DHCP server or to configure an existing one; the client to install is able to boot with PXE, and you can configure it to do so. For information about the network boot method, see Install via the Network. The removable medium method allows you to bypass these network constraints. However, it assumes the machine is able to read CD-ROMs or USB keys, and boot from them. It also requires physical access to the client machine. For information about the removable media method, see Install via a CD-ROM or a USB key. For information about the Uyuni for Retail approach, see Retail Guide. Autoinstallation of Ubuntu and Debian clients is not supported. These operating systems must be installed manually. The autoinstallation features of Uyuni are based on a software named Cobbler. For more information about Cobbler, see https://cobbler.readthedocs.io. SUSE only supports Cobbler functions that are available in the Uyuni Web UI, or through the Uyuni API. The sole command-line command supported by Cobbler is buildiso. Only supported features are documented here.","title":"Operating System Installation","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-intro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-intro.html","titles":[]},"52":{"id":52,"text":"Table of Contents 1. Own GPG Key for PXE Boot 2. Own GPG key in a CD-ROM If the repositories you are using for autoinstallation have unsigned metadata, you usually have to use the insecure=1 kernel parameter as an option of the autoinstallable distribution, and use a spacewalk/sles_no_signature_checks code snippet in the AutoYaST installation file. A safer alternative is to provide your own GPG key. This technique applies to SUSE clients only. Procedure: Include your own GPG key Create a GPG key. Use it to sign the package’s metadata. Add it to the initial RAM disk of your installation media. For information on how to create the key and sign the metadata with it, see Signing Repository Metadata. For information on how to add the key to installation media used for network boot, see Own GPG Key for PXE Boot. For information on how to add the key to installation media used for a boot from CD-ROM, see Own GPG Key in a CD-ROM. When you signed the metadata with your new GPG key, any already onboarded client will not know about the new key. Ideally, you should sign the metadata before you register any client. For already onboarded clients that use those repositories, the workaround is to disable GPG key checking on them. The initial RAM disk (initrd) used by PXE boot process normally contains SUSE’s GPG key only. You must add our own key to this file, so it can be used to check the packages. Procedure: Add a GPG key to the initial RAM disk Create a directory with a path identical to the one that is used during the boot process to find the GPG key: mkdir -p tftproot/usr/lib/rpm/gnupg/keys Copy your GPG key into this directory with the suffix .asc: cp /srv/www/htdocs/pub/mgr-gpg-pub.key tftproot/usr/lib/rpm/gnupg/keys/mgr-gpg-pub.asc Inside the top level directory, package the content and append it to the initrd that is part of your installation media files: cd tftproot find . | cpio -o -H newc | xz --check=crc32 -c >> /path/to/initrd You can modify an installation image with the mksusecd utility.

AutoYaST Profiles 3. Kickstart profiles 4. Templates syntax 4.1. Variables 4.2. Code snippets 4.3. Escaping An autoinstallation profile determines how the operating system will be installed. For example, you can specify additional kernel parameters to be passed to the installer. The most important part of the profile is the \"autoinstallation file.\" When you perform an installation manually, you must provide information to the installer, such as partitioning and networking information and user details. The autoinstallation file is a method of providing this information in a scripted form. This type of file is sometimes also referred to as an \"answers file.\" Within Uyuni, you can use two different types of profiles, depending on the operating system of the clients you want to install: For SUSE Linux Enterprise or openSUSE clients, use AutoYaST. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients, use Kickstart. You can use both AutoYaST and Kickstart profiles if you want to install clients with different operating systems. For information about how to declare profiles, see Declare the Profile For information about AutoYaST profiles, see AutoYaST Profiles. For information about Kickstart profiles, see Kickstart Profiles. The autoinstallation file contained in the profile can include variables and code snippets. For information about variables and code snippets, see Templates Syntax. When you have prepared an autoinstallation file and distribution, you can create profiles to manage autoinstallation on your Uyuni Server. The profile will determine how to install this distribution you selected. One way to create a profile is to upload an AutoYaST or Kickstart file. Alternatively, for Kickstart only, you can use the Web UI wizard. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallation Profile by Upload In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles. Click Upload Kickstart/AutoYaST File. In the Label field, type a name for the profile. Do not use spaces. In the Autoinstall Tree field, select the autoinstallable distribution to use for this profile. In the Virtualization Type field, select the type of virtualization to use for this profile, or select None if you do not want to use this profile to create a new virtual machine. Copy the contents of your autoinstallation file into the File Contents field, or upload the file directly using the File to Upload field. For more information about the details to include here, see AutoYaST Profiles or Kickstart Profiles. Click Create to create the profile. Procedure: Creating a Kickstart Profile by Wizard In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles. Click Create Kickstart Profile. In the Label field, type a name for the profile. Do not use spaces. In the Base Channel field, select the base channel to use for this profile. This field is populated from the distributions available. If the base channel you need is not available, check that you have created the distribution correctly. In the Virtualization Type field, select the type of virtualization to use for this profile, or select None for no virtualization. Click Next. In the Distribution File Location type the path to the installation media installed on the Uyuni Server. Click Next. Provide a password for the root user on the client. Click Finish. Review the details of your new profile, and customize as required. When you are creating your autoinstallation profile, you can check Always use the newest Tree for this base channel. This setting allows Uyuni to automatically pick the latest distribution that is associated with the specified base channel. If you add new distributions later, Uyuni uses the most recently created or modified. Changing the Virtualization Type usually requires changes to the profile bootloader and partition options. This can overwrite your customization. Verify new or changed settings before saving them, by navigating to the Partitioning tab. The kernel options from the distribution and the profile are combined. You can change the details and settings of your autoinstallation profiles by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and clicking the name of the profile you want to edit. Alternatively, navigate to Systems System List, select the client you want to provision, and navigate to the Provisioning Autoinstallation subtab. An AutoYaST profile consists of a Label that identifies the profile, an Autoinstall Tree that points to an autoinstallable distribution, various options, and, most importantly, an AutoYaST installation file. The AutoYaST installation file is an XML file that give directions to the AutoYaST installer. AutoYaST calls it a \"control file.\" For the full syntax of AutoYaST installation files, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#cha-configuration-installation-options. SUSE provides templates of AutoYaST installation files that you can use as a starting point for your own custom files. You will find the templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles in the AutoYast directory. Each of these profiles requires you to set some variables before you use it. Check the README file included with the script to determine which variables you need. For more information about using variables in AutoYaST scripts, see Variables. These are the most important sections in the AutoYaST installation file for installing with Uyuni: allows to add child channels to the installation. For an example, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#Software-Selections-additional. `$SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_no_signature_checks') disables signature checks allows to specify product for the Unified Installer See https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#CreateProfile-Software with a \"\" example $SNIPPET('spacewalk/minion_script') allows the client to register to Uyuni as a Salt client. For more information about AutoYaST, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/. A more recent, Salt-based alternative to AutoYaST, is Yomi. For information about Yomi, see Install with Yomi. Kickstart profiles offer a large number of configuration options. To create these profiles, you can upload them, or use a dedicated wizard. Kickstart profiles allow you to use file preservation lists. If you have many custom configuration files located on a client you want to reinstall with Kickstart, you can save them as a list, and associate that list with the Kickstart profile. Procedure: Creating a file preservation list In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation File Preservation and click Create File Preservation List. Enter a suitable label, and list absolute paths to all files and directories you want to save. Click Create List. Include the file preservation list in your Kickstart profile. Navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and select the profile you want to edit, go to the System Details File Preservation subtab, and select the file preservation list to include. File preservation lists are limited to a total size of 1 MB. Special devices like /dev/hda1 and /dev/sda1 cannot be preserved. Only use file and directory names, you cannot use regular expression wildcards. For more information about Kickstart, see the Red Hat documentation. Parts of your installation file are replaced during the installation. Variables are replaced with single values, and code snippets are replaced with whole sections of text. Escaped symbols or sections are not replaced. A template engine called Cheetah allows Cobbler to do these replacements. This mechanism allows you to reinstall large numbers of systems, without having to manually create profiles for each of them. You can create autoinstallation variables and code snippets within the Uyuni Web UI. Within a profile, the Autoinstallation File tab allows you to see the result of the substitutions. For information about variables, see Variables. For information about code snippets, see Code Snippets. For information about escaping symbols or text blocks, see Escaping. Autoinstallation variables can be used to substitute values into Kickstart and AutoYaST profiles. To define a variable, from the profile, navigate to the Variables subtab, and create a name=value pair in the text box. For example, you could create a variable that holds the IP address of the client, and another that holds the address of its gateway. Those variables can then be defined for all the clients installed from the same profile. To do that, add these lines to the Variables text box: ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 To use the variable, prepend a $ sign in the profile to substitute the value. For example, the network part of a Kickstart file may look like the following: network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway The $ipaddr is resolved to 192.168.0.28, and the $gateway to 192.168.0.1. In installation files, variables use a hierarchy. System variables take precedence over profile variables, which in turn take precedence over distribution variables. Uyuni comes with a large number of predefined code snippets. Navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Autoinstallation Snippets to see the list of existing snippets. Use a snippet by inserting the $SNIPPET() macro in your autoinstallation file. For example, in Kickstart: $SNIPPET('spacewalk/rhel_register_script') Or, in AutoYaST: $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script') The macro is parsed by Cobbler and substituted with the contents of the snippet. You can also store your own code snippets to use in autoinstallation files later on. Click Create Snippet to create a new code snippet. This example sets up a Kickstart snippet for a common hard drive partition configuration: clearpart --all part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary part swap --recommended part pv.00 --size=1 --grow volgroup vg00 pv.00 logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000 Use the snippet with, for example: $SNIPPET('my_partition') If the autoinstallation file contains shell script variables like $(example), the content needs to be escaped with a backslash: \\$(example). Escaping the $ symbol prevents the templating engine from evaluating the symbol as an internal variable. Text blocks such as code fragments or scripts can be escaped by wrapping them with the \\#raw and \\#end raw directives. For example: #raw #!/bin/bash for i in {0..2}; do echo \"$i - Hello World!\" done #end raw Any line with a # symbol followed by a whitespace is treated as a comment and is therefore not evaluated. For example: # start some section (this is a comment) echo \"Hello, world\" # end some section (this is a comment)","title":"Autoinstallation Profiles","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-profiles","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-profiles.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

GRUB EFI binary names for different architectures During a network boot installation: The client boots in PXE mode. A DHCP server provides the client with an IP address and mask, the address of an installation server, and the name of a bootloader file on that server. The client downloads the bootloader file via the TFTP protocol from the installation server and executes it. The client is presented with a choice of possible profiles to install from a menu, or starts automatically installing one of the profiles. The client downloads via the TFTP protocol a kernel and an initial RAM disk for the distribution matching that profile. The installation kernel starts an installation program, either Kickstart or AutoYaST. From now on it uses resources provided on the server via the HTTP protocol. The distribution is installed automatically according to the Kickstart or AutoYaST profile. The profile calls a code snippet that registers the client to the Uyuni Server. The installation server can either be the Uyuni Server or one of its proxies. To install from a proxy, you must synchronize the TFTP tree between the server and the proxy before you begin. The DHCP server may also provide other configuration information to the client, like a host name, the address of a router and the address of a domain name server. Some of this information might be needed for the autoinstallation, for example if you specify the installation server by its domain name. In the PXE boot menu, the first choice is Local boot. If you select this, the boot process continues from the local disk drives. This option is selected automatically if no profile was selected after a certain time. This is a security measure to prevent from starting an autoinstallation if no human operator is there to select one of the profiles. Alternatively, the installation can start automatically from one of the profiles without manual intervention. This is called \"unattended provisioning.\" The \"bare metal\" functionality is a kind of unattended provisioning based on PXE boot. In this scenario, the bootloader file only registers the client at the Uyuni Server and does not start the installation. You can then trigger an in-place reinstallation later. Procedure: Installing with PXE Boot Prepare the DHCP server, see Prepare the DHCP Server. Prepare an autoinstallable distribution, see Autoinstallable Distributions. Prepare an autoinstallation profile, see Autoinstallation Profiles. Reboot the client, and chose a profile to install. Some other steps are optional. To use a proxy as the installation server, see Synchronize the TFTP Tree with Proxies. For unattended provisioning, see Unattended Provisioning. The PXE boot process uses DHCP to find the TFTP server. The Uyuni Server or its proxies can act as such a TFTP server. You must have administrative access to the network’s DHCP server. Edit the DHCP configuration file so that it points to the installation server as the TFTP boot server. Example: Configuring the ISC DHCP Server On the DHCP server, as root, open the /etc/dhcpd.conf file. Modify the declaration for your client: host myclient { (...) next-server 192.168.2.1; filename \"pxelinux.0\"; } Save the file and restart the dhcpd service. This example directs the PXE client myclient to the installation server at 192.168.2.1 and instructs it to retrieve the pxelinux.0 bootloader file. Alternatively, if your DHCP server is registered at Uyuni, you can configure it using the DHCPd formula instead: Example: Configuring the ISC DHCP Server Using the DHCPd Formula Navigate to Systems System List, select the client you want to change, and go to the Formulas tab to enable the DHCPd formula. Go to the formula’s Dhcpd tab, and in the Next Server field, enter the hostname or IP address of the installation server. In the Filename EFI field, type grub/shim.efi to enable EFI PXE support. In the Filename field, type pxelinux.0 to enable legacy BIOS support. Click Save Formula to save your configuration. Apply the highstate. If you do not use Secure Boot, type grub/grubx86.efi instead of grub/shim.efi in the Filename EFI field. For different architectures, see table GRUB EFI binary names for different architectures. Using Cobbler managed DHCP is unsupported with Uyuni. This sets up a global PXE server for all the hosts, you can also have per-host settings. For more information about the DHCPd formula, see DHCPd Formula. You can synchronize the TFTP tree on the Uyuni Server with the Uyuni Proxy. For synchronization, HTTPS port 443 must be open. Every added proxy slows down the tree synchronization. Procedure: Synchronizing TFTP between Server and Proxy On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync package: zypper install susemanager-tftpsync On the Uyuni Proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper install susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, as root, run the configure-tftpsync.sh script. The script interactively asks you for details on the host names and IP addresses of the Uyuni Server and Proxy, as well for the location of the tftpboot directory on the Proxy. For more information, use the configure-tftpsync.sh --help command. On the server, as root, run the configure-tftpsync.sh script. configure-tftpsync.sh proxy1.example.com proxy2.example.com Run the cobbler sync command on the server to push the files to the proxy. This fails if you have not configured the proxies correctly. If you want to change the list of proxies later on, you can use the configure-tftpsync.sh script to edit them. If you reinstall an already configured proxy and want to push all the files again, you must remove the cache file at /var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json before you call cobbler sync. Table 1.

Bare Metal Provisioning 2. Create a System Record Manually The \"bare metal\" functionality allows you to register any new machine as soon as it connects to the local network, using a generic PXE boot image. You then go to Uyuni Web UI and assign a profile to this machine. The next time the client boots, the operating system is installed according to that profile. For information about the bare metal provisioning, see Bare Metal Provisioning. If you do not want to use the bare metal functionality, you can still declare manually the system at Uyuni. The Uyuni API allows you to create system records for systems as if they were collected by the bare metal functionality. For information about declaring systems with the API, see Create a System Record Manually. When you have the bare metal provisioning option enabled, any client connected to the Uyuni network is automatically added to the organization as soon as it is powered on. When this operation is complete, the client is shut down, and it appears in the Systems list, ready to be installed. Procedure: Enable the Bare Metal Functionality In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Manager Configuration Bare-metal systems. Click Enable adding to this organization. New clients that are powered on are added to the organization that belongs to the administrator who enabled the bare metal feature. They are of \"bootstrap\" type, and still need to be provisioned to become regular clients. To change the organization new clients are added to, disable the bare metal feature, log in as the administrator of the new organization, and then re-enable the feature. You can migrate already registered systems to other organizations, using the Migrate tab. You can use the system set manager (SSM) with clients that are registered that way. However, not all SSM features are available for those clients, because they do not yet have an operating system installed. This also applies to mixed sets that include systems registered that way. All features become available to the set when all the clients in the set have been provisioned. For more information on SSM, see System Set Manager. Procedure: Provision \"Bootstrap\" Type clients In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems, select the client to provision, and go to the Provisioning Autoinstallation tab. Select the AutoYaST profile to use, and click Create PXE installation configuration. This option creates a system entry at Cobbler. Power on the client. The server uses TFTP to provision the new client, so the appropriate port and networks must be configured correctly for provisioning to be successful. You can use an API call to declare an association between a client identified by its MAC address and an autoinstallation profile. Next time the system reboots, it starts the installation based on the specified profile. Procedure: Reinstallation From a Manually Declared Profile On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, use the system.createSystemRecord API call. In this example, replace name with the name of your client, with the profile label, with the name of the interface on the client such as eth0, and with its hardware address such as 00:25:22:71:e7:c6: $ spacecmd api -- --args '[\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \\ [ {\"name\": \"\", \"mac\": \"\"} ]]' \\ system.createSystemRecord Power on the client. It boots from the network, and the correct profile is selected for installation. This command creates a system record at Cobbler.

Registration can be achieved in two ways: cloud-init based registration remote execution provisioner based registration Registering by leveraging cloud-init is the preferred way of automatic registering of the newly created virtual machines. This solution avoids configuring an SSH connection to the host. It can also be used regardless of the tool used for client creation. User can pass the set of user data when deploying the image with Terraform, to automatically register the machine to Uyuni. user_data is run only once at bootstrap, and only the first time the machine is started. Before using cloud-init to register clients, the user must configure: Bootstrap script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. Activation keys. For more information, see Activation Keys. The following command will download the bootstrap script and register the new machine when it is created. It should be added to the cloud-init configuration: curl -s http://hub-server.tf.local/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-default.sh | bash -s Anytime user_data is updated to change the provisioning, Terraform will destroy and then recreate the machines with a new IP, etc. For more information about cloud-init on AWS, see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/template/latest/docs/data-sources/cloudinit_config. For a cloud-init example, see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/cloudinit/latest/docs/data-sources/cloudinit_config#example-usage. The second solution for automatic registering of the newly created virtual machines uses Terraform’s remote-exec provisioner. remote-exec provisioner interacts with the newly created machines. It opens an SSH connection and can run commands on that machine. When using remote-exec provisioner to register clients, the user must ensure that the machine running Terraform will have access to the new virtual machine after its creation. The remaining requirements are the same as when using cloud-init based client registration: Bootstrap script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. Activation keys. For more information, see Activation Keys. The following command will download the bootstrap script and register the new machine when it is created. It should be defined as the remote command to run: curl -s http://hub-server.tf.local/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-default.sh | bash -s For more information about remote-exec provisioner, see https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/remote-exec.html.","title":"Automatic registration of clients created by Terraform","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"automatic-client-registration","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/automatic-client-registration.html","titles":[{"text":"1. cloud-init based client registration","hash":"cloud-init-based-client-registration","id":1},{"text":"2. remote-exec provisioner based registration","hash":"remote-exec-provisioner-based-client-registration","id":2}]},"58":{"id":58,"text":"Table of Contents 1. Prepare to Create a Bootstrap Repository 2. Options for Automatic Mode 2.1. Configure Bootstrap Data File 3. Manually Generate a Bootstrap Repository 3.1. Repositories with Multiple Architectures 4. Bootstrap and Custom Channels A bootstrap repository contains required packages for registering clients during bootstrapping. When products are synchronized, bootstrap repositories are automatically created and regenerated on the Uyuni Server. When you select a product for synchronization, the bootstrap repository is automatically created as soon as all mandatory channels are fully mirrored. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You can change how the automated bootstrap repository creation works. This section details the various settings. Flush Mode:: Flush Mode By default, existing repositories are updated only with the latest packages. You can configure it to always start with an empty repository instead. To enable this behavior, add or edit this value in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_flush = 1 Automatic Mode:: Automatic Mode By default, automated regeneration of the bootstrap repositories is enabled. To disable it, add or edit this value in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: server.susemanager.auto_generate_bootstrap_repo = 0 The tool uses a data file with information about which packages are required for each distribution. The data file is stored at /usr/share/susemanager/mgr_bootstrap_data.py. SUSE updates this file regularly. If you want to makes changes to this file, do not edit it directly. Instead, create a copy in the same directory and edit your copy: cd /usr/share/susemanager/ cp mgr_bootstrap_data.py my_data.py When you have made your changes, configure Uyuni to use the new file. Add or edit this value in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: server.susemanager.bootstrap_repo_datamodule = my_data On the next update, the new data from SUSE overwrites the original data file, not the new one. You need to keep the new file up to date with changes provided by SUSE. By default, bootstrap repositories are regenerated daily. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt. Procedure: Generating the Bootstrap Repository for SUSE Linux Enterprise At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, list the available distributions to create bootstrap repositories for: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -l Create the bootstrap repository, using the appropriate repository name as the product label: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-version-x86_64 Alternatively, use the number shown next to the distribution name in the list of available distributions. The client repository is located in /srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/. If you have mirrored more than one product (for example, SLES and SLES for SAP), or if you use custom channels, you might need to specify the parent channel to use when creating the bootstrap repository. This is not required in every situation. For example, some SLES 15 versions have common code bases, so there is no need to specify a parent channel. Use this procedure only if your environment requires it. OPTIONAL Procedure: Specifying a Parent Channel for a Bootstrap Repository Check which parent channels you have available: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 Multiple options for parent channel found. Please use option --with-parent-channel and choose one of: - sle-product-sles15-pool-x86_64 - sle-product-sles_sap15-pool-x86_64 - sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64 Specify the appropriate parent channel: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-x86_64 --with-parent-channel sle-product-sled15-pool-x86_64 If you are creating bootstrap repositories that include multiple different architectures, you need to be careful that all architectures are updated correctly. For example, the x86-64 and IBM Z architectures for SLE use the same bootstrap repository URL at /srv/www/htdocs/pub/repositories/sle/15/2/bootstrap/. When the flush option is enabled, and you attempt to generate the bootstrap repository for multiple architectures, only one architecture is generated. To avoid this, use the --no-flush option at the command prompt when creating additional architectures. For example: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo -c SLE-15-SP2-x86_64 mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --no-flush -c SLE-15-SP2-s390x If you are using custom channels, you can use the --with-custom-channels option with the mgr-create-bootstrap-repo command. In this case, you also need to specify the parent channel to use. Automatic creation of a bootstrap repository might fail if you are using custom channels. In this case, you need to create the repository manually.

Packages Provided by EPEL 4. Unified Installer Updates Channels on SUSE Linux Enterprise Clients Channels are a method of grouping software packages. Software packages are provided by repositories, and repositories are associated with channels. Subscribing a client to a software channel allows the client to install and update any of the software associated with it. In Uyuni, channels are divided into base channels and child channels. Organizing channels in this way ensures that only compatible packages are installed on each system. A client must be subscribed to only one base channel, assigned during registration based on the client operating system and architecture. For paid channels provided by a vendor, you must have an associated subscription. A base channel consists of packages built for a specific operating system type, version, and architecture. For example, the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86-64 base channel contains only software compatible with that operating system and architecture. A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides only packages that are compatible with the base channel. A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel. When a system has been assigned to a base channel, it is only possible for that system to install the related child channels. For example, if a system has been assigned to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86_64 base channel, they can only install or update packages made available through the compatible base channel, or any of its associated child channels. In the Uyuni Web UI you can browse your available channels by navigating to Software Channel List All. You can modify or create new channels by navigating to Software Manage Channels. For more on using channels, including custom channels, see Channel management. SUSE Package Hub is an extension to SUSE Linux Enterprise products that provides additional open source software provided by the openSUSE community. The packages in SUSE Package Hub are provided by the openSUSE community. They are not supported by SUSE. If you are using SUSE Linux Enterprise operating systems on your clients, you can enable the SUSE Package Hub extension to access these additional packages. This provides the SUSE Package Hub channels, which you can subscribe your clients to. SUSE Package Hub provides a large number of packages, which can take a long time to synchronize and consume a large amount of disk space. Do not enable SUSE Package Hub unless you require the packages it provides. To avoid unintentionally installing or updating unsupported packages, we recommend that you implement a content lifecycle management strategy that initially denies all SUSE Package Hub packages. You can then explicitly enable the specific packages you require. For more information about content lifecycle management, see Content Lifecycle Management. For Red Hat based clients, additional packages are available through AppStream. In most cases, the AppStream packages are required to ensure that you have all the software you need. When you are managing AppStream packages in the Uyuni Web UI, you might notice that you see contradicting suggestions for package updates. This is due to the Uyuni not being able to interpret the modular metadata correctly. You can use the content lifecycle management (CLM) AppStream filter to transform AppStream repositories into non-modular repositories for use with some upgrade operations. For more information about the CLM AppStream filters, see Content Lifecycle Management Examples. For Red Hat based clients, additional packages are available through EPEL (extra packages for enterprise Linux). EPEL is an optional package repository that provides additional software. The packages in EPEL are provided by the Fedora community. They are not supported by SUSE. If you are using Red Hat operating systems on your clients, you can enable the EPEL extension to access these additional packages. This provides the EPEL channels, which you can subscribe your clients to. EPEL provides a large number of packages, which can take a long time to synchronize and consume a large amount of disk space.

This channel is used by the Unified Installer to ensure it is up to date before it installs the operating system. All SUSE Linux Enterprise products should have access to the installer updates channel during installation. For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server clients the installer updates channel is synchronized by default when you add a product that contains them, and are enabled when you create an autoinstallable distribution with these product channels. For all other SUSE Linux Enterprise variants, including SUSE Linux Enterprise for SAP, you must add the installer updates channel manually. To do this, clone the appropriate SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installer updates channel below the base channel of these SUSE Linux Enterprise variants. When creating an autoinstallable distribution for these SUSE Linux Enterprise variants after the channel was cloned, it is used automatically.","title":"Software Channels","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"channels","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Registering clients to a proxy is similar to registering them directly to the Uyuni Server, with a few key differences. These sections contain information on registering clients to a proxy using the Web UI, commands on the command line, or a bootstrap script. There are also procedures how you can move clients from one Uyuni Proxy to another one or to the Uyuni Server. Within the Web UI, proxy pages show information about clients. You can see a list of clients that are connected to a proxy by clicking the name of the proxy in Systems System List Proxy, then select the Proxy subtab of the Details tab. A list of chained proxies for a client can be seen by clicking the name of the client in Systems All, then select the Connection subtab of the Details tab. You can move Salt and Salt SSH push clients between proxies without the need to repeat the registration process. You cannot move chained proxies. Instead of moving a chained proxy, create a new proxy, move the clients, and delete the old proxy. Procedure: Moving Salt or Salt SSH Push Client between Proxies In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the System Details page for the client you want to move between proxies. Navigate to the Connection tab. Then follow the Change proxy link to see the drop-down menu. From the New Proxy drop-down menu select the proxy you want the client to move to, and click Change Proxy. Procedure: Moving Multiple Salt or Salt SSH Push Clients between Proxies with SSM In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and check each client to move, this adds the clients to the system set manager. Navigate to Systems System Set Manager, and go to the Misc Proxy`` tab. From the New Proxy drop-down menu select the proxy you want the clients to move to, and click Change Proxy. The same functionality is also available with the system.changeProxy API call. The effect of this function differs between normal Salt clients and Salt SSH push clients. The function schedules a Salt state action, which modifies master: setting in the susemanager.conf Salt client configuration file to point to the new proxy. Then the function restarts the Salt client. Changing master: by manually editing the susemanager.conf file has the same effect and is supported, too. When the client restarts and reconnects via the new proxy, the server updates the proxy path in the database and schedules another action for refreshing the channel URLs. The function updates the proxy path immediately in the database and new action for refreshing the channel URLs is scheduled. If you want to move a Salt client from a proxy to the server, select None from proxy list.","title":"Register Clients to a Proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"client-proxy","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/client-proxy.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Upgrade When you have many SUSE Linux Enterprise Server clients to manage, you can automate in-place upgrades using the content lifecycle manager. Before you can upgrade your clients, you need to make these preparations: Create a content lifecycle project Create an activation key Create an autoinstallable distribution Create an autoinstallation profile Procedure: Creating a Content Lifecycle Project Create a content lifecycle project for your distribution. For more information, see Content Lifecycle Management. Ensure you a choose a short but descriptive name for your project. Include all source channel modules that you require for your distribution. Add filters as required, and set up at least one environment. Procedure: Creating an Activation Key Create an activation key for your distribution. For more information, see Activation Keys. Ensure your activation key includes all filtered project channels. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallable Distribution Create an autoinstallable distribution for every base channel you want to migrate. For more information, see Autoinstallable Distributions. Give your distribution a label that references the name of the content lifecycle project. In the Installer Generation field, select the SLES version you are using. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallation Profile Create an autoinstallation profile for every target distribution and service pack you want to upgrade to. For more information, see Autoinstallation Profiles. You can use variables in the profile to distinguish between the different lifecycle environments. For example autoinstallation profiles, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/AutoYaST. Use these variables in your autointallation profiles for automating in-place upgrades: Listing 1. Example: Variables for Use in Autoinstallation Profiles registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distro_label=15sp1-demo-test Listing 2. Example: Entry for Use in Autoinstallation Profiles true https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-module-web-scripting15-sp1-pool-x86_64/$distro_label $channel_prefix SLE-Module-Web-Scripting15-SP1 Pool for x86_64 Web Scripting Module 15 SP1 x86_64 Pool When you have prepared the server for the upgrade, you can provision the clients. Procedure: Provisioning the Clients In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List, and select the clients you want to provision to add them to the system set manager. Navigate to Systems System Set Manager Overview and click the Provisioning tab. Select the autoinstallation profile to use. For clients that are able to use PXE, the migration is automated as soon as you have provisioned them. For all other clients, you can use Cobbler to perform the upgrade. Procedure: Using Cobbler to Upgrade Clients At the command prompt, as root, check the available Cobbler profiles: cobbler profile list Build the ISO file with your chosen profile and distribution: cobbler buildiso --iso=/tmp/SLE_15-sp1.iso --profiles=SLE_15-sp1:1:Example --distro=SLE_15-sp1 For more information about using CD-ROMs to provision clients, see Install via a CD-ROM or a USB Key.","title":"Upgrade Using the Content Lifecycle Manager","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"client-upgrades-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/client-upgrades-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Create an autoinstallation profile 3. Migration Your clients must have the latest available service pack (SP) for the installed operating system, with all the latest updates applied. Before you start, ensure that the system is up to date and all updates have been installed successfully. The upgrade is controlled by YaST and AutoYaST, it does not use Zypper. Before you can migrate your client from SLE 12 to SLE 15 , you need to: Procedure Prepare installation media Create an auto-installable distribution Create an activation key Upload an AutoYaST profile Procedure: Preparing installation media (for example, SLE 15 SP2) On the Uyuni Server, create a local directory for the SLE 15 SP2 installation media: mkdir -p /srv/images/sle15sp2 Download an ISO image with the installation sources, and mount the ISO image on your server: mount -o loop DVD1.iso /mnt/ Copy everything from the mounted ISO to your local file system: cp -r /mnt/* /srv/images/sle15sp2 When the copy is complete, unmount the ISO image: umount /mnt This image is the Unified Installer and can be used for multiple autoinstallable distributions. Procedure: Creating an autoinstallable distribution In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions and click Create Distribution. In the Create Autoinstallable Distribution section, use these parameters: In the Distribution Label section, type a unique name for the distribution. Use only letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores, and ensure the name is longer than four characters. For example, sles15sp2-x86_64. In the Tree Path field, type an absolute path to the installation source. For example, /srv/images/sle15sp2. In the Base Channel field, select SLE-Product-SLES15-SP2-Pool for x86_64. In the Installer Generation field, select SUSE Linux Enterprise 15. In the Kernel Options field, type any options to be passed to the kernel when booting for the installation. The install= parameter and the self_update=0 pt.options=self_update parameter are added by default. In the Post Kernel Options section, type any options to be passed to the kernel when booting the installed system for the first time. Click Create Autoinstallable Distribution to save. To switch from the old SLE 12 base channel to the new SLE 15 channel, you need an activation key. Procedure: Creating an activation key In the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys and click Create Key. Enter a description for your key. Enter a key or leave it blank to generate an automatic key. OPTIONAL: If you want to limit the usage, enter your value in the Usage text field. Select the SLE-Product-SLES15-SP2-Pool for x86_64 base channel. OPTIONAL: Select any Add-On System Types. For more information, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/article-modules.html. Click Create Activation Key. Click the Child Channels tab and select the required channels. Click Update Key. Autoinstallation profiles contain all the installation and configuration data needed to install a system. They can also contain scripts to be executed after the installation is complete. For example scripts that you can use as a starting point, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/AutoYaST. For valid AutoYaST upgrade settings, see https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/autoyast/#CreateProfile-upgrade. Procedure: Creating an autoinstallation profile In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and upload your autoinstallation profile script. For example scripts that you can use as a starting point, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/AutoYaST. In the Kernel Options field, type autoupgrade=1. Optionally, you can also include the Y2DEBUG=1 option. The debug setting is not required but can help with investigating any future problems you might encounter. Clients running in Azure cloud must add textmode=1 console=ttyS0 to Kernel Options. Paste the autoinstallation profile or use the file upload field. Click Create to save. When the uploaded profile requires variables to be set, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles, select the profile to edit, and navigate to the Variables tab. Specify the required variables, using this format: = Before you begin, check that all the channels referenced in the autoinstallation profile are available and fully synchronized. You can monitor the mirroring progress in /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log. Procedure: Migrating In the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems and select the client to be upgraded. Navigate to the Provisioning tab, and select the autoinstallation profile you uploaded. Click Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish. The system downloads the required files, change the bootloader entries, reboot, and start the upgrade. Next time the client synchronizes with the Uyuni Server, it receives a re-installation job. The re-installation job fetches the new kernel and initrd packages. It also writes a new /boot/grub/menu.lst (GRUB Legacy) or /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (GRUB 2), containing pointers to the new kernel and initrd packages. When the client next boots, it uses grub to boot the new kernel with its initrd. PXE booting is not used during this process. Approximately three minutes after the job was fetched, the client goes down for reboot. For clients, use the spacewalk/minion_script snippet to register the client again after migration has completed.","title":"Client - Major version upgrade","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"client-upgrades-major","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/client-upgrades-major.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Example: SLES 15 SP2 to SLES 15 SP3 2.2.1. Mandatory Syntax Explained Product migration allows you to upgrade SLE-based client systems from an Service Pack (SP) level to a later one. For example, you can migrate SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2. Product migration is for upgrading within the same major version. You cannot use product migration to migrate from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15. For more information about major upgrades, see Client - Major version upgrade. You can also migrate openSUSE Leap to a later minor version or to the corresponding SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SP level, for example: openSUSE Leap 15.1 to 15.2 openSUSE Leap 15.1 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 openSUSE Leap 15.5 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5 In SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and later, SUSE supports service pack skipping if SUSE Customer Center provides it. For example, you can upgrade from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 to SP2, without installing SP1. For supported SUSE Linux Enterprise Server upgrade paths, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html#sec-upgrade-paths-supported. During migration, Uyuni automatically accepts any required licenses (EULAs) before installation. Before starting the product migration: Ensure there are no pending updates or patches. Check the System Status on the client system’s Details Overview page, and install all offered updates or patches. If your client system is not up to date, product migration may fail. Make sure all the channels of the target product are fully synchronized. To check the synchronization status in the Web UI, navigate to the Admin Setup Wizard Products page. Ensure you have a working system backup available, in case of an emergency. Product migration does not have a rollback feature. When the migration procedure has begun, rolling back is not possible. Procedure: Performing a Single System Migration From the Systems Overview page, select a client. From the system details page of the client, navigate to the Software Product Migration tab. Select the target migration path and click Select Channels. From the Product Migration - Channels page select the correct base channel, including Mandatory Child Channels and any additional Optional Child Channels. OPTIONAL: Check Allow Vendor Change to allow packages that have changed vendors to be installed. If this occurs, a notification is shown with details before the migration is started. To migrate openSUSE Leap to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, you must check the Allow Vendor Change option. Click Schedule Migration when your channels have been configured properly. If you want to migrate a large number of clients to the next SP version, you can use Uyuni API calls. The spacecmd commandline tool provides a system_scheduleproductmigration sub command, which can be used to schedule a migration for a large number of clients to the next minor version. The product mass migration operation is dangerous and the process should be tested thoroughly. At least, do a dry-run first. Be careful not to upgrade systems unintentionally. Procedure: Performing a Product Mass Migration List available migration targets, and take note of the system IDs you want to migrate: spacecmd api -- system.listMigrationTargets -A 1000010001 For each system ID, call listMigrationTarget and check that the desired target product is available. If the system ID has an available target, call system.scheduleProductMigration. If the desired target is not available, skip the system. Adapt this template for your environment: target = '[....]' basechannel = 'channel-label' system_ids = [1, 2, 3] session = auth.login(user, pass) for system in system_ids if system.listMigrationTargets(session, system).ident == target system.scheduleProductMigration(session, system, target, basechannel, [], False, ) else print \"Cannot migrate to requested target -- skipping system\" endif endfor For this example, a group will be created temporarily to facilitate the mass migration. Procedure: Creating a Mass Product Migration Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click Create Group. Name the group mpm-target-sles15sp3. Only systems subscribed to the same base channel should be added to the created group. In the example, only systems subscribed to SLE-Product-SLES15-SP2-Pool for x86_64 should be added to the group. For more information about adding clients to groups, see client-configuration:system-groups.adoc#_add_clients_to_groups. Procedure: Adding Systems to the Group Get the targets for all the systems in the group by running: spacecmd -- system_listmigrationtargets group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 The command output a string of \"IDs.\" Only select a target, which is reported for all systems. The string is the identifier for the MIGRATIONTARGET of the other command. The spacecmd sub-commands system_scheduleproductmigration and system_listmigrationtargets are looping over all systems that are part of the group. If there are 100 systems in the group, you will see 100 actions scheduled. All systems in the group must support the same migration target. Procedure: Running the Mass Migration Command The syntax for the system_scheduleproductmigration command is as follows: spacecmd -- system_scheduleproductmigration \\ [options] For this example to upgrade all systems in the group mpm-target-sles15sp3 from SLES 12 SP2 to SLES 15 SP, enter on the command line: spacecmd -- system_scheduleproductmigration group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 \\ sle-product-sles15-sp3-pool-x86_64 \"[190,203,195,1242]\" -d To see syntax usage and options for system_scheduleproductmigration, run: spacecmd system_scheduleproductmigration help For this example we will use the group we created to select all of the systems from that group: group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 This is the label for the target base channel. In this case, the system is being upgraded to SLES 15 SP3, and the label is sle-product-sles15-sp3-pool-x86_64. To see a list of all base channels currently mirrored, run: spacecmd softwarechannel_listbasechannels. Keep in mind you cannot upgrade to a channel unless it is an available target for your current base channel. To identify this value for systems in the group group:mpm-target-sles15sp3, run: spacecmd -- system_listmigrationtargets group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 The MIGRATION_TARGET parameter must be passed in the following format; note necessary shell quotation to prevent sideeffects with brackets: \"[190,203,195,1242]\" Options -s START_TIME -d pass this flag, if you want to do a dry run (it is recommended to run a dry run before the actual migration) -c CHILD_CHANNELS (comma-separated child channels labels with no spaces) In this case we included the -d option, which can be removed after a successful dry run. If successful, the command output for each scheduled system will look like this: Scheduling Product migration for system mpm-sles152-1 Scheduled action ID: 66 You can also track the action, in this case the dry run, in the Web UI for a given system in the group. From the system details page of the client, navigate to Events History. If there are any failures during the dry run, the system should be investigated. If all is well, the -d option can be removed from the command to run the real migration. After the migration is complete, you can reboot the system from the Uyuni Web UI.","title":"Product Migration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"client-upgrades-product-migration","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/client-upgrades-product-migration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Before you can register AlmaLinux clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. The architectures currently supported are: x86_64 and aarch64, on version 9 additionally ppc64le and s390x. For full list of supported products and architectures, see Supported Clients and Features.

The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. For AlmaLinux 9 and AlmaLinux 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels. You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the AlmaLinux 8 client. If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the spacecmd package will fail. You might notice some disparity in the number of packages available in the AppStream channel between upstream and the Uyuni channel. You might also see different numbers if you compare the same channel added at a different point in time. This is due to the way that AlmaLinux manages their repositories. AlmaLinux removes older version of packages when a new version is released, while Uyuni keeps all of them, regardless of age. The AppStream repository provides modular packages. This results in the Uyuni Web UI showing incorrect package information. You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the Web UI or API. Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages, or use the dnf command on the client. For more information about CLM, see Content Lifecycle Management. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository.

You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your AlmaLinux channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the adminstrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.

If you are creating Amazon Linux 2 instances, make sure you regenerate the machine-id after the instances are created. For more information, see Troubleshooting Registering Cloned Clients. Amazon Linux 2023 is not affected by this. Before you register Amazon Linux clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. The architectures currently supported are: x86_64 and aarch64. For full list of supported products and architectures, see Supported Clients and Features. In the following section, descriptions often default to the x86_64 architecture. Replace it with other architectures if appropriate. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 1.

Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your Amazon Linux channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Amazon Linux Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-amazon","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-amazon.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You are responsible for arranging access to CentOS base media repositories and CentOS installation media, as well as connecting Uyuni Server to the CentOS content delivery network. Registering CentOS clients to Uyuni is tested with the default SELinux configuration of enforcing with a targeted policy. You do not need to disable SELinux to register CentOS clients to Uyuni. Before you can register CentOS clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. The architectures currently supported are: x86_64 and aarch64. For full list of supported products and architectures, see Supported Clients and Features. In the following section, descriptions often default to the x86_64 architecture. Replace it with other architectures if appropriate. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 1. CentOS Channels - CLI OS Version Base Channel Client Channel Updates/Appstream Channel CentOS 7 centos7 centos7-uyuni-client centos7-updates Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the spacewalk-common-channels command to add the appropriate channels.

If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels: spacewalk-repo-sync -p - Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing. The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client. If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the spacecmd package will fail. You might notice some disparity in the number of packages available in the AppStream channel between upstream and the Uyuni channel. You might also see different numbers if you compare the same channel added at a different point in time. This is due to the way that CentOS manages their repositories. CentOS removes older version of packages when a new version is released, while Uyuni keeps all of them, regardless of age. The AppStream repository provides modular packages. This results in the Uyuni Web UI showing incorrect package information. You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the Web UI or API. Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages, or use the dnf command on the client. For more information about CLM, see Content Lifecycle Management. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your CentOS channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration. When you update CentOS clients, the packages do not include metadata about the updates. You can use a third-party errata service to obtain this information. The authors of CEFS provide patches or errata on a best-effort basis, in the hope they are useful but with no guarantees of correctness or currency. This could mean that the patch dates could be incorrect, and in at least one case, the published data was shown to be more than a month old. For more information on these cases, see https://github.com/stevemeier/cefs/issues/28#issuecomment-656579382 and https://github.com/stevemeier/cefs/issues/28#issuecomment-656573607. Any problems or delays with the patch data might result in unreliable patch information being imported to your Uyuni Server. This would cause reports, audits, CVE updates, or other patch-related information to also be incorrect. Please consider alternatives to using this service, such as independently verifying patch data, or choosing a different operating system, depending on your security-related requirements and certifications criteria. Procedure: Installing an Errata Service On the Uyuni Server, from the command prompt, as root, add the sle-module-development-tools module: SUSEConnect --product sle-module-development-tools/15.2/x86_64 Install errata service dependencies: zypper in perl-Text-Unidecode Add or edit this line in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: java.allow_adding_patches_via_api = centos7-x86_64-updates,centos7-x86_64,centos7-x86_64-extras Restart Tomcat: systemctl restart tomcat Create a file for your errata script: touch /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh Edit the new file to include this script, editing the repository details as required.

Register Clients This section contains information about registering clients running Debian operating systems. Bootstrapping can be used with Debian clients for performing initial state runs, and for profile updates. Some preparation is required before you can register Debian clients to the Uyuni Server: Ensure DNS is correctly configured and provides an entry for the client. Alternatively, you can configure the /etc/hosts files on both the Uyuni Server and the client with the appropriate entries. The client must have the date and time synchronized with the Uyuni Server before registration.

You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Debian channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. Debian clients can require multiple GPG keys to be installed. When synchronizing third-party Debian repositories, you will need to import the appropriate GPG key on the server. If the GPG key is missing, synchronization will fail. For Debian repositories, only the metadata is signed. Therefore importing a GPG key for the software channel is not needed. Packages will not be re-signed by Uyuni. To see which GPG keys are already imported to Uyuni Server, run the following command: sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys To import a new GPG key, use the --import parameter: sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --import .gpg The root user on Debian is disabled by default for SSH access. To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the sudoers file. Procedure: Granting Root User Access On the client, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Debian Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-debian","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-debian.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your openEuler channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Operating systems either trust their own GPG keys directly or at least ship them installed with the minimal system. But third party packages signed by a different GPG key need manual handling. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Because Debian based systems sign only metadata, there is no need to specify extra keys for single channels. If a user configures an own GPG key to sign the metadata as described in \"Use Your Own GPG Key\" in Signing Repository Metadata the deployment and trust of that key is executed automatically. Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. By providing some pillar data and providing the GPG key files in the Salt filesystem, they are automatically deployed to the client. These keys are deployed into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ on RPM based operating systems and to /usr/share/keyrings/ on Debian systems: Define the pillar key [literalcustom_gpgkeys for the client you want to deploy the key to and list the names of the key file. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg Additionally in the Salt filesystem create a directory named gpg and store there the GPG key files with the name specified in the custom_gpgkeys pillar data. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg. The last step is to add the URL to the GPG key URL field of the software channel. Navigate to Software Manage Channels and select the channel you want to modify. Add to GPG key URL the value file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key. Procedure: Trusting GPG Keys on Clients Using a Bootstrap Script On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the channel assigned to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. A software channel cannot be assigned to a client when the GPG key is not trusted. openEuler clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.

The openSUSE Leap Micro is an ultra-reliable, lightweight operating system purpose built for edge computing. It leverages the enterprise hardened security and compliance components of SUSE Linux Enterprise and merges them with a modern, immutable, developer-friendly OS platform. The openSUSE Leap Micro uses transactional updates. Transactional updates are atomic (all updates are applied only if all updates succeed) and support rollbacks. They do not affect the running system because no changes are activated until the system is rebooted. This information is displayed in the Systems Details Overview subtab.

The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. For Oracle Linux 9 and Oracle Linux 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels. You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client. If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the spacecmd package will fail. The AppStream repository provides modular packages. This results in the Uyuni Web UI showing incorrect package information. You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the Web UI or API. Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages, or use the dnf command on the client. For more information about CLM, see Content Lifecycle Management. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your Oracle Linux channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. For Oracle Linux 9 and Oracle Linux 8 clients use ol8-gpg-pubkey-82562EA9AD986DA3.key For Oracle Linux 7 clients use ol67-gpg-pubkey-72F97B74EC551F0A3.key To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Oracle Linux Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-oracle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-oracle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Activation keys When you have your Uyuni Server set up, you are ready to start registering clients. Ensure you have already added the corresponding products for your clients and synced the repositories to Uyuni. This is required to create the bootstrap repositories used for registering clients. For more information, see installation-and-upgrade:pubcloud-setup.adoc#add-product-sync-repo. An instance started from an on-demand image provided by SUSE is automatically registered, and the update infrastructure and SUSE Linux Enterprise modules are activated. To use your on-demand image as a Uyuni client, you need to disable this automation before you begin. Procedure: Preparing on-demand images Log in to the on-demand instance. At the command prompt, as root, remove the registration data and repositories: registercloudguest --clean Remove the cloud-regionsrv-client package: zypper rm cloud-regionsrv-client Remove additional packages specific to your cloud provider: Amazon EC2: zypper rm regionServiceClientConfigEC2 regionServiceCertsEC2 Google Compute Engine: zypper rm cloud-regionsrv-client-plugin-gce regionServiceClientConfigGCE regionServiceCertsGCE Microsoft Azure: zypper rm regionServiceClientConfigAzure regionServiceCertsAzure For instructions on registering Uyuni to SUSE Customer Center, see SUSE Manager Server Setup. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping, then fill in the Host, SSH Port, User, and Password fields. Make sure you use stable FQDNs for the Host field, or Uyuni cannot find your host when your Public Cloud gives you a different short-lived FQDNS. Public cloud images usually do not allow SSH login with username and password, but only SSH with a certificate. If you want to use bootstrap from the Web UI, you need to enable SSH login with username and SSH key. You can do this by navigating to Systems Bootstrapping and changing the authentication method. If your cloud provider is Microsoft Azure, you can log in with username and password. To do this, you need to allow the AzureUser to run commands as root without a password. To do this, open the /etc/sudoers.d/waagent file, and add or edit this line: AzureUser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL Allowing the AzureUser to run commands as root without a password carries a security risk. Use this method for testing only. Do not do this for production systems. When the bootstrap process has completed successfully, your client is listed at Systems System List. If you want more control over the process or have to register many clients, create a bootstrap script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. For Salt clients and even more control over the process, executing single commands on the command line can be useful. For more information, see Register on the Command Line. When registering clients launched from a public cloud image (for example, AWS AMI), you need to do some additional configuration to prevent them from over-writing each other. For more information about registering clones, see Troubleshooting Registering Cloned Clients. Activation keys are used to ensure that your clients have the correct software entitlements, are connecting to the appropriate channels, and are subscribed to the relevant groups. Each activation key is bound to an organization, which you can set when you create the key. For more on activation keys, see Activation Keys.","title":"Registering clients on a public cloud","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-pubcloud","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-pubcloud.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Register Clients This section contains information about registering clients running Raspberry Pi OS operating systems. Bootstrapping can be used with Raspberry Pi OS clients for performing initial state runs, and for profile updates. Some preparation is required before you can register Raspberry Pi OS clients to the Uyuni Server: Ensure DNS is correctly configured and provides an entry for the client. Alternatively, you can configure the /etc/hosts files on both the Uyuni Server and the client with the appropriate entries. The client must have the date and time synchronized with the Uyuni Server before registration. Before you register Raspberry Pi OS clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. The architectures currently supported are: arm64 and armhf. For full list of supported products and architectures, see Supported Clients and Features. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 1.

If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels: spacewalk-repo-sync -p Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing. The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. You need all the new channels fully synchronized before bootstrapping any Raspberry Pi OS client. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Raspberry Pi OS channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your Raspberry Pi OS channels. For more information on activation keys, see Activation Keys. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. Raspberry Pi OS clients can require multiple GPG keys to be installed. When synchronizing third-party Raspberry Pi OS repositories, you will need to import the appropriate GPG key on the server. If the GPG key is missing, synchronization will fail. For Raspberry Pi OS repositories, only the metadata is signed. Therefore importing a GPG key for the software channel is not needed. Packages will not be re-signed by Uyuni. To see which GPG keys are already imported to Uyuni Server, run the following command: sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys To import a new GPG key, use the --import parameter: sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --import .gpg The root user on Raspberry Pi OS is disabled by default for SSH access. To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the sudoers file. Procedure: Granting Root User Access On the client, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Raspberry Pi OS Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-raspberrypios","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-raspberrypios.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Register Clients This section contains information about using the Red Hat content delivery network (CDN) to register clients running Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems. For information about using Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) instead, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients with RHUI. You are responsible for arranging access to Red Hat base media repositories and RHEL installation media, as well as connecting Uyuni Server to the Red Hat content delivery network. You must obtain support from Red Hat for all your RHEL systems. If you do not do this, you might be violating your terms with Red Hat. Red Hat clients require a Red Hat certificate authority (CA) and entitlement certificate, and an entitlement key. Entitlement certificates are embedded with expiration dates, which match the length of the support subscription. To avoid disruption, you need to repeat this process at the end of every support subscription period. Red Hat supplies a subscription manager tool to manage subscription assignments. It runs locally to track installed products and subscriptions. Clients must be registered with the subscription manager to obtain certificates. Red Hat clients use a URL to replicate repositories. The URL changes depending on where the Red Hat client is registered. Red Hat clients can be registered in three different ways: Red Hat content delivery network (CDN) at redhat.com Red Hat Satellite Server Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) in the cloud This guide covers clients registered to Red Hat CDN. You must have at least one system registered to the CDN, with an authorized subscription for repository content. For information about using Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) instead, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients with RHUI. Satellite certificates for client systems require a Satellite server and subscription. Clients using Satellite certificates are not supported with Uyuni Server. Entitlement certificates are embedded with expiration dates, which match the length of the support subscription. To avoid disruption, you need to repeat this process at the end of every support subscription period. Red Hat supplies the subscription-manager tool to manage subscription assignments. It runs locally on the client system to track installed products and subscriptions. Register to redhat.com with subscription-manager, then follow this procedure to obtain certificates. Procedure: Registering Clients to Subscription Manager On the client system, at the command prompt, register with the subscription manager tool: subscription-manager register Enter your Red Hat Portal username and password when prompted. Run command: subscription-manager activate Copy your entitlement certificate and key from the client system, to a location that the Uyuni Server can access: cp /etc/pki/entitlement/ //entitlement/ Your entitlement certificate and key both have a file extension of .pem. The key also has key in the filename. Copy the Red Hat CA Certificate file from the client system, to the same web location as the entitlement certificate and key: cp /etc/rhsm/ca/redhat-uep.pem //entitlement To manage repositories on your Red Hat client, you need to import the CA and entitlement certificates to the Uyuni Server. This requires that you perform the import procedure three times, to create three entries: one each for the entitlement certificate, the entitlement key, and the Red Hat certificate. Procedure: Importing Certificates to the Server On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation GPG and SSL Keys. Click Create Stored Key/Cert and set these parameters for the entitlement certificate: In the Description field, type Entitlement-Cert-date. In the Type field, select SSL. In the Select file to upload field, browse to the location where you saved the entitlement certificate, and select the .pem certificate file. Click Create Key. Click Create Stored Key/Cert and set these parameters for the entitlement key: In the Description field, type Entitlement-key-date. In the Type field, select SSL. In the Select file to upload field, browse to the location where you saved the entitlement key, and select the .pem key file. Click Create Key. Click Create Stored Key/Cert and set these parameters for the Red Hat certificate: In the Description field, type redhat-uep. In the Type field, select SSL. In the Select file to upload field, browse to the location where you saved the Red Hat certificate, and select the certificate file. Click Create Key. Before you register Red Hat clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. In the following section, descriptions often default to the x86_64 architecture. Replace it with other architectures if appropriate. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 1. Red Hat Channels - CLI OS Version Base Channel Client Channel Tools Channel Red Hat 9 rhel9-pool-uyuni - rhel9-uyuni-client Red Hat 8 rhel8-pool-uyuni - rhel8-uyuni-client Red Hat 7 rhel7-pool-uyuni - rhel7-uyuni-client Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the spacewalk-common-channels command to add the appropriate channels. Ensure you specify the correct architecture: spacewalk-common-channels \\ -a \\ \\ \\ \\ ... If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels: spacewalk-repo-sync -p - Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing. The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. The AppStream repository provides modular packages. This results in the Uyuni Web UI showing incorrect package information. You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the Web UI or API. Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages, or use the dnf command on the client. For more information about CLM, see Content Lifecycle Management. To mirror the software from the Red Hat CDN, you need to create custom channels and repositories in Uyuni that are linked to the CDN by a URL. You must have entitlements to these products in your Red Hat Portal for this to work correctly. You can use the subscription manager tool to get the URLs of the repositories you want to mirror: subscription-manager repos You can use these repository URLs to create custom repositories. This allows you to mirror only the content you need to manage your clients. You can only create custom versions of Red Hat repositories if you have the correct entitlements in your Red Hat Portal. The details you need for this procedure are: Table 2. Red Hat Custom Repository Settings Option Setting Repository URL The content URL provided by Red Hat CDN Has Signed Metadata? Uncheck all Red Hat Enterprise repositories SSL CA Certificate redhat-uep SSL Client Certificate Entitlement-Cert-date SSL Client Key Entitlement-Key-date Procedure: Creating Custom Repositories On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Repositories. Click Create Repository and set the appropriate parameters for the repository. Click Create Repository. Repeat for all repositories you need to create. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 3. Red Hat Custom Channels OS Version Base Channel Red Hat 9 rhel9-pool-uyuni Red Hat 8 rhel8-pool-uyuni Red Hat 7 rhel7-pool-uyuni Procedure: Creating Custom Channels On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels. Click Create Channel and set the appropriate parameters for the channels. In the Parent Channel field, select the appropriate base channel. Click Create Channel. Repeat for all channels you need to create. There should be one custom channel for each custom repository. You can check that you have created all the appropriate channels and repositories, by navigating to Software Channel List All. For Red Hat 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels. You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. If you are using modular channels, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client. If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the spacecmd package will fail. When you have created all the channels, you can associate them with the repositories you created: Procedure: Associating Channels with Repositories On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and click the channel to associate. Navigate to the Repositories tab, and check the repository to associate with this channel. Click Update Repositories to associate the channel and the repository. Repeat for all channels and repositories you need to associate. OPTIONAL: Navigate to the Sync tab to set a recurring schedule for synchronization of this repository. Click Sync Now to begin synchronization immediately. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. Procedure: OPTIONAL: Creating a Salt State to Deploy Configuration Files On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type subscription-manager: disable yum plugins. In the Label field, type subscription-manager-disable-yum-plugins. In the Description field, type subscription-manager: disable yum plugins. In the SLS Contents field, leave it empty. Click Create Config Channel Click Create Configuration File In the Filename/Path field type /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf. In the File Contents field type: [main] enabled=0 Click Create Configuration File Take note of the value of the field Salt Filesystem Path`. Click on the name of the Configuration Channel. Click on View/Edit 'init.sls' File In the File Contents field, type: configure_subscription-manager-disable-yum-plugins: cmd.run: - name: subscription-manager config --rhsm.auto_enable_yum_plugins=0 - watch: - file: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf file.managed: - name: /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf - source: salt:///etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf Click Update Configuration File. The Creating a Salt State to Deploy Configuration Files procedure is optional. Procedure: Creating a System Group for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Clients On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups. Click Create Group. In the Name field, type rhel-systems. In the Description field, type All RHEL systems. Click Create Group. Click States tab. Click Configuration Channels tab. Type subscription-manager: disable yum plugins at the search box. Click Search to see the state. Click the checkbox for the state at the Assign column. Click Save changes. Click Confirm. If you already have RHEL systems added to Uyuni, assign them to the new system group, and then apply the highstate. Procedure: Adding the System Group to Activation Keys You need to modify the activation keys you used for RHEL systems to include the system group created above. On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys. For each the Activation Keys you used for RHEL systems, click on it and: Navigate to the Groups tab, and the Join subtab. Check Select rhel-systems. Click Join Selected Groups. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. For the Red Hat custom channels, if you want to check the Enable GPG Check field, you need to populate the GPG Key URL field. You can use the file URL of the GPG key stored in the directory /etc/pki/rpm-gpg of the Red Hat minion. Example: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release For the complete list of the Red Hat product signing keys, see https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux Clients with CDN","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-rh-cdn","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-rh-cdn.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Register clients This section contains information about using Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) to register clients running Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems. If you are running clients in a public cloud, such as Amazon EC2, use this method. It is possible to use RHUI in conjunction with the Red Hat content delivery network (CDN) to manage your Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions. For information about using Red Hat CDN, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux Clients with CDN. You are responsible for connecting Uyuni Server to the Red Hat update infrastructure. All clients that get updates using this RHUI certificate need to be correctly licensed, please check with your cloud provider and the Red Hat terms of service for more information. When Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients registered with RHUI are switched off, Red Hat might declare the certificate invalid. In this case, you need to turn the client on again, or get a new RHUI certificate. In the past it was required to import the certificates and entitlement data manual into Uyuni Server. This task has been automated by using the same mechanism as for SUSE PAYG instances. Fir more information, see Connect PAYG instance. This guide covers clients registered to Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI). You must have at least one system registered to RHUI, with an authorized subscription for repository content. For information about using Red Hat content delivery network (CDN) instead, see Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux Clients with CDN. Satellite certificates for client systems require a Satellite server and subscription. Clients using Satellite certificates are not supported with Uyuni Server. The PAYG connection regular checks with the client to get the latest authentication data. It is important that the client stays running and is regular updated. If this does not happen, repository synchronization will fail with authentication errors at some point in time. Update any Red Hat 7 instance before connecting it. A Red Hat 9 instance needs to be configured with the crypto policy LEGACY to be able to connect it. Execute sudo update-crypto-policies --set LEGACY to configure it accordingly. Procedure: Connecting new Red Hat instance In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard PAYG, and click Add PAYG. Start with the page section PAYG connection Description. In the Description field, add the description. Move to the page section Instance SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the instance DNS or IP address to connect from Uyuni. In the SSH Port field, enter the port number or use default value 22. In the User field, enter the username as specified in the cloud. In the Password field, enter the password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the instance key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the key passphrase. Authentication keys must always be in PEM format. If you are not connecting directly to the instance, but via SSH bastion, proceed with Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data. Otherwise, continue with Procedure: Finishing Red Hat connecting. Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data Navigate to the page section Bastion SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the bastion hostname. In the SSH Port field, enter the bastion port number. In the User field, enter the bastion username. In the Password field, enter the bastion password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the bastion key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the bastion key passphrase. Complete the setup with Procedure: Finishing Red Hat connecting. Procedure: Finishing Red Hat connecting To complete adding new Red Hat connection data, click Create. Return to PAYG connection data Details page. The updated connection status is displayed on the top section named Information. Connection status is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go screen, too. If the authentication data for the instance is correct, the column Status shows Credentials successfully updated. If invalid data is entered at any point, the newly created instance is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > PAYG, with column Status displaying an error message. As soon as the authentication data is available on the server, repositories were added for all available repositories on the connected instance. The repositories can be seen in Software > Manage > Repositories A Red Hat connection will create custom repositories which are owned by organization 1 by default. If a different organization should own the autogenerated repositories, configure java.rhui_default_org_id in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. This only defines and updates the repositories. If you want to use a repository for a managed client, you need to specify a Software Channel and connect the repositories to it. Before you register Red Hat clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. In the following section, descriptions often default to the x86_64 architecture. Replace it with other architectures if appropriate. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 1.

Ensure you specify the correct architecture: spacewalk-common-channels \\ -a \\ \\ \\ \\ ... If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels: spacewalk-repo-sync -p - Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing. The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. The AppStream repository provides modular packages. This results in the Uyuni Web UI showing incorrect package information. You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the Web UI or API. Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages, or use the dnf command on the client. For more information about CLM, see Content Lifecycle Management. To mirror the software from RHUI, you need to create custom channels in Uyuni that are linked to autogenerated repositories. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 2. Red Hat Custom Channels OS Version Base Channel Red Hat 7 rhel7-pool-uyuni Red Hat 8 rhel8-pool-uyuni Red Hat 9 rhel9-pool-uyuni Procedure: Creating Custom Channels On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels.

Repeat for all channels you need to create. There should be one custom channel for each custom repository. You can check that you have created all the appropriate channels and repositories, by navigating to Software Channel List All. For Red Hat 8 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels. You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. When you have created all the channels, you can associate them with the repositories you created: Procedure: Associating Channels with Repositories On the Uyuni Server Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, and click the channel to associate. Navigate to the Repositories tab, and check the repository to associate with this channel. Click Update Repositories to associate the channel and the repository. Repeat for all channels and repositories you need to associate. OPTIONAL: Navigate to the Sync tab to set a recurring schedule for synchronization of this repository. Click Sync Now to begin synchronization immediately. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients with RHUI","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-rh-rhui","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-rh-rhui.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Manage Errata This section contains information about registering clients running Rocky Linux operating systems. Registering Rocky Linux clients to Uyuni is tested with the default SELinux configuration of enforcing with a targeted policy. You do not need to disable SELinux to register Rocky Linux clients to Uyuni. Before you can register Rocky Linux clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them. The architectures currently supported are: x86_64 and aarch64, on version 9 additionally ppc64le and s390x. For full list of supported products and architectures, see Supported Clients and Features. In the following section, descriptions often default to the x86_64 architecture. Replace it with other architectures if appropriate. The channels you need for this procedure are: Table 1. Rocky Linux Channels - CLI OS Version Base Channel Client Channel AppStream Channel Rocky Linux 9 rockylinux9 rockylinux9-uyuni-client rockylinux9-appstream Rocky Linux 8 rockylinux8 rockylinux8-uyuni-client rockylinux8-appstream Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the spacewalk-common-channels command to add the appropriate channels. Ensure you specify the correct architecture: spacewalk-common-channels \\ -a \\ \\ \\ \\ ... If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels: spacewalk-repo-sync -p - Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing. The client tools channel provided by spacewalk-common-channels is sourced from Uyuni and not from SUSE. For Rocky Linux 8 and Rocky Linux 9 clients, add both the Base and AppStream channels. You require packages from both channels. If you do not add both channels, you cannot create the bootstrap repository, due to missing packages. You might notice some disparity in the number of packages available in the AppStream channel between upstream and the Uyuni channel. You might also see different numbers if you compare the same channel added at a different point in time. This is due to the way that Rocky Linux manages their repositories. Rocky Linux removes older version of packages when a new version is released, while Uyuni keeps all of them, regardless of age. If you are using modular channels with Rocky Linux 8, you must enable the Python 3.6 module stream on the client. If you do not provide Python 3.6, the installation of the spacecmd package will fail. The AppStream repository provides modular packages. This results in the Uyuni Web UI showing incorrect package information. You cannot perform package operations such as installing or upgrading directly from modular repositories using the Web UI or API. Alternatively, you can use Salt states to manage modular packages, or use the dnf command on the client. For more information about CLM, see Content Lifecycle Management. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your Rocky Linux channels.

Following the bootstrapping process, automatic booting is disabled on SLE Micro clients. This change was implemented due to intermittent automatic reboots, which could occurr before Salt could relay the results of applying the bootstrap salt state. Although a reboot is automatically scheduled after registration is completed, it is respecting the default reboot manager maintenance window. This window may be several hours after the client is registered. It is advisable to manually reboot the client after the registration script finishes, to speed up the registration and to see the system appear in the system list. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration. When using a bootstrap script with SLE Micro systems, ensure that the certificate section of the script has this content: ORG_CA_CERT=RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT ORG_CA_CERT_IS_RPM_YN=0 Either edit the bootstrap script directly and add the settings, or create the bootstrap script with these parameters: mgr-bootstrap --script=bootstrap-sle-micro.sh \\ --ssl-cert=/srv/www/htdocs/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT SLE Micro is a transactional system. Transactional updates in general support several reboot methods. It is recommended to use systemd for rebooting in systems managed by Uyuni. Using other methods can lead to undesired behavior. When bootstrapping a transactional system on Uyuni, systemd will be configured as the reboot method (REBOOT_METHOD), if the system is in its default configuration. Such a configuration allows Uyuni to control the reboot action, and rebooting can be performed immediately or scheduled with Uyuni as wanted. By default, the reboot method during client installation is set to auto. With the auto boot method, rebootmgrd will be used to reboot the system according to the configured policies if the service is running. Policies can be to reboot instantly or during a maintenance window. For more information, see the rebootmgrd(8) man page. Otherwise if rebootmgrd is not running, Uyuni will call systemctl reboot. Using any method different from systemd may cause undesired behavior.","title":"Registering SLE Micro Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-slemicro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-slemicro.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

SUSE Liberty Linux clients are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS. SUSE Liberty Linux clients are sometimes also called SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Expanded Support (SLESES), Liberty, RES or Red Hat Expanded Support. The SUSE Liberty Linux software channels provided by SUSE only provide updates to packages, they do not provide the packages themselves. To register SUSE Liberty Linux clients, you need to register the SUSE Liberty Linux Product (outlined below) to create the necessary base channel, then import any required Red Hat or CentOS packages as custom child channels. You must obtain the initial packages directly from Red Hat or CentOS before you can apply the updates provided by the SUSE Liberty Linux software channels. You are responsible for arranging access to Red Hat or CentOS base media repositories and installation media. SUSE does not provide support for SUSE Liberty Linux systems on Uyuni. For SUSE Liberty Linux clients, some required packages are contained on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS installation media. You must have these packages installed before you can register a SUSE Liberty Linux client. The SUSE Liberty Linux product is provided by SUSE Customer Center. This also includes the client tools package. Before you register SUSE Liberty Linux clients to your Uyuni Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Ubuntu channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. The root user on Ubuntu is disabled by default for SSH access. To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the sudoers file. This issue happens with self-installed versions of Ubuntu. If the default user has been granted administrative privileges during installation time, a password is requiered to perform privilege escalation using sudo. With cloud instances this does not happen because cloud-init automatically creates a file under /etc/sudoers.d and grants privilege escalation through sudo without the need for a password. i Procedure: Granting root user access On the client, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Ubuntu 18.04 clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-ubuntu-old","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-ubuntu-old.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Ubuntu Channels - CLI OS Version Base Channel Main Channel Updates Channel Security Channel Client Channel Ubuntu 22.04 ubuntu-2204-pool-amd64-uyuni ubuntu-2204-amd64-main-uyuni ubuntu-2204-amd64-main-updates-uyuni ubuntu-2204-amd64-main-security-uyuni ubuntu-2204-amd64-uyuni-client Ubuntu 20.04 ubuntu-2004-pool-amd64-uyuni ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-uyuni ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-updates-uyuni ubuntu-2004-amd64-main-security-uyuni ubuntu-2004-amd64-uyuni-client Version 20.04 also requires the Universe channels: Table 2. Ubuntu 20.04 Universe Channels - CLI Ubuntu 20.04 Universe Channel ubuntu-2004-amd64-universe-uyuni Universe Updates Channel ubuntu-2004-amd64-universe-updates-uyuni Universe Security Updates Channel ubuntu-2004-amd64-universe-security-uyuni Universe Backports Channel ubuntu-2004-amd64-universe-backports-uyuni Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the spacewalk-common-channels command to add the appropriate channels: spacewalk-common-channels \\ \\ \\ \\ ... If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels: spacewalk-repo-sync -p Ensure the synchronization is complete before continuing. You need all the new channels fully synchronized before bootstrapping any Ubuntu client. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Ubuntu channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. For more information about GPG keys, see GPG Keys. The root user on Ubuntu is disabled by default for SSH access. To be able to onboard using a regular user, you need to edit the sudoers file. This issue happens with self-installed versions of Ubuntu. If the default user has been granted administrative privileges during installation time, a password is requiered to perform privilege escalation using sudo. With cloud instances this does not happen because cloud-init automatically creates a file under /etc/sudoers.d and grants privilege escalation through sudo without the need for a password. Procedure: Granting Root User Access On the client, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required. We recommend that you remove the line from the sudoers file after the client has been successfully installed. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration.","title":"Registering Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-ubuntu","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-ubuntu.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configuration parameters are scripted and stored in configuration files. You can write configuration files directly using the Uyuni Web UI, or you can upload or link to files that exist in other locations. Configuration files can be centrally managed. Centrally managed configuration files are provided by global configuration channels and can be applied to any client subscribed to the Uyuni Server. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. Configuration files are version-controlled, so you can add configuration settings, test them on your clients, and roll back to a previous revision as required. When you have created your configuration channels, you can also perform comparisons between various configuration files, and between revisions of the same configuration file. Centrally managed configuration files are provided by global configuration channels. This table shows the supported features, where: features are supported by SUSE features are not supported by SUSE features are under consideration, and may or may not be supported at a later date.

In the File Type field, choose whether you want to create a text file, directory, or symbolic link. In the Filename/Path field, type the absolute path to the location where the file should be deployed. If you are creating a symbolic link, type the target file and path in the Symbolic Link Target Filename/Path field. Type the User name and Group name for the file in the Ownership field, and the File Permissions Mode. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure SELinux contexts to enable the required file attributes (for example: user, role, and file type). If the configuration file includes a macro, enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro. Enter the configuration file contents in the File Contents text box, using the script drop-down box to choose the appropriate scripting language. Click Create Configuration File. You can subscribe individual clients to configuration channels by navigating to Systems System List, selecting the client you want to subscribe, and navigating to the Configuration tab. To subscribe multiple clients to a configuration channel, you can use the system set manager (SSM). Procedure: Subscribing Multiple Clients to Configuration Channels In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the clients you want to work with. Navigate to Systems System Set Manager, and go to the Configuration Subscribe to Channels subtab to see the list of available configuration channels. OPTIONAL: Click the number in the Systems currently subscribed column to see which clients are currently subscribed to the configuration channel. Check the configuration channels you want to subscribe to, and click Continue. Rank the configuration channels using the up and down arrows. Where settings conflicts occur between configuration channels, channels closer to the top of the list take precedence. Determine how the channels are applied to the selected clients. Click Subscribe With Lowest Priority to add the new channels at a lower priority than currently subscribed channels. Click Subscribe with Highest Priority to add the new channels at a higher priority than currently subscribed channels. Click Replace Existing Subscriptions to remove existing channels and replace them with the new channels. Click Apply Subscriptions. If new configuration channel priorities conflict with existing channels, the duplicate channel is removed and replaced according to the new priority. If the client’s configuration priorities are going to be reordered by an action, the Web UI requires you to confirm the change before proceeding. You can also use the system set manager (SSM) to compare the configuration file deployed on clients with the configuration file stored on the Uyuni Server. Procedure: Comparing Configuration Files In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the clients subscribed to the configuration files you want to compare.

They are based on Salt protocols. Which Salt contact method you use depends on the type of client, and your network architecture: Default (Salt) is the default choice and is recommended unless there are specific needs. For more information, see Default contact method for Salt clients. SSH Push is useful only if network restrictions make it impossible for clients to establish contact to the server. It is supported with the Salt Bundle only. This contact method has serious limitations. For more information, see SSH Push contact method. SSH Push (with tunnel) is the same as SSH Push, but with using a secured communication tunnel. For more information, see SSH Push (with tunnel) contact method. Implementation of Salt communication software options: Salt Bundle is a single binary package containing Salt Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries. Thus the Salt contact method is independent from software installed on the client. Using the Salt Bundle is the default. It is the only supported implementation for the SSH Push or SSH Push (with tunnel) contact method. For more information, see Salt Bundle. Salt Minion is Salt software installed on the client system. The so-called traditional contact protocol is no longer supported with Uyuni 5.0 and later. Before upgrading from Uyuni 4 to 5, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt or replaced with Salt proxies.","title":"Client Contact Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-intro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-intro.html","titles":[]},"93":{"id":93,"text":"Table of Contents 1. Onboarding Details The default contact method using the Salt protocol is recommended unless there are specific needs. For more information about Salt in general, see Salt Guide Overview. Software updates are generally pushed from the server to the client. Connections are initiated from the client. This means you must open ports on the server, not on clients. The Salt clients are also known as Salt minions. Uyuni Server installs a daemon on every client. If you need to use Salt clients in a disconnected setup you can configure SSH Push as a contact method. With this contact method, clients can be located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. For more information about SSH Push, see SSH Push contact method. Salt has its own database to keep the keys for the minions. This needs to be kept in sync with the Uyuni database. As soon as the key is accepted in Salt, the onboarding process in Uyuni starts. The onboarding process will look for existing systems in the Uyuni database by searching for the minion_id and the machine-id. Depending on the outcome, the following scenarios are possible: If nothing is found, the new system gets created. In case an entry with the minion_id or the machine-id is found, that system will be migrated to match the new system. In case there is a match for both entries, and they are not the same system, the onboarding will be aborted with an error. In this case the administrator needs to resolve the conflict by removing at least one of the systems.","title":"Default contact method for Salt clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-salt","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-salt.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Using the Salt Bundle with the Salt Minion 2.2. Switching from Salt Minion to Salt Bundle 3. SSH Push with the Salt Bundle 4. Extend Salt Bundle with Python packages using pip The Salt Bundle is a single binary package containing Salt Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries. The Salt Bundle is shipped with Python 3 and all the requirements for Salt to run. Thus Salt Bundle does not use the Python version install on the client as system software. The Salt Bundle can be installed on clients that do not meet the requirements for a given Salt version. It is also possible to use the Salt Bundle on systems that run a Salt Minion connected to a Salt Master other than the Uyuni Salt Master. The registration method with the Salt Bundle is the recommended registration method. This section explains the advantages and limitations of the current implementation. The Salt Bundle is provided as the venv-salt-minion that consists of Salt, Python 3, and the Python modules Salt depends on. Bootstrapping with Web UI is using Salt Bundle as well, so bootstrapping with Web UI is not Python dependant. Using the Salt Bundle, it is no longer needed that the client provides any Python interpreter or modules. If you bootstrap new clients, registration with the Salt Bundle is the default method. You can switch existing clients to the Salt Bundle method. If you switch, the salt-minion package and its dependencies will stay installed. The Salt Bundle can be used with the Salt Minion managed by the Salt Master other than Uyuni Server at the same time. If the Salt Bundle is installed on a client Uyuni Server will manage the configuration files of the Salt Bundle, the configuration files of salt-minion will not be managed in this case. For more information, see Salt Bundle configuration. To bootstrap a client with the Salt Minion managed by the Salt Master other than Uyuni Server it is recommended to use mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle when generating the bootstrap script, or to set FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION to 1 in the bootstrap script. For bootstrapping with Web UI mgr_force_venv_salt_minion set to true pillar can be specified globally. For more information, see Salt States and Pillars. The Salt state util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion is available to switch from salt-minion to venv-salt-minion. It is recommended to switch to venv-salt-minion in two steps to avoid trouble with shifting processes: Procedure: Switching with util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion state to venv-salt-minion Apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion with no pillar specified first. This will result in the switch to venv-salt-minion with copying configuration files etc. It will not clean up the original salt-minion configurations and its packages. salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion Apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion with mgr_purge_non_venv_salt set to True to remove salt-minion and with mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files set to True to remove all the files related to salt-minion. This second step ensures the first step was processed, and then removes the old configuration files and the now obsolete salt-minion package. salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' In case of running the second step of switching with skipping the first step, state apply process could fail as it requires stopping the salt-minion which is used to execute the command on the client side. On the other hand, it is also possible to avoid installing the Salt Bundle and keep using salt-minion instead. In this case, specify one of these options: Execute mgr-bootstrap with --no-bundle option. Set AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION to 1 in the generated bootstrap script. For bootstrap state set the mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillar to True. The Salt Bundle is also used when performing SSH Push actions to clients. A shell script deploys the Salt Bundle onto the target system without installing venv-salt-minion before any Salt command is executed. Because the Salt Bundle contains the whole Salt code base, no salt-thin is deployed. SSH Push (including bootstrapping using the Web UI) uses the Python 3 interpreter within the bundle. The target system does not need to have any other Python interpreter installed. The Python 3 deployed with the Bundle is used to handle SSH Push session on the client, so SSH Push (including bootstrapping with Web UI) is not dependant on Python installed on the system. Using salt-thin can be enabled as a fallback method, but it requires Python 3 to be installed on the client. This method is not recommended nor supported and exists for development purposes only. Set web.ssh_use_salt_thin to true in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. The bootstrap repository must be created before bootstrapping the client with Web UI. SSH Push is using the Salt Bundle taken from the bootstrap repository based on the detected target operating system. For more information, see client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository. SSH Push is using /var/tmp to deploy Salt Bundle to and execute Salt commands on the client with the bundled Python. Therefore you must not mount /var/tmp with the noexec option. It is not possible to bootstrap the clients, which have /var/tmp mounted with noexec option, with the Web UI because the bootstrap process is using SSH Push to reach a client. The Salt Bundle includes pip to make it possible to extend the functionality of the bundled Salt Minion with extra Python packages. By default, salt pip.install installs the Python package specified by into /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local. If needed, the path /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local can be overridden by setting the VENV_PIP_TARGET environment variable for the venv-salt-minion.service. It is recommended to use a systemd drop-in configuration file for the service. It could be done with the configuration file /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf: [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip The Python packages installed through pip are not changing on updating the Salt Bundle. To ensure that such packages are available and functional after an update, it is recommended to install them with a Salt state that is applied after Salt Bundle updates.","title":"Salt Bundle","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network, including the Uyuni Server. This SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the Uyuni Server on the internal network to the clients located on the DMZ. After all actions and events are executed, the tunnel is closed. The server uses SSH to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with SSH Push. The tunnel is used to provide the access to the server through the encrypted tunnel. The repositories assigned to the SSH Push client (with tunnel) are provided through this tunnel only, thus it is not possible to use package manager tools directly from the client system because the repositories are available only while the tunnel is up. In other words, access is only possible if the session is initiated by the server. All package managing operations on the client can be performed from the server side only. For tunneling connections via SSH, a port number is required for tunneling via HTTPS. The port number used by default is 1233. To overwrite it, you can add a custom port numbers greater than 1024 to /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: ssh_push_port_https = high_port After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service.

In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network where the Uyuni Server is located. SSH Push is also to use if installing a daemon agent on clients is not possible. The SSH Push method has serious limitations. It does not scale well, and consumes more Server resources and network bandwidth than the plain Salt method (default). The Push SSH method is not at all supported with large setups (1000 clients and more). The server uses the SSH Push to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with SSH Push. This image demonstrates the SSH Push process path. All items left of the Taskomatic block represent processes running on the Uyuni client. To use SSH Push, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the salt-api daemon running on the Uyuni Server. Additionally, the required Python version will be deployed with the Salt Bundle on the client system. Before beginning with the following registering procedure, define an activation key with the SSH Push contact method configured. This method expects that there is a direct connection with HTTPS to the Server. You need to use the Web UI or API to register these clients with the Uyuni Server. See the following procedure or example. Procedure: Registering clients with SSH Push In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping and complete the appropriate fields. Select an activation key with the SSH Push contact method configured. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Check the Manage system completely via SSH checkbox. Click Bootstrap to begin registration. Confirm that the system has been registered correctly by navigating to Systems Overview. Example: API Access to Push via SSH You can use the API to manage which contact method to use. This example Python code sets the contact method to ssh-push. Valid values are: default (pull) ssh-push ssh-push-tunnel client = xmlrpclib.Server(SUMA_HOST + \"/rpc/api\", verbose=0) key = client.auth.login(SUMA_LOGIN, SUMA_PASSWORD) client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'}) When you are configuring SSH Push, you can modify parameters that are used when a system is registered, including the host, activation key, and password. The password is used only for bootstrapping, it is not saved anywhere. All future SSH sessions are authorized via a key/certificate pair. These parameters are configured in Systems Bootstrapping. You can also configure persistent parameters that are used system-wide, including the sudo user to access the system as an unprivileged user instead of as root. Procedure: Configuring unprivileged SSH access Ensure you have the latest spacewalk-taskomatic and spacewalk-certs-tools packages installed on the Uyuni Server. On each client system, create an appropriate unprivileged user. On each client system, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Grant sudo access to the user by adding this line at the end of the sudoers file. Replace with the name of the user that is bootstrapping the client in the Web UI: ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python This procedure grants root access without requiring a password, which is required for registering the client. When the client is successfully installed it runs with root privileges, so the access is no longer required.

To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart spacewalk-service as root: spacewalk-service restart The SSH Push feature uses taskomatic to execute scheduled actions using salt-ssh. The taskomatic job periodically checks for scheduled actions and executes them. The SSH Push feature executes a complete salt-ssh call based on the scheduled action. By default, twenty Salt SSH actions can be executed at a time. You can increase the number of actions that can be executed in parallel, by adding these lines to your configuration file, and adjusting the value of parallel_threads upwards. We recommend you keep the number of parallel actions low, to avoid problems: taskomatic.sshminion_action_executor.parallel_threads = org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = This adjusts the number of actions that can run in parallel on any one client and the total number of worker threads used by taskomatic. If actions needs to be run on multiple clients, actions are always executed sequentially on each client. If the clients are connected through a proxy, you need to adjust the MaxSessions settings on the proxy. In this case, set the number of parallel connections to be three times the total number of clients. There are some features that are not yet supported on SSH Push. These features do not work on Salt SSH clients: OpenSCAP auditing Beacons, resulting in: Installing a package on a system using zypper does not invoke the package refresh. Virtual Host functions (for example, a host to guests) does not work if the virtual host system is Salt SSH-based.

Procedure: Creating a Custom System Information Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Custom System Info, and click Create Key. In the Key Label field, add a name for your key. Do not use spaces. For example, intel-x86_64-quadcore. In the Description field, provide any additional information required. Repeat for each key you require. The information is available via Salt pillar. You can retrieve this information with a command such as: salt $minionid pillar.get custom_info:key1 This command will result in an output such as: $minionid: val1 When you have created some custom system information keys, you can apply them to clients. Procedure: Applying Custom Information Keys to Clients In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems, click the client to apply custom information to, and navigate to the Details Custom Info tab.

Trust GPG Keys on Clients 1.1. User defined GPG keys 1.2. GPG Keys in Bootstrap Scripts Clients use GPG keys to check the authenticity of software packages before they are installed. Only trusted software can be installed on clients. In most cases, you do not need to adjust the GPG settings to be able to install software on your clients. RPM packages can be signed directly, while Debian based systems sign only the metadata and use a chain of checksums to secure the packages. Most RPM based systems use signed metadata in addition to signed packages. Operating systems either trust their own GPG keys directly or at least ship them installed with the minimal system. But third party packages signed by a different GPG key need manual handling. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Because Debian based systems sign only metadata, there is no need to specify extra keys for single channels. If a user configures an own GPG key to sign the metadata as described in \"Use Your Own GPG Key\" in Signing Repository Metadata the deployment and trust of that key is executed automatically. Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. By providing some pillar data and providing the GPG key files in the Salt filesystem, they are automatically deployed to the client. These keys are deployed into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ on RPM based operating systems and to /usr/share/keyrings/ on Debian systems: Define the pillar key [literalcustom_gpgkeys for the client you want to deploy the key to and list the names of the key file. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg Additionally in the Salt filesystem create a directory named gpg and store there the GPG key files with the name specified in the custom_gpgkeys pillar data. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg. The last step is to add the URL to the GPG key URL field of the software channel. Navigate to Software Manage Channels and select the channel you want to modify. Add to GPG key URL the value file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key. Procedure: Trusting GPG Keys on Clients Using a Bootstrap Script On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the channel assigned to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. A software channel cannot be assigned to a client when the GPG key is not trusted.","title":"GPG Keys","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"gpg-keys","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/gpg-keys.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Power Management and Cobbler You can power on, power off, and reboot clients using the Uyuni Web UI. This feature uses either the IPMI or Redfish protocol and is managed using a Cobbler profile. The selected client must have a power management controller supporting one of these protocols. For Redfish, ensure you can establish a valid SSL connection between the client and the Uyuni Server. You must have trusted the certificate authority used to sign the SSL Server Certificate of the Redfish management controller.

Create a Bootstrap Script with mgr-bootstrap 2. Create a Bootstrap Script from Web UI 3. Edit a Bootstrap Script 4. Connect Clients Registering clients with a bootstrap script gives you control over parameters, and can help if you have to register a large number of clients at once. To register clients using a bootstrap script, we recommend you create a template bootstrap script to begin, which can then be copied and modified. The bootstrap script you create is executed on the client when it is registered, and ensures all the necessary packages are deployed to the client. Some parameters in the bootstrap script ensure the client system can be assigned to its base channel, using activation key and GPG key. It is important that you check the repository information carefully, to ensure it matches the base channel repository. If the repository information does not match exactly, the bootstrap script cannot download the correct packages. All clients need a bootstrap repository. It is automatically created and regenerated on the Uyuni Server when products are synchronized. A bootstrap repository includes packages for installing Salt on clients, and for registering clients. For more information about creating a bootstrap repository, see Bootstrap Repository. GPG Keys and Uyuni Client Tools The GPG key used by Uyuni Client Tools is not trusted by default. When you create your bootstrap script, add a path to the file containing the public key fingerprint with the ORG_GPG_KEY parameter. openSUSE Leap 15 and SLE 15 use Python 3 by default. Bootstrap scripts based on Python 2 must be re-created for openSUSE Leap 15 and SLE 15 systems. If you register openSUSE Leap 15 or SLE 15 systems using Python 2, the bootstrap script fails. The mgr-bootstrap command generates custom bootstrap scripts. A bootstrap script is used by Uyuni client systems for simplifying their initial registration and configuration. The arguments --activation-keys and --script, are the only mandatory arguments. On the Uyuni Server, as root at the command line execute it with the mandatory arguments. Replace with your values: mgr-bootstrap --activation-keys= --script=bootstrap-.sh The mgr-bootstrap command offers several other options, including the ability to set a specific hostname, set specific GPG keys, and set the registration method (salt-minion or salt-bundle). For more information, see the mgr-bootstrap man page, or run mgr-bootstrap --help. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create an editable bootstrap script. Procedure: Creating a Bootstrap Script In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Manager Configuration Bootstrap Script. The required fields are pre-populated with values derived from previous installation steps. For details on each setting, see Bootstrap Script. Click Update to create the script. The bootstrap script is generated and stored on the server in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap directory. Alternatively, you can access the bootstrap script over HTTPS. Replace with the host name of your Uyuni Server: https:///pub/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh Do not disable SSL in your bootstrap script. Ensure that Enable SSL is checked in the Web UI, or that the setting USING_SSL=1 exists in the bootstrap script. If you disable SSL, the registration process requires custom SSL certificates. For more information about custom certificates, see SSL Certificates. You can copy and modify the template bootstrap script you created to customize it. A minimal requirement when modifying a bootstrap script for use with Uyuni is the inclusion of an activation key. Most packages are signed with GPG, so you also need to have trusted GPG keys on your system to install them. In this procedure, you need to know the exact name of your activation keys. Navigate to Home Overview and, in the Tasks box, click Manage Activation Keys. All keys created for channels are listed on this page. You must enter the full name of the key you wish to use in the bootstrap script exactly as presented in the key field. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Procedure: Modifying a Bootstrap Script On your Uyuni Server, as root at the command line change to the bootstrap directory with: cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ Create and rename two copies of the template bootstrap script for use with each of your clients. cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles12.sh cp bootstrap.sh bootstrap-sles15.sh Open bootstrap-sles15.sh for modification. Scroll down until you can see the text shown below. If exit 1 exists in the file, comment it out by typing a hash or pound sign (#) at the beginning of the line. This activates the script. Enter the name of the key for this script in the ACTIVATION_KEYS= field: echo \"Enable this script: comment (with #'s) this block (or, at least just\" echo \"the exit below)\" echo #exit 1 # can be edited, but probably correct (unless created during initial install): # NOTE: ACTIVATION_KEYS *must* be used to bootstrap a client machine. ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-sles15 ORG_GPG_KEY= When you have finished, save the file, and repeat this procedure for the second bootstrap script. By default, bootstrap script will try to install venv-salt-minion if it is available in the bootstrap repository and salt-minion if there is no Salt bundle in the bootstrap repository. It is possible to avoid installing Salt bundle and keep using salt-minion if you need it for some reason. For more information, see Salt Bundle. When you have finished creating your script, you can use it to register clients. Procedure: Running the Bootstrap Script On the Uyuni Server, log in as root. At the command prompt, and change to the bootstrap directory: cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ Run this command to execute the bootstrap script on the client; replace EXAMPLE.COM with the host name of your client: cat bootstrap-sles15.sh | ssh root@EXAMPLE.COM /bin/bash Alternatively, on the client, run this command: curl -Sks https://server_hostname/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-sles15.sh | /bin/bash To avoid problems, make sure the bootstrap script is executed using bash. This script downloads the required dependencies located in the repositories directory you created earlier. When the script has finished running, you can check that your client is registered correctly by opening the Uyuni Web UI and navigating to Systems Overview to ensure the new client is listed. If you used the script to register the Salt client, open the Uyuni Web UI and navigate to Salt Keys to accept the client key. When new packages or updates are installed on the client using Uyuni, any end user license agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted.

This method uses ports 4505 and 4506 inbound to the server. This method requires no configuration on the Uyuni Server aside from ensuring that these ports are open. This procedure requires that you have installed the venv-salt-minion (Salt bundle) or the salt-minion package on the Salt client before registration.

Handling of Locally assigned Repositories Bootstrapping clients with the Web UI is using Salt SSH to execute the bootstrap process on the client. Salt SSH uses the Salt Bundle and its included Python interpreter. Therefore, no other Python interpreter needs to be installed on the client. As Salt Bundle is shipped with the bootstrap repository, the repository must be created before starting the bootstrap process for the client. A shell script detects the operating system on the client and deploys the Salt Bundle from the appropriate bootstrap repository, using the same logic as the bootstrap script. For more information, see Prepare to Create a Bootstrap Repository. Do not register the Uyuni Server to itself. The Uyuni Server must be managed individually or by using another separate Uyuni Server. For more information about using multiple servers, see Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deployments. Procedure: Registering Clients with the Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. In the Host field, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped. In the SSH Port field, type the SSH port number to use to connect and bootstrap the client. By default, the SSH port is 22. In the User field, type the username to log in to the client. By default, the username is root. To bootstrap the client with SSH, in the Authentication field, check SSH Private Key, and upload the SSH private key to use to log in to the client. If your SSH private key requires a passphrase, type it into the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, or leave it blank for no passphrase. To bootstrap the client with a password, in the Authentication field, check Password, and type the password to log in to the client. In the Activation Key field, select the activation key that is associated with the software channel you want to use to bootstrap the client. For more information, see Activation Keys. OPTIONAL: In the Proxy field, select the proxy to register the client to. By default, the Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking checkbox is selected. This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate. OPTIONAL: Check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. If you check this option, the client is configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other connection method is configured. Click Bootstrap to begin registration. When the bootstrap process has completed, your client is listed at Systems System List. SSH private keys are stored only for the duration of the bootstrapping process. They are deleted from the Uyuni Server as soon as bootstrapping is complete. When new packages or updates are installed on the client using Uyuni, any end user license agreements (EULAs) are automatically accepted. To review a package EULA, open the package details page in the Web UI. Having repositories assigned directly to clients not served by Uyuni is not a common use case. It can cause trouble. Therfore bootstrapping via Salt disables all local repositories at the beginning of the bootstrap process. Later, during every use of the channel state, for example when executing a Highstate or a package installation, all locally assigned repositories are disabled again. All software packages which are used on the clients should come from channels served by Uyuni. For more information about creating a custom channel, see Custom Channels at Custom Channels.","title":"Register Clients with the Web UI","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-webui","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-webui.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Local Repository Locations Repositories are used to collect software packages. When you have access to a software repository, you can install any of the software that the repository provides. You must have at least one repository associated with your software channels in Uyuni to assign clients to the channel and install and update packages on the client. Most default channels in Uyuni are already associated with the correct repositories. If you are creating custom channels, you need to associate a repository that you have access to, or that you have created yourself. For more information about custom repositories and channels, see Custom Channels. You can configure local repositories on clients, to provide packages that are not supplied by Uyuni channels. In most cases, client systems do not require local repositories. Local repositories can lead to problems knowing which packages are available on the client. This can lead to installing unexpected packages. Local repositories are disabled during onboarding. Local repositories will be disabled each time a channel state is executed. For example, when applying the highstate or performing a package action. If local repositories should stay enabled after onboarding, the following pillar must be set for the affected client: Edit the /srv/pillar/top.sls file: base: 'minionid': - localrepos Edit the /srv/pillar/localrepos.sls file: mgr_disable_local_repos: False After a client has completed onboarding, you can add local repositories to these locations: Table 1.

Create Groups 2. Add Clients to Groups 3. Work with Groups You can use system groups to make it easier to manage a large number of clients. Groups can be used to perform bulk actions on clients such as applying updates, configuration channels, salt states, or formulas. You can organize clients into groups in any way that works for your environment. For example, you could organize clients on which operating system is installed, which physical location they are in, or the type of workload they are handling. Clients can be in any number of groups, so you can define your groups in different ways. When you have clients organized into groups, you can perform updates on all clients in one or more groups, or on intersections between groups. For example, you can define one group for all clients with web server software, and another group for all SLES clients. You can then perform updates on all clients with web server software, or use the intersection between the groups, and update all SLES clients with web server software. You need to create some groups before you can use them to organize your clients. Procedure: Creating a New System Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups. Click Create Group. Give your new group a name and a description. Click Create Group to save your group. Repeat for each group you require. You can add individual clients to your groups, or add multiple clients at the same time. Procedure: Adding A Single Client to a Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and click the name of the client to add. Navigate to the Groups Join tab. Check the group to join and click Join Selected Groups. Procedure: Adding Multiple Clients to a Group In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click the name of the group to add clients to. Navigate to the Target systems tab. Check the clients to add and click Add Systems. Procedure: Adding Multiple Clients to a Group with SSM In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and check each client to add, this adds the clients to the system set manager. Navigate to Systems System Set Manager, and go to the Groups tab. Locate the group to join and check Add. Click Alter Membership. Click Confirm to join the clients to the selected group. For more information about the system set manager, see System Set Manager. You can see which clients are in a group by navigating to Systems System Groups, clicking the name of the group, and navigating to the Systems tab. Alternatively, you can see a graphical representation of your system groups by navigating to Systems Visualization Systems Grouping. When you have your clients arranged into groups, you can use your groups to manage updates. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups. The list shows an icon if there are updates available for any of the clients in the group. The list shows a question mark icon if checking the update status is disabled for any of the clients in the group. Click the icon to see more information about the updates available and to apply them to the clients. You can also work with more than one group at a time. Select the groups you want to work with, and click Work with union to select every client in every selected group. Alternatively, you can work on intersections of groups. Select two or more groups, and click Work with intersection to select only those clients that exist in all the selected groups. For example, you might have one group for all clients with web server software, and another group for all SLES clients. The intersection of these groups would be all SLES clients with web server software.","title":"System Groups","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"system-groups","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/system-groups.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Package Locks on Red Hat Enterprise Linux- and Debian-like Systems System locks are used to prevent actions from occurring on a client. For example, a system lock prevents a client from being updated or restarted. This is useful for clients running production software, or to prevent accidental changes. You can disable the system lock when you are ready to perform actions. When a Salt client is locked, or put into blackout mode, no actions can be scheduled, Salt execution commands are disabled, and a yellow banner is displayed on the System Details page. In this mode, actions can be scheduled for the locked client using the Web UI or the API, but the actions fail. The locking mechanism is not available for Salt SSH clients. Procedure: System Locking a Salt Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the System Details page for the client you want to lock. Navigate to the Formulas tab, check the system lock formula, and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas System Lock tab, check Lock system, and click Save. On this page, you can also enable specific Salt modules while the client is locked. When you have made your changes, you might need to apply the highstate. In this case, a banner in the Web UI notifies you. The client remains locked until you remove the system lock formula. For more information about blackout mode in Salt, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/blackout/index.html. Package locking can be used on several clients, but different feature sets are available. You must differentiate between SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE (zypp-based) versus Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Debian clients. Package locks are used to prevent unauthorized installation or upgrades to software packages. When a package has been locked, it shows a padlock icon, indicating that it cannot be installed. Any attempt to install a locked package is reported as an error in the event log. Locked packages cannot be installed, upgraded, or removed, neither through the Uyuni Web UI, nor directly on the client machine using a package manager. Locked packages also indirectly lock any dependent packages. Procedure: Using Package Locks Navigate to the Software Packages Lock tab on the managed system to see a list of all available packages. Select the packages to lock, and click Request Lock. Pick date and time for the lock to activate. By default, the lock is activated as soon as possible. Note that the lock might not activate immediately. To remove a package lock, select the packages to unlock and click Request Unlock. Pick date and time as with activating the lock. Some Red Hat Enterprise Linux- and Debian-like systems have package locking available on Salt clients. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux- and Debian-like systems, package locks are only used to prevent unauthorized upgrades or removals to software packages. When a package has been locked, it shows a padlock icon, indicating that it cannot be changed. Any attempt to change a locked package is reported as an error in the event log. Locked packages cannot be upgraded or removed, neither through the Uyuni Web UI, nor directly on the client machine using a package manager. Locked packages also indirectly lock any dependent packages. Procedure: Using Package Locks On the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 systems, install the yum-plugin-versionlock package as root. On the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems, install the python3-dnf-plugin-versionlock package as root. On Debian systems, the apt tool has the locking feature included. Navigate to the Software Packages Lock tab on the managed system to see a list of all available packages. Select the packages to lock, and click Request Lock. Pick date and time for the lock to activate. By default, the lock is activated as soon as possible. Note that the lock might not activate immediately.

You can view runtime data about Kubernetes images in the Uyuni Web UI, by navigating to Images Image List. The image list table contains three columns: Revision: A sequence number that increments on every rebuild for images built by Uyuni, or on every import for externally built images. Runtime: Overall status of the running instances for each image in registered clusters. Instances: Number of instances running this image across all the clusters registered in Uyuni. You can see a breakdown of numbers by clicking the pop-up icon next to the number. The Runtime column displays one of these status messages: All instances are consistent with SUSE Manager: All the running instances are running the same build of the image as tracked by Uyuni. Outdated instances found: Some of the instances are running an older build of the image. You might need to redeploy the image. No information: The checksum of the instance image does not match the image data contained in Uyuni. You might need to redeploy the image. Procedure: Building an Image In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Images Stores. Click Create to create an image store. Navigate to Images Profiles. Click Create to create an image profile. You will need to use a Dockerfile that is suitable to deploy to Kubernetes. Navigate to Images Build to build an image with the new profile. Deploy the image into one of the registered Kubernetes clusters. You can do this with the kubectl tool. The updated data should now be available in the image list at Images Image List. Procedure: Importing a Previously Deployed Image In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Images Image Stores. Add the registry that owns the image you want to import, if it is not already there.

Automatically Register Guests 2.4. Autoinstall VM Guests 3. Manage VM Guests Xen and KVM virtualized clients can be managed directly in Uyuni. To begin, you need to set up a virtual host on your Uyuni Server. You can then set up autoinstallation using AutoYaST or Kickstart for additional virtual hosts and for virtual guests. This section also includes information about administering virtual guests after they have been installed. The way that you set up Xen or KVM on a VM host depends on operating system you want to use on its associated guests: For SUSE operating systems, see the SLES Virtualization Guide available from https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-virtualization.html. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems, refer to the Red Hat documentation for your version. The Virtualization Host formula will help you with initializing the host. For more information, see Initialize Virtualization Host. Uyuni uses libvirt to install and manage guests. You must have the libvirt-daemon package installed on your host. In most cases, the default settings are sufficient and you do not need to adjust them. However, if you want to access the VNC console on your guests as a non-root user, you need to perform some configuration changes. For more information about how to set up the VNC console, see the documentation for your operating system. You need a bootstrap script on the Uyuni Server. The bootstrap script must include the activation key for your host. We also recommend that you include your GPG key for additional security. For more on creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. When the bootstrap script is ready, use it to register the host with the Uyuni Server. For more information about client registration, see Client Registration. With the Virtualization Host formula, initialize the host: Procedure: Initializing Virtualization Host In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the System Details page for the host, and click the Formulas tab. Select the Virtualization Host formula, and click Save. Click the Virtualization Host subtab. Check the settings, and click Save Formula. Apply the Highstate for the changes to take effect. Restart the salt-minion service to activate the new configuration: systemctl restart salt-minion You can use AutoYaST or Kickstart to automatically install and register Xen and KVM guests. You need an activation key for the VM host you want to register the guests to, and for each guest. The activation key must have the provisioning and Virtualization Platform entitlements. For more information about creating activation keys, see Activation Keys. If you want to automatically register the guests with Uyuni after installation, you need to create a bootstrap script. For more information about creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. You need to create an autoinstallable distribution on the VM host to be able to autoinstall clients from Uyuni. The distribution can be made available from a mounted local or remote directory, or on a loop-mounted ISO image. The configuration of the autoinstallable distribution differs depending on whether you are using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE operating system on your guests. The packages for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation are fetched from the associated base channel. Packages for installing SUSE systems are fetched from the autoinstallable distribution. Therefore, for SUSE systems, the autoinstallable distribution must be a complete installation source. Table 1. Paths for autoinstallable distributions Operating System Type Kernel Location initrd Location Red Hat Enterprise Linux images/pxeboot/vmlinuz images/pxeboot/initrd.img SUSE boot//loader/initrd boot//loader/linux In all cases, ensure that the base channel matches the autoinstallable distribution. Before you begin, ensure you have a installation media available to your VM Host. It can be on a remote resource, a local directory, or a loop-mounted ISO image. Additionally, ensure that all files and directories are world-readable. Procedure: Creating an Autoinstallable Distribution In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions and click Create Distribution. In the Create Autoinstallable Distribution section, use these parameters: In the Distribution Label section, type a unique name for the distribution. Use only letters, numbers, hyphens (-), periods (.), and underscores (_), and ensure the name is longer than four characters. In the Tree Path field, type an absolute path to the installation source. In the Base Channel field, select the channel that matches the installation source. This channel is used as the package source for non-SUSE installations. In the Installer Generation field, select the operating system version that matches the installation source. In the Kernel Options field, type any options to be passed to the kernel when booting for the installation. The install= parameter and the self_update=0 pt.options=self_update parameter are added by default. In the Post Kernel Options section, type any options to be passed to the kernel when booting the installed system for the first time. Click Create Autoinstallable Distribution to save. When you have created an autoinstallable distribution, you can edit it by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Distributions and selecting the distribution you want to edit. Autoinstallation profiles contain all the installation and configuration data needed to install a system. They can also contain scripts to be executed after the installation is complete. Kickstart profiles can be created using the Uyuni Web UI, by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles, clicking Create New Kickstart File, and following the prompts. You can also create AutoYaST or Kickstart autoinstallation profiles by hand. SUSE provides templates of AutoYaST installation files that you can use as a starting point for your own custom files. You will find them at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. If you are using AutoYaST to install SLES, you also need to include this snippet: SLES For more on AutoYaST, see client-configuration:autoinst-profiles.adoc#autoyast. For more on Kickstart, see client-configuration:autoinst-profiles.adoc#kickstart, or refer to the Red Hat documentation for your installation. Procedure: Uploading an Autoinstallation Profile In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and click Upload Kickstart/AutoYaST File. In the Create Autoinstallation Profile section, use these parameters: In the Label field, type a unique name for the profile. Use only letters, numbers, hyphens (-), periods (.), and underscores (_), and ensure the name is longer than six characters. In the Autoinstall Tree field, select the autoinstallable distribution you created earlier. In the Virtualization Type field, select the relevant Guest type (for example, KVM Virtualized Guest. Do not choose Xen Virtualized Host here. OPTIONAL: If you want to manually create your autoinstallation profile, you can type it directly into the File Contents field. If you have a file already created, leave the File Contents field blank. In the File to Upload field, click Choose File, and use the system dialog to select the file to upload. If the file is successfully uploaded, the filename is shown in the File to Upload field. The contents of the uploaded file is shown in the File Contents field. If you need to make edits, you can do so directly. Click Create to save your changes and store the profile. When you have created an autoinstallation profile, you can edit it by navigating to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles and selecting the profile you want to edit. Make the desired changes and save your settings by clicking Create. If you change the Virtualization Type of an existing Kickstart profile, it might also modify the bootloader and partition options, potentially overwriting any custom settings. Carefully review the Partitioning tab to verify these settings before making changes. When you install VM guests automatically, they are not registered to Uyuni. If you want your guests to be automatically registered as soon as they are installed, you can add a section to the autoinstallation profile that invokes a bootstrap script, and registers the guests. This section gives instructions for adding a bootstrap script to an existing AutoYaST profile. For more information about creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. For instructions on how to do this for Kickstart, refer to the Red Hat documentation for your installation. Procedure: Adding a Bootstrap Script to an AutoYaST Profile Ensure your bootstrap script contains the activation key for the VM guests you want to register with it, and that is located on the host at /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap_vm_guests.sh. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Autoinstallation Profiles, and select the AutoYaST profile to associate this script with. In the File Contents field, add this snippet at the end of the file, immediately before the closing tag. Ensure you replace the example IP address 192.168.1.1 in the snippet with the correct IP address for your Uyuni Server: shell http://192.168.1.1/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap_vm_guests.sh Click Update to save your changes. If your AutoYaST profile already contains a section, do not add a second one. Place the bootstrap snippet inside the existing section. When you have everything set up, you can start to autoinstall your VM guests. Each VM host can only install one guest at a time. If you are scheduling more than one autoinstallation, make sure you time them so that the next installation does not begin before the previous one has completed. If a guest installation starts while another one is still running, the running installation is canceled. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Overview, and select the VM host you want to install guests on. Navigate to the Virtualization tab, and the Provisioning subtab. Select the autoinstallation profile you want to use, and specify a unique name for the guest. Choose a proxy if applicable and enter a schedule. To change the guest’s hardware profile and configuration options, click Advanced Options. Click Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish to complete. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to manage your VM Guests, including actions like shutting down, restarting, and adjusting CPU, and memory allocations. To do this, you need your Xen or KVM VM host registered to the Uyuni Server, and have the libvirtd service running on the host. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List, and click on the VM host for the guests you want to manage. Navigate to the Virtualization tab to see all guests registered to this host, and access the management functions.

In this type of installation, a virtual host is installed on the Uyuni Server to manage any number of virtual guests. If you choose to, you can install several virtual hosts to manage groups of guests. The range of capabilities that virtualized clients have depends on the third-party virtualization provider you choose. Xen and KVM hosts and guests can be managed directly in Uyuni. This enables you to autoinstall hosts and guests using AutoYaST or Kickstart, and manage guests in the Web UI. For VMWare, including VMWare vSphere, and Nutanix AHV, Uyuni requires you to set up a virtual host manager (VHM) to control the VMs. This gives you control over the hosts and guests, but in a more limited way than available with Xen and KVM; Uyuni cannot create or edit VMs on VMWare vSphere or Nutanix AHV. Other third-party virtualization providers are not directly supported by Uyuni. However, if your provider allows you to export a JSON configuration file for the VM, you can upload that configuration file to Uyuni and manage it with a VHM.

For more information, see client-configuration:virt-xenkvm.adoc#virt-xenkvm-host. When a client has the Virtualization Host system type, the Virtualization tab is available in the System Details page for the client. The Virtualization tab allows you to create and manage virtual guests, and manage storage pools and virtual networks. You can add virtual guests to your virtualization hosts within the Uyuni Web UI. Procedure: Creating a Virtual Guest In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List, click the name of the virtualization host, and navigate to the Virtualization tab. In the General section, complete these details: In the Guests subtab, click Create Guest. In the Name field, type the name of the guest. In the Hypervisor field, select the hypervisor to use. In the Virtual Machine Type field, select either fully virtualized or para-virtualized. In the Maximum Memory field, type the upper size limit for the guest disk, in MiB. In the Virtual CPU count, type the number of vCPUs for the guest. In the Architecture field, select the emulated CPU architecture to use on the guest. By default, the architecture selected matches the virtual host. In the Auto-installation Profile field, select the auto-installation tool to use to install the guest. Leave this field blank if you do not want to use auto-installation. In the Disks section, complete the details of the virtual disk to use with the client. In the Source template image URL field, ensure you type the path to an operating system image. If you do not do this, your guest is created with an empty disk. In the Networks section, complete the details of the virtual network interface to use with the client. Leave the MAC address field blank to generate a MAC address. In the Graphics section, complete the details of the graphics driver to use with the client. Schedule a time for the guest to be created, and click Create to create the guest. The new virtual guest starts as soon as it has successfully been created. You can add virtual guests on a pacemaker cluster within the Uyuni Web UI, too. Procedure: Creating a cluster managed Virtual Guest Follow the Creating a Virtual Guest procedure on one of the nodes of the cluster with the following additions: Ensure the Define as a cluster resource field is checked. In the Path to the cluster shared folder for VM definitions field, type the path to a folder shared by all cluster nodes where the guest configuration will be stored. Make sure every disk is located on a storage pool shared by all the cluster nodes. Virtual Guests managed by a cluster can be live migrated.","title":"Virtualization","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"virtualization","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/virtualization.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Connecting PAYG instance 1.1. Deleting the instance connection data 2. Instance credential collect status 3. Registering PAYG system as a client 4. Troubleshooting In the three major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure), SUSE: provides customized PAYG product images for SLES, SLES for SAP, etc. operates per-region RMT Servers mirroring repositories for products available as PAYG This document describes how to connect existing PAYG instance to Uyuni server, and gives basic information about credentials collection from the instance. The goal of this connection is to extract authentication data so the Uyuni Server can connect to a cloud RMT host. Then the Uyuni Server has access to products on the RMT host that are not already available with the SUSE Customer Center organization credentials. Before using the PAYG feature ensure: The PAYG instance is launched from the correct SUSE product image (for example, SLES, SLES for SAP, or SLE HPC) to allow access to the desired repositories Uyuni Server has connectivity to the PAYG instance (ideally in the same region) either directly or via a bastion A basic SUSE Customer Center account is required. Enter your valid SUSE Customer Center credentials in Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials. This account is required for accessing the Uyuni client tools for boostrapping regardless of PAYG instances. If you bootstrap the PAYG instance to SUSE Manager, SUSE Manager will disable its PAYG repositories then add repositories from where it mirrored the data from the RMT server. The final result will be PAYG instances acquiring the same repositories from the RMT servers but through the SUSE Manager server itself. Of course repositories can still be setup primarily from SCC. Procedure: Connecting new PAYG instance In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard PAYG, and click Add PAYG. Start with the page section PAYG connection Description. In the Description field, add the description. Move to the page section Instance SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the instance DNS or IP address to connect from Uyuni. In the SSH Port field, enter the port number or use default value 22. In the User field, enter the username as specified in the cloud. In the Password field, enter the password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the instance key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the key passphrase. Authentication keys must always be in PEM format. If you are not connecting directly to the instance, but via SSH bastion, proceed with Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data. Otherwise, continue with Procedure: Finishing PAYG connecting. Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data Navigate to the page section Bastion SSH connection data. In the Host field, enter the bastion hostname. In the SSH Port field, enter the bastion port number. In the User field, enter the bastion username. In the Password field, enter the bastion password. In the SSH Private Key field, enter the bastion key. In the SSH Private Key Passphrase field, enter the bastion key passphrase. Complete the setup process with with Procedure: Finishing PAYG connecting. Procedure: Finishing PAYG connecting To complete adding new PAYG connection data, click Create. Return to PAYG connection data Details page. The updated connection status is displayed on the top section named Information. Connection status is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go screen too. If the authentication data for the instance are correct, the column Status shows \"Credentials successfully updated.\" If the invalid data are entered at any point, the newly created instance is shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > PAYG, with column Status displaying error message. As soon as the authentication data is available on the server, the list of available products is updated. Available products are all versions of the same product family and architecture as the one installed in the PAYG instance. For example, if the instance has the SLES 15 SP1 product installed, SLES 15 SP2, SLES 15 SP3, SLES 15 SP4 and SLES 15 SP5 are automatically shown in Admin > Setup Wizard > Products. Once the products are shown as available, the user can add a product to Uyuni by selecting the checkbox next to the product name and clicking Add product. After the success message you can verify the newly added channels in the Web UI, by navigating to Software > Channel List > All. To monitor the syncing progress of each channel, check the log files in the /var/log/rhn/reposync directory on the Uyuni Server. If a product is provided by both the PAYG instance and one of the SUSE Customer Center subscriptions, it will appear only once in the products list. When the channels belonging to that product are synced, the data might still come from the SCC subscription, and not from the Pay-As-You-Go instance. The following procedure describes how to delete SSH connection data of the instance. Procedure: Deleting connection data to instance Open Admin > Setup Wizard > PAYG. Find the instance on the list of existing instances. Click on the instance details. Select Delete and confirm your selection. You are returned to the list of instances. The one that was just deleted is no longer shown. Uyuni server uses credentails collected from the instance to connect to the RMT server and to download the packages using reposync. These credentials are refreshed every 10 minutes by taskomatic using the defined SSH connection data. Connection to RMT server always uses the last known authentication credentials collected from the PAYG instance. The status of the PAYG instance credentials collect is shown in the column Status or on the instance details page. When the instance is unreachable, the credential update process will fail and the credentials will become invalid after the second failed refresh. Synchronization of channels will fail when the credentials are invalid. To avoid this keep the connected instances running. PAYG instance remains connected to Uyuni server unless SSH connection data is explicitly deleted. To delete the SSH connection data to the instance, use Procedure: Deleting connection data to instance. PAYG instance may not be accessible from the Uyuni server at all times. If the instance exists, but is stopped, the last known credentials will be used to try to connect to the instance. How long the credentials remain valid depends on the cloud provider. If the instance no longer exists, but is still registered with SUMA, its credentials are no longer valid and the authentication will fail. The error message is shown in the column Status. The error message only indicates that the instance is not available. Further diagnostics about the status of the instance needs to be done on the cloud provider. Any of the following actions or changes in the PAYG instance will lead to credentials failing: * removing zypper credentials files * removing the imported certificates * removing cloud-specific entries from /etc/hosts You can register a PAYG instance from where you harvest the credentials as a Salt client. The instance needs to have a valid cloud connection registered, otherwise it will not have access to channels. If the user removes the cloud packages, the credentials harvesting may stop working. First set up the PAYG instance to collect authentication data, so it can synchronize the channels. The rest of the process is the same as for any non-public-cloud client and consists of synchronizing channels, automatic bootstrap script creation, activation key creation and starting the registration. For more about registering clients, see Client Registration. Checking the credentials If the script fails to collect the credentials, it should provide a proper error message in the logs and in the Web UI. If the credentials are not working, reposync should show the proper error. Using registercloudguest Refreshing or changing the registercloudguest connection to the public cloud update infrastructure should not interfere with the credentials usage. Running `registercloudguest --clean will cause problems if no new cloud connection is registered with the cloud guest command.","title":"Connect PAYG instance","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"connect-payg","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/connect-payg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

If you are already using PostgreSQL 14, you do not need to perform this migration. If you want to upgrade to the latest Uyuni version, you must be using PostgreSQL version 13, 14, or 15 depending on the underlying operating system: If you are running openSUSE Leap 15.3, use PostgreSQL 13. If you are running openSUSE Leap 15.4, use PostgreSQL 14. If you are running openSUSE Leap 15.5, use PostgreSQL 14. Before you begin the upgrade, prepare your existing Uyuni Server and create a database backup. PostgreSQL stores data at /var/lib/pgsql/data/. Procedure: Preparing to Upgrade Check the active PostgreSQL version: psql --version Check the active smdba version: rpm -q smdba PostgreSQL 14 requires smdba version 1.7.6 or later. Perform a database backup. For more information on backing up, see Backup and Restore. Always create a database backup before performing a migration. PostgreSQL upgrades can be performed in two ways: a regular upgrade, or a fast upgrade: A regular upgrade creates a complete copy of the database, so you need double the existing database size of space available. Regular upgrades can take a considerable amount of time, depending on the size of the database and the speed of the storage system. A fast upgrade only takes a few minutes, and uses almost no additional disk space. However, if a fast upgrade fails, you must restore the database from the backup. A fast upgrade reduces the risk of running out of disk space, but increases the risk of data lose when a backup does not exist or cannot be replayed. A regular upgrade will copy the database files instead of creating hard links between the files. PostgreSQL stores data at /var/lib/pgsql/data/. Before running the DB upgrade make sure that the PostgreSQL user exists on the system. The /etc/passwd entry should look as follows: postgres:x:26:26:PostgreSQL Server:/var/lib/pgsql:/bin/bash Procedure: Performing a Regular Upgrade Perform a database backup. For more information on backing up, see Backup and Restore. Start the upgrade. Run the script: /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/pg-migrate-x-to-y.sh When the upgrade has successfully completed, you can safely delete the old database directory and reclaim lost disk space. The old directory is renamed to /var/lib/pgsql/data-pg12 or /var/lib/pgsql/data-pg10, depending on the version you started from. The pg-migrate-x-to-y.sh script performs these operations: Stop spacewalk services Shut down the running database Check if the latest PostgreSQL is installed and install it if necessary Switch from previous version of PostgreSQL to the latest as the new default Initiate the database migration Create a PostgreSQL configuration file tuned for use by Uyuni Start the database and spacewalk services If the upgrade fails, the migration script will attempt to restore the database to its original state.

Storage Devices and Permissions This table outlines hardware and software requirements for the Uyuni Server and Proxy on x86-64 architecture. For Uyuni for Retail hardware requirements, see Retail Requirements. Uyuni Server stores packages in the /var/spacewalk/ directory. Repository synchronization fails if this directory runs out of disk space. You can estimate how much space the /var/spacewalk/ directory requires based on the clients and repositories you plan to mirror. Table 1. Server Hardware Requirements for x86-64 Architecture Hardware Details Recommendation CPU - Minimum 4 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores (x86-64) RAM Test or Base Installation Minimum 16 GB Production Server Minimum 32 GB Disk Space / (root directory) Minimum 40 GB /var/lib/pgsql Minimum 50 GB /var/spacewalk Minimum storage required: 100 GB (this will be verified by the implemented check) * 50 GB for each SUSE product and Package Hub * 360 GB for each Red Hat product /var/cache Minimum 10 GB. Add 100 MB per SUSE product, 1 GB per Red Hat or other product. Double the space if the server is an ISS Master. Swap space 3 GB Uyuni performance depends on hardware resources, network bandwidth, latency between clients and server, etc. Based on the experience and different deployments that are in use, the advice for optimal performance of Uyuni Server with an adequate number of proxies is to not exceed 10,000 clients per single server. It is highly recommended to move to the Hub setup and involve consultancy when you have more than 10,000 clients. Even with fine-tuning and an adequate number of proxies, such a large number of clients can lead to performance issues. For more information about managing a large number of clients, see Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deployments. Table 2. Proxy Hardware Requirements Hardware Details Recommendation CPU Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores RAM Test Server Minimum 2 GB Production Server Minimum 8 GB Disk Space / (root directory) Minimum 40 GB /srv Minimum 100 GB /var/cache (Squid) Minimum 100 GB Uyuni Proxy caches packages in the /var/cache/ directory. If there is not enough space available in /var/cache/, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages. As a result of this behavior: The larger /var/cache/ directory is on the proxy, the less traffic there will be between it and the Uyuni Server. By making the /var/cache/ directory on the proxy the same size as /var/spacewalk/ on the Uyuni Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization. The /var/cache/ directory can be small on the Uyuni Server compared to the proxy. For a guide to size estimation, see the Server Hardware Requirements section. We recommend that the repositories and the database for Uyuni are stored on separate storage devices. This will help to avoid data loss. You must set up the storage devices before you run the YaST Uyuni setup procedure. Uyuni requires three different volumes: Database volume: /var/lib/pgsql Channel volume: /var/spacewalk Cache: /var/cache We recommend you use XFS as the filesystem type for all volumes. Additionally, for on-premise installations, consider using logical volume management (LVM) to manage the disks. The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with Uyuni. See the tables in this section for guides to estimate the size required. On your Uyuni Server, use this command to find all available storage devices: hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" Use the lsblk command to see the name and size of each device. Use the suma-storage command with the device names to set up the external disks as the locations for the database and repositories: suma-storage [] The external storage volumes are set up as XFS partitions mounted at /manager_storage and /pgsql_storage. It is possible to use the same storage device for both channel data and the database. This is not recommended, as growing channel repositories might fill up the storage, which poses a risk to database integrity. Using separate storage devices may also increase performance. If you want to use a single storage device, run suma-storage with a single device name parameter. If you are installing a proxy, the suma-storage command only takes a single device name parameter and will set up the external storage location as the Squid cache. When you create disk partitions for the Uyuni Server and Proxy, ensure you set the permissions correctly. For /var/lib/pgsql: Owner: Read, Write, Execute Group: Read, Execute User: None For /var/spacewalk: Owner: Read, Write, Execute Group: Read, Write, Execute User: Read, Execute Check the permissions with this command: ls -l /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk The output should look like this: drwxr-x--- 1 postgres postgres /var/lib/pgsql drwxrwxr-x 1 wwwrun www /var/spacewalk If required, change the permissions with these commands: chmod 750 /var/lib/pgsql chmod 775 /var/spacewalk And owners with: chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql chown wwwrun:www /var/spacewalk","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The database storage disk should have: At least 50 GB for /var/lib/pgsql At least 50 GB for each SUSE product in /var/spacewalk At least 360 GB for each Red Hat product in /var/spacewalk You will need to ensure you have sufficient disk storage for Uyuni before running yast2 susemanager_setup. By default, the Uyuni file system, including the embedded database and patch directories, reside within the root directory. While adjustments are possible when installation is complete, it is important that you specify and monitor these adjustments closely. For information on storage management and reclaiming disk space, see the troubleshooting section in the Uyuni Administration Guide. If your Uyuni runs out of disk space, this can have a severe impact on its database and file structure. A full recovery is only possible with a previous backup or a new Uyuni installation. SUSE technical services will not be able to provide support for systems suffering from low disk space conditions. Network Requirements: OSA Express Ethernet (including Fast and Gigabit Ethernet) HiperSockets or Guest LAN 10 GBE, VSWITCH RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) These interfaces are still included but no longer supported: CTC or virtual CTC IP network interface for IUCV The z/VM guest you want to run Uyuni from will require a static IP address and hostname before you begin, as these cannot easily be changed after initial installation. The hostname should contain less than eight characters and must not contain any upper case letters. This section covers the installation of Uyuni as a product of the SUSE Linux Enterprise family. For general information about deploying a product on IBM Z hardware, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-zseries.html.

If you want to install SUSE Manager Proxy on a virtual machine, ensure your virtual machine has enough disk space and RAM by checking the requirements at Hardware Requirements. Uyuni Proxy is the Uyuni component that caches software packages on an internal server. The proxy also caches patch updates from SUSE or custom RPMs generated by third-party organizations. A proxy allows you to use bandwidth more effectively because client systems connect to the proxy for updates, and the Uyuni server is no longer required to handle all client requests. The proxy also supports transparent custom package deployment. Uyuni Proxy is an open source (GPLv2) solution that provides the following features: Cache software packages within a Squid proxy. Client systems see the SUSE Manager Proxy as the Uyuni server instance. The SUSE Manager Proxy is registered as a client system with the Uyuni server. The primary goal of a SUSE Manager Proxy is to improve Uyuni performance by reducing bandwidth requirements and accelerating response time.

To install them run: zypper in helm mgrpxy Procedure: Installation of container utility tool mgrpxy for Uyuni Proxy Assign Containers Module software channel to the container host in the Uyuni. For more information about assigning software channels to the system, see Channel management. Log in as root on the container host. Manually install mgrpxy package: zypper install mgrpxy Uyuni Proxy containers require some volumes to be mounted for long term storage. Those volumes are automatically created by podman and can be listed using the podman volume ls command. By default, podman stores the files of the volumes in /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. The volumes are named: uyuni-proxy-squid-cache uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache uyuni-proxy-tftpboot To override default volume settings, create the volumes prior to the first start of the pod using the podman volume create command. To install the systemd service starting the Uyuni proxy, run the mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz command. It is possible to add custom arguments passed to podman container pod with the one or more --podman-arg parameters to the install command. It is possible to modify the tag to use for container images with the --tag=latest parameter to the install command. Changing the containers images and version parameters is dangerous and can cause a non-functional system. By default, the Uyuni Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services. However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with -tag and -image. For example, use it like this: mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds is the image to use and 0.1.0 is the version tag, before restarting it. To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters: mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it. Uyuni Proxy containers work as so called node-port service. This means proxy container pod shares container host network TCP and UDP port space. For this reason container host firewall must be configured to accept incoming traffic on ports used by Uyuni Proxy containers. Those ports are: 69/UDP - TFTP 80/TCP - HTTP 443/TCP - HTTPS 4505/TCP - Salt 4506/TCP - Salt 8022/TCP - SSH Continue with setting up the installed Uyuni Proxy as a containers at Containerized Uyuni Proxy Setup.","title":"Install containerized Uyuni Proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"proxy-container-installation","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/proxy-container-installation.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

There are two ways how to generate Uyuni configuration: use the Web UI or the spacecmd command. Procedure: Generating Of Container Services Configuration using Web UI In the Web UI, navigate to Systems Proxy Configuration and fill the required data: In the Proxy FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the proxy. In the Parent FQDN field type fully qualified domain name for the Uyuni Server or another Uyuni Proxy. In the Proxy SSH port field type SSH port on which SSH service is listening on Uyuni Proxy. Recommended is to keep default 8022. In the Max Squid cache size [MB] field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Typically this should be at most 60% of available storage for the containers. In the SSL certificate selection list choose if new server certificate should be generated for Uyuni Proxy or an existing one should be used. You can consider generated certificates as Uyuni builtin (self signed) certificates. Depending on the choice then provide either path to signing CA certificate to generate a new certificate or path to an existing certificate and its key to be used as proxy certificate. The CA certificates generated on the server are stored in the /root/ssl-build directory. For more information about existing or custom certificates and the concept of corporate and intermediate certificates, see Import SSL Certificates. Click Generate to register new proxy FQDN in Uyuni Server and generate configuration archive with details for container host. After a few moments you are presented with file to download.

In such a case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy will share some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. Copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy. As root, enter the following commands on the proxy using your Uyuni Server or parent Proxy (named PARENT): mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate.

Execute the interactive configure-proxy.sh script. Pressing Enter without further input will make the script use the default values provided between brackets []. Here is some information about the requested settings: Uyuni Parent The Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or the Uyuni Server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Use SSL For safety reasons, press Y. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. To enable PXE boot through a proxy, additional software must be installed and configured on both the Uyuni Proxy and the Uyuni Server. On the Uyuni Proxy, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the Uyuni Proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the Uyuni Server, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the Uyuni Server, run configure-tftpsync.sh. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy Start an initial synchronization on the Uyuni Server: cobbler sync It can also be done after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about autoinstallation powered by Cobbler, Operating System Installation. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone that contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" You can replace a proxy at any time, as it does not store any information about the clients that are connected to it. This process is handled using a reactivation key, which prevents you from losing the history of the proxy. If you do not use a reactivation key, the replacement proxy will become a new one with a new ID. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. During the installation of the proxy, clients will not be able to reach the Uyuni Server. After you have deleted a proxy, the systems list can be temporarily incorrect. All clients that were previously connected to the proxy will show as being directly connected to the server instead. After the first successful operation on a client, such as execution of a remote command or installation of a package or patch, this information will automatically be corrected. This may take some hours. Shut down the old proxy, and leave it installed while you prepare the replacement. Create a reactivation key for this system and then register the new proxy using the reactivation key. If you do not use the reactivation key, you will need to re-register all the clients against the new proxy. Procedure: Replacing a proxy and keeping the clients registered Before starting the migration, save the data from the old proxy, if needed. Consider copying important or custom data to a central place that can also be accessed by the new proxy. Shut down the old proxy. In the Web UI, create a reactivation key for the old proxy system. On the System Details tab of the old proxy click Reactivation. Click Generate New Key, and make a note of the new key. In the Web UI, navigate to Salt Keys, locate the Salt key associated with the old proxy, and click delete. Install a new Uyuni Proxy. For installation instructions, see Proxy Installation. Register the new proxy with a bootstrap script as described in SUSE Manager Proxy Registration. In the bootstrap script, set the reactivation key with the REACTIVATION_KEY parameter. Restore the proxy data from the backup you made earlier. See step 1 of this procedure. For more information about using reactivation keys, see Activation Keys. After the installation of the new proxy, you might also need to: Copy the centrally saved data to the new proxy system Install any other needed software Set up TFTP synchronization if the proxy is used for autoinstallation If you need to distribute big files such as ISO images to your network through the proxy, go to PROXY_HOSTNAME system and copy the big files to the /srv/www/htdocs/pub directory.

Network requirements 2. Prepare storage volumes This section provides the requirements for installing Uyuni on public cloud infrastructure. We have tested these instructions on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but they should work on other providers as well, with some variation. Before you begin, here are some considerations: The Uyuni setup procedure performs a forward-confirmed reverse DNS lookup. This must succeed in order for the setup procedure to complete and for Uyuni to operate as expected. It is important to perform hostname and IP configuration before you set up Uyuni. Uyuni Server and Proxy instances need to run in a network configuration that provides you control over DNS entries, but cannot be accessed from the internet at large. Within this network configuration DNS resolution must be provided: hostname -f must return the fully qualified domain name (FQDN). DNS resolution is also important for connecting clients. DNS is dependent on the cloud framework you choose. Refer to the cloud provider documentation for detailed instructions. We recommend that you locate software repositories, the server database, and the proxy squid cache on an external virtual disk. This prevents data loss if the instance is unexpectedly terminated. This section includes instructions for setting up an external virtual disk. When you use Uyuni on a public cloud, you must use a restricted network. We recommend using a VPC private subnet with an appropriate firewall setting. Only machines in your specified IP ranges must be able to access the instance. Running Uyuni on the public cloud means implementing robust security measures. It is essential to limit, filter, monitor, and audit access to the instance. SUSE strongly advises against a globally accessible Uyuni instance that lacks adequate perimeter security. To access the Uyuni Web UI, allow HTTPS when configuring the network access controls. This allows you to access the Uyuni Web UI. In EC2 and Azure, create a new security group, and add inbound and outbound rules for HTTPS. In GCE, check the Allow HTTPS traffic box under the Firewall section. We recommend that the repositories and the database for Uyuni are stored on separate storage devices to the root volume. This will help to avoid data loss. Do not use logical volume management (LVM) for public cloud installations. You must set up the storage devices before you run the YaST Uyuni setup procedure. The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with Uyuni. When you attach the virtual disks, they will appear in your instance as Unix device nodes. The names of the device nodes will vary depending on your provider, and the instance type selected. Ensure the root volume of the Uyuni Server is 100 GB or larger. Add an additional storage disk of 500 GB or more, and choose SSD storage if you can. The cloud images for Uyuni Server use a script to assign this separate volume when your instance is launched. When you launch your instance, you can log in to the Uyuni Server and use this command to find all available storage devices: hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" If you are not sure which device to choose, use the lsblk command to see the name and size of each device. Choose the name that matches with the size of the virtual disk you are looking for. You can set up the external disk with the suma-storage command. This creates an XFS partition mounted at /manager_storage and uses it as the location for the database and repositories: /usr/bin/suma-storage","title":"Public Cloud Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"pubcloud-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/pubcloud-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For more information about setting up your Uyuni Server, see SUSE Manager Server Setup. Use the Uyuni Web UI to add the required software products, and schedule a repository synchronization. The best way to do this is to navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and follow the prompts. For more information about the setup wizard, see Setup Wizard. If you are intending to register Ubuntu or Red Hat Enterprise Linux clients, you need to set up custom repositories and channels. For more information, see the relevant section in Client Registration. To synchronize your channels, navigate to Software Manage Channels. Click each channel you created, navigate to the Repositories Sync tab, and click Sync Now. You can also schedule synchronization from this screen. Before bootstrapping a client, make sure all the selected channels for that product are synchronized. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours, in particular for openSUSE, SLES ES, and RHEL channels. When you have your Uyuni Server set up, you are ready to start registering clients.

Set up Uyuni with external database This section covers Uyuni Server setup, using these procedures: Start Uyuni setup with YaST Create the main administration account with the Uyuni Web UI Name your base organization and add login credentials Synchronize the SUSE Linux Enterprise product channel from SUSE Customer Center Set up Uyuni with external database Uyuni is part of the SUSE Linux Enterprise product family and thus compatible with the software shipped with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Uyuni is a complex system, and therefore installing third party software is not allowed. Installing monitoring software provided by a third party vendor is allowed only if you do not exchange basic libraries such as SSL, cryptographic software, and similar tools. As part of providing product support, SUSE reserves the right to ask to remove any third party software (and associated configuration changes) and then to reproduce the problem on a clean system. Do not register the Uyuni Server to itself. The Uyuni Server must be managed individually or by using another separate Uyuni Server. For more information about using multiple servers, see Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deployments. This section guides you through Uyuni setup using YaST. Procedure: Uyuni Setup On the Uyuni Server, at the command line, use the yast2 susemanager_setup command to begin setup. From the introduction screen select SUSE Manager Setup Setup SUSE Manager from scratch and click Next to continue. Enter an email address to receive status notifications and click Next to continue. Uyuni can sometimes send a large volume of notification emails. You can disable email notifications in the Web UI after setup, if you need to. For more information on disabling email notifications, see User Details. Enter your certificate information and a password. If you intend to use a custom SSL certificate, you need to have set this up first. For more information about SSL certificates, see SSL Certificates. Click Next to continue. From the SUSE Manager Setup Database Settings screen, enter a database user and password and click Next to continue. Click Next to continue. Click Yes to run setup when prompted, and wait for it to complete. Click Next to continue. Take a note of the address of the Uyuni Web UI. Click Finish to complete Uyuni setup. When you create your certificate password, ensure it is at least seven characters in length. It must not contain spaces, single or double quotation marks (' or \"), exclamation marks (!), or dollar signs ($). Always store your passwords in a secure location. Without this password it will not be possible to set up the Uyuni Proxy. This section guides you through creating your organization’s main administration account for Uyuni. The main administration account is the highest authority account within Uyuni and therefore account access information should be stored in a secure location. For security it is recommended that the main administrator creates low level admin accounts designated for administration of organizations and individual groups. Newer browser versions can block web access to the Uyuni Server FQDN in case the user enabled HSTS. Installing the CA certificate from the pub directory via HTTP and importing it to the browser will then allow access to the server: On the server, go to http://.example.com/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT. Import the certificate file. In the browser settings (for Firefox), open Privacy & Security Certificates View Certificates, and import the file. Procedure: Setting Up the Main Administration Account In the browser, enter the address provided after completing setup. With this address you open the Uyuni Web UI. In the Web UI, navigate to the Create Organization Organization Name field and enter your organization name. In the Create Organization Desired Login and Create Organization Desired Password fields, enter your username and password. Fill in the Account Information fields including an email for system notifications. Click Create Organization to finish creating your administration account. You are now presented with the Uyuni Home Overview page. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC clients may receive updates, and be organized into groups and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in SUSE Manager. In previous versions, so-called mirror credentials were used instead. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the SUSE Manager Web UI: Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the SUSE Manager Web UI, select Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. In the dialog, enter Username and Password, and confirm with Save. When the credentials are confirmed with a check-mark icon, proceed with Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center. Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This operation could take up to a few minutes. You can monitor the progress of the operation in section on the right Refresh the product catalog from SUSE Customer Center. The table of products lists architecture, channels, and status information. For more information, see Wizard. Use Filter by product description and Filter by architecture to filter the liste of displayed products. If your SUSE Linux Enterprise client is based on x86_64 architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products to start product synchronization. After adding the channel, Uyuni will schedule the channel to be synchronized. This can take a long time as Uyuni will copy channel software sources from the SUSE repositories located at SUSE Customer Center to local /var/spacewalk/ directory of your server. In some environments, Transparent Huge Pages provided by the kernel may slow down PostgreSQL workloads significantly. To disable Transparant Huge Pages set the transparent_hugepage kernel parameter to never. This has to be changed in /etc/default/grub and added to the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, for example: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts elevator=none transparent_hugepage=never\" To write the new configuration run grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg. Monitor the channel synchronization process in real-time by viewing channel log files located in the directory /var/log/rhn/reposync: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can continue with client registration. For more instructions, see Client Registration. In this example, we use RDS product from Amazon Web Service. Currently, configuring an external database is not supported by yast2 setup. You can configure an external database using the mgr-setup command line tool. This section guides you through Uyuni setup using mgr-setup. Procedure : Configuring server with external database Create setup_env.sh file in the /root directory. Set the variables defining your certificate information and password. For more information about certificates, see Procedure: Uyuni Setup.

Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel. Create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Create a bootstrap script for the proxy, and adjust it. Add the GPG key to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Alternatively, in the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to System Bootstrapping. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. For setting up a registered Uyuni Proxy, see Uyuni Proxy Setup.","title":"Uyuni Proxy Registration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"uyuni-proxy-registration","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/uyuni-proxy-registration.html","titles":[]},"200":{"id":200,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Configure DHCP for PXE through Proxy 5. Replace the Uyuni Proxy Uyuni Proxy requires additional configuration. Check that the Proxy pattern is installed correctly. This step is part of Install Uyuni Proxy with openSUSE Leap. To verify a successful installation, on the server select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service will be automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. Proxy Chains It is possible to arrange proxies in a chain. In such a case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy will share some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. Copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy. As root, enter the following commands on the proxy using your Uyuni Server or parent Proxy (named PARENT): mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. The configure-proxy.sh script finalizes the setup of your Uyuni Proxy. Execute the interactive configure-proxy.sh script. Pressing Enter without further input will make the script use the default values provided between brackets []. Here is some information about the requested settings: Uyuni Parent The Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or the Uyuni Server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Use SSL For safety reasons, press Y. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. To enable PXE boot through a proxy, additional software must be installed and configured on both the Uyuni Proxy and the Uyuni Server. On the Uyuni Proxy, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the Uyuni Proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the Uyuni Server, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the Uyuni Server, run configure-tftpsync.sh. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy Start an initial synchronization on the Uyuni Server: cobbler sync It can also be done after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. Shut down the old proxy, and leave it installed while you prepare the replacement. Create a reactivation key for this system and then register the new proxy using the reactivation key. If you do not use the reactivation key, you will need to re-register all the clients against the new proxy. The reactivation key is only needed if you do not want to lose the history of the machine. If you do not use a reactivation key, the replacement proxy will become a \"new\" one with a new ID. Procedure: Replacing a Proxy and Keeping the Clients Registered Before starting the actual migration procedure, save the data from the old proxy, if needed. Consider copying important or manually created data to a central place that can also be accessed by the new proxy. Shut down the proxy. Install a new Uyuni Proxy. For installation instructions, see Proxy Installation. In the Uyuni Web UI, select the newly installed Uyuni Proxy, and delete it from the systems list. In the Web UI, create a reactivation key for the old proxy system: On the System Details tab of the old proxy click Reactivation. Click Generate New Key, and make a note of the new key, as you will need it later. For more information about reactivation keys, see Reactivation Keys. OPTIONAL: After the installation of the new proxy, you might also need to: Copy the centrally saved data to the new proxy system Install any other needed software Set up TFTP synchronization if the proxy is used for autoinstallation During the installation of the proxy, clients will not be able to reach the Uyuni Server. After you have deleted a proxy, the systems list can be temporarily incorrect. All clients that were previously connected to the proxy will show as being directly connected to the server instead. After the first successful operation on a client, such as execution of a remote command or installation of a package or patch, this information will automatically be corrected. This may take some hours.","title":"Uyuni Proxy Setup","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"uyuni-proxy-setup","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/uyuni-proxy-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

When you have completed the Uyuni Web UI setup, you are taken to the Home Overview page. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the SUSE Manager Web UI, navigate to Main Menu Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This table lists architecture, channels, and status information. For more information, see Wizard. If your SUSE Linux Enterprise client is based on x86_64 architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products to start product synchronization. After adding the channel, Uyuni will schedule the channel to be synchronized. This can take a long time as Uyuni will copy channel software sources from the SUSE repositories located at SUSE Customer Center to local /var/spacewalk/ directory of your server. In some environments, transparent huge pages provided by the kernel can slow down PostgreSQL workloads significantly. To disable transparent huge pages, set the transparent_hugepage kernel parameter to never. You will also need to open the /etc/default/grub file and add or edit the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. For example: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"resume=/dev/sda1 splash=silent quiet showopts elevator=none transparent_hugepage=never\" To write the new configuration run grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg. Monitor the channel synchronization process in real-time by viewing channel log files located in the directory /var/log/rhn/reposync: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can continue with client registration.

Use case 2. Outcome 3. Preparation 4. Step-by-step workflow instructions 5. Related topics Uyuni is all about managing client systems. So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients. This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see Supported Client Systems. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see Client Registration Methods. Procedure: Configure a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on your client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.suma.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.suma.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare software channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an activation key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

This workflow shows you how to use the Uyuni Web UI to create a centrally managed configuration file, assign it to a Salt client, and apply the configuration. If you are managing a lot of clients, you probably do not want to manually apply configuration settings to each of them in turn. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a configuration channel containing a configuration file, have assigned clients to the channel, and applied the configuration successfully. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. At least one Salt client registered to your server. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a centrally managed configuration file and a Salt state. You can also use locally managed configuration files and different methods, to get more flexibility in how you manage configuration in your environment.

Related topics If you are managing a lot of clients and you need to apply customized packages to them, you can use content lifecycle management (CLM) to manage your packages. CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients.

Procedure: Create a new CLM project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. Leave the Filters section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example. You can add filters later on if you need to. In the Environment Lifecycle section, create three environments: production, testing, and development. Click Add Environment and complete the name and label for each. For the production environment, leave the Insert before field blank. For the testing environment, in the Insert before field, select production. For the development environment, in the Insert before field, select testing``. Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel -production-. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel -testing-. Click Next to assign the client. Procedure: Promote Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section.

Migration of Salt clients This workflow shows how to automatically complete the task of in-place SUSE Linux Enterprise Server instances upgrade with Uyuni Server. In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade true #if $channel_prefix != \"\" https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #else https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #end if $channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool sle-manager-tools Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration depending on the type of your client. For Salt clients, go to Migration of Salt clients. Procedure: Migrating Salt clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time for Salt clients. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console. If your profile is clean, it should complete an in-place migration in about 30 minutes - depending on the speed of your network, client, and the number of required packages in the migration.","title":"In-place upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Related topics This workflow shows how to manually remove SUSE provided channels from Uyuni and to clean up end-of-life products, to reclaim space or for other purposes. Manual channel removal consists of Preparing to remove a channel and Removing channel. Before removing a channel, you must identify the label for the channel to be removed. It can be done with Web UI or on the command line. Be careful not to remove channels that systems are currently subscribed to, or that you are planning on subscribing a system to. If there are systems that are currently subscribed to a channel that you want to delete, do not remove the channel until those systems are upgraded or unsubscribed. Procedure: Identifying channel labels using Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, in the sidebar navigate to Software Channel List All. This page displays the Channel Name. If you select the link for a channel name, you will see the field for Channel Label. Identify the channel, and child channels, to be removed. Procedure: Identifying channel labels using the command line You can get a list of channels by running the following command: spacewalk-remove-channel -l Procedure: Verifying channel system subscriptions using Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, in the sidebar navigate to Software Channel List All. Locate Systems column on the right. Check the Systems column for the channel, or any child channels, that you want to remove. Procedure: Verify channel system subscriptions using the command line Run the following command: spacecmd -- softwarechannel_listsystems A channel, with its metadata, can be removed in the SUMA command line by using the spacewalk-remove-channel command. This command does not remove the packages themselves from the filesystem. Removing packages from the filesystem is described in [cleaning-up-channel-packages]. Procedure: Removing an individual channel using the command line To remove an individual channel run the following command: spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label To remove multiple channels at the same time, use -c flag for each channel, followed by the channel-label. For example: spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label1 -c channel-label2 Procedure: Removing a parent and all its child channels It is also possible to remove a parent channel with all of its child channels, like this: spacewalk-remove-channel -a sles12-sp5-pool-x86_64 Procedure: Remove packages from the database via the Web UI After removing the channel, you need to delete the packages from the database via the Web UI. In the Uyuni Web UI navigate to SUSEManager Software Manage Packages. Select Package in no channel, and delete the packages. Procedure: Clean the packages from the filesystem The following command checks for anything that is still showing in the filesystem, but not in the SUMA database and then removes it. # spacewalk-data-fsck -r -S -C -O The final cleanup command can take several minutes, or even hours to complete.

Install Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap 4. Prepare the Proxy 5. Set Up the Proxy 6. Configure DHCP for PXE through Proxy 7. Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_5 \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see Registering openSUSE Leap Clients. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[]. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL Certificates. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see Install via the Network (PXE Boot). Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Manager Proxy Setup. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

When you have completed the Uyuni Web UI setup, you are taken to the Home Overview page. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save.

Register the openSUSE Leap system 3. Install Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap 4. Prepare the Proxy 5. Set Up the Proxy 6. Configure DHCP for PXE through Proxy 7. Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_5 \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see Registering openSUSE Leap Clients. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see Registering openSUSE Leap Clients. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL Certificates. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see Install via the Network (PXE Boot). Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Manager Proxy Setup. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

Synchronize SCC Repositories With mgr-sync 2. Synchronize Repositories with spacewalk-repo-sync 3. Troubleshooting Synchronization 3.1. Add Custom Extra HTTP Headers There are two tools for synchronizing clients to the server. For clients that are connected to the SUSE Customer Center, use mgr-sync. For all other clients, use spacewalk-repo-sync. The primary use of mgr-sync is to connect to the SUSE Customer Center, retrieve product and package information, and prepare channels for synchronization with the Uyuni Server. This tool is designed for use with a SUSE support subscription. It is not required for open source distributions, including openSUSE, CentOS, and Ubuntu. The available commands and arguments for mgr-sync are listed in this table. Use this syntax for mgr-sync commands: mgr-sync [-h] [--version] [-v] [-s] [-d {1,2,3}] {list,add,refresh,delete} Table 1. mgr-sync Commands Command Description Example Use list List channels, organization credentials, or products mgr-sync list channels add Add channels, organization credentials, or products mgr-sync add channel refresh Refresh the local copy of products, channels, and subscriptions mgr-sync refresh delete Delete existing SCC organization credentials from the local system mgr-sync delete credentials sync Synchronize specified channel or ask for it when left blank mgr-sync sync channel To see the full list of options specific to a command, use this command: mgr-sync --help Table 2. mgr-sync Optional Arguments Option Abbreviated option Description Example Use help h Display the command usage and options mgr-sync --help version N/A Display the currently installed version of mgr-sync mgr-sync --version verbose v Provide verbose output mgr-sync --verbose refresh store-credentials s Store credentials a local hidden file mgr-sync --store-credentials debug d Log additional debugging information.

In most cases, this happens automatically, but you can use the tool to run it manually if required. The spacewalk-repo-sync tool has these primary commands: Table 3. spacewalk-repo-sync Options Option Description Example Use list List all custom channels and the repositories assigned to them. spacewalk-repo-sync --list channel Synchronize a single channel to all repositories assigned to it. spacewalk-repo-sync --channel deep-verify ignore cached package checksums. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify force-all-errata force re-importing all the patches. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify no-packages excludes packages from the operation. spacewalk-repo-sync --deep-verify --no-packages For a complete list of options, see the spacewalk-repo-sync manpage: man spacewalk-repo-sync If you are having trouble synchronizing with spacewalk-repo-sync you can find out more by watching the HTTP log as the command runs. Procedure: Troubleshooting Synchronization Problems Log the HTTP output into /var/log/zypper.log: ZYPP_MEDIA_CURL_DEBUG=2 spacewalk-repo-sync --channel Export the setting: export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG Start the synchronization: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel --type yum You can increase the debug level, by adding the [option]``-vvv`` option to the command. When the complete completes, or fails, disable debug mode: unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG You can add custom HTTP headers to the requests made by spacewalk-repo-sync at the time of synchronization. The custom HTTP headers are defined in the /etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf configuration file. The headers can be defined by repository name or channel label. You can also define global headers by putting them in the main section. For example: [testchannel] X-MY-HEADER-1=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-2=VALUE [mychannel] X-MY-HEADER-3=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-4=VALUE [main] X-MYGLOBAL-HEADER=VALUE This can be particularly useful when dealing with Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repositories in the public cloud.","title":"Synchronization CLI Tools","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"cli-sync","url":"/uyuni/reference/cli-sync.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Comparing containerized and non-containerized workflows 5. Validating Saltboot group configuration To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server 4.3 or newer one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized Uyuni for Retail environment does not use Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using Uyuni Server 4.3 or newer. Older images will not work. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configure DHCP for PXE booting. See DHCPd Formula how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server. Without using DHCP formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. See below for example. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Follow guide System Groups to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. With this, our branch group is converted to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot Groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. See Terminal Names for explanation of possible configurations. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server 4.3 where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is build and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Non-Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with what parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Saltboot Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see Image building and management. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The Saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the Saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the Saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the Saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Image Synchronizing to the Branch Server If you have very large images that you need to synchronize to the branch server, you can use delta images to save network bandwidth. A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be - and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar file in /srv/susemanager/pillar_data/images/. Performance tuning is possible with the -B option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once 2. Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains 3. Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot 4. Configure the Server to Auto-Accept You can configure Uyuni to automatically accept the keys of newly deployed terminals. This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once On the branch server, create a configuration file called /etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key At the command prompt, add the new configuration file to the existing initrd: echo ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf | / cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 11/12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 11 and SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the element, add: Save the file and rebuild the image. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot Configure the PXE formula to specify these kernel parameters during booting: SALT_AUTOSIGN_GRAINS=autosign_key: PXE boot the Salt client. The formula creates the ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf configuration file and passes it to initrd. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept On the Uyuni Server, open the master configuration file in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, and add or edit this line: autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot: For multiple keys, put each one on a new line.

Deploy Terminals over a Wireless Network 2.1. Change Wireless Credentials 2.2. Use Multiple Wireless Networks If you are not able to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if= of= When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. Build the image. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Deploy Images to the Terminals 5. Customize the Terminal Image Download Process When you have the Uyuni Server and Branch Server set up, you are ready to deploy point-of-service terminals by following these steps: Create hardware type groups Assign and configure the Saltboot formula for each hardware type group Synchronize images to the branch server Deploy images to the terminals Each procedure is detailed in this section. For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. For Uyuni 4.2 and later, terminals can be either x86-64 or arm64 architecture. For earlier versions, terminals must be x86 architecture only. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see Image building and management. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync If you have 32-bit machines included in your branch, then you must use a 32-bit boot image as a default boot image. If a 32-bit boot image is not used as a default boot image, 32-bit terminals will be unable to boot and operate properly. Check the available boot images and their architecture from the command line: salt pillar.item boot_images Output: POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0: ---------- arch: x86_64 ... legacy-6.0.0: ---------- arch: i686 In this example, the legacy-6.0.0 boot image is 32-bit. You can set the default boot image in the Image Synchronization formula on the branch server, by adding the chosen boot image name to the Default boot image field. For more information about Image Synchronization formula, see Image Synchronization Formula. When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. Edit the /srv/pillar/top.sls file: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Edit the /srv/pillar/saltboot_proto.sls file: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. Edit the /srv/pillar/top.sls file: base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Edit the /srv/pillar/$branch_prefix.sls file: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin.","title":"Deployment basics","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Partitioning and Image Deployment Formula Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your Uyuni for Retail installation. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to apply common Uyuni formulas. For the most commonly used formulas, see Salt Formulas. All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. If you are unsure of the correct formula configuration details, run the retail_branch_init command before you begin to create the recommended formula configuration. You can then manually edit the formulas as required. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula VSFTP formula, see VsFTPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services. Use the Saltboot formula to specify disk partitioning, and to select which image should be deployed. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula.","title":"Introduction to Retail Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-formulas-intro","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-formulas-intro.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Synchronize Images to the Branch Server To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies, or containerized proxy one or more Uyuni build hosts This section covers how to configure your Uyuni for Retail environment, including: Prepare POS images Prepare system groups Configure services for Saltboot Synchronize POS images to the branch servers The very first time you set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps. You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see Image building and management. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. SLES 11 reached end of life and is no longer supported and can stop working at any moment. POS Terminals based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP 3 can be deployed in much the same way as other terminals, with a few differences. You must use the SLES 11 template SLES 11 images need to be activated with the SLES11 SP3 i586 and SLEPOS 11 SP3 i586 channels Ensure that SLES 11 images are built on the SLES 11 build host. Building on the incorrect build host will cause your build to fail. If you are building images for SLES 11 using profiles from an HTTPS git repository that uses TLS 1.0 or greater, it will fail. SLES 11 does not support later versions of TLS. You will need to clone the repository locally to use it for building. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. For more information about system groups, see System Groups. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible integration. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server ; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server ; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly. For more information about Image Synchronization Formula, see Image Synchronization Formula.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Mass Configuration 1.1. Configure Multiple Branch Servers 2. Terminal Mass Configuration 2.1. Configure Multiple Terminals 3. Export Configuration to Mass Configuration File Mass configuration is possible with branch servers and terminals. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Network Configuration 1.1. Dedicated Network Architecture 1.2. External Network Architecture 1.3. Shared Network Architecture Uyuni for Retail uses a layered architecture: The first layer contains the Uyuni Server. The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services. It also contains one or more build hosts. The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see Install Uyuni Proxy with openSUSE Leap. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements. The branch servers are in the same network as the Uyuni Server, and terminals use an isolated branch network. In this configuration, the branch servers are in the corporate network, and provide all DHCP, DNS, PXE, FTP, and TFTP services to the terminals in the branch networks. The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage.

Cached Terminal Updates If the Uyuni Server is offline, you can still perform some operations on the terminals. This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded. When the terminal is rebooted and an uptodate POS image is found in the service partition, the terminal will automatically use this cached image for system redeployment.","title":"Offline Use","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-offline","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-offline.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains 2. Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values 3. Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call 4. Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Systems provisioned by Saltboot are usually redeployed or repartitioned automatically when a new image is available, or Saltboot partitioning changes. Occasionally, however, it is needed to force Saltboot to redeploy an image or repartition disk, even when automation would not do so. For these situations, Saltboot offers three ways to force redeployment or repartitioning: Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Repartitioning of a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions. Saltboot redeployment grains have no side effects, and do not require any further configuration. The limitation is that terminal must be accessible by salt. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Procedure: Forcing a Saltboot to repartition the hard disk On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_repartition Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Saltboot custom values remove the limitation on terminal being reachable by salt, however there are configuration steps. Custom info keys and values can be also managed using API or spacecmd command. For more information, see custominfo. Procedure: Create custom info key for image redeployment In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Custom System Info. Click Create Key to create new Custom Info Key. As Key Label fill in saltboot_force_redeploy. As Description fill in Force redeploy Saltboot image. Click Create Key. Creating saltboot_force_redeploy custom key is a one time operation. When created, it is available for repeated use. Procedure: Assign custom value for image redeployment Navigate to the Overview page of the system you want to redeploy. Select tab Custom Info. Click on Create Value. From the list of available keys click saltboot_force_redeploy. As Value type True. Click Update Key. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment custom info setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. Procedure: Create custom info key for disk repartitioning Navigate to menu::Systems[Custom System Info] page. Click Create Key to create new Custom Info Key. As Key Label fill in saltboot_force_repartition. As Description fill in Force terminal disk repartition. Click Create Key. Creating saltboot_force_repartition custom key is one time operation.

Click on Create Value. From the list of available keys click saltboot_force_repartition. As Value type True. Click Update Key. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. An API call system.setPillar can be used to set specific Saltboot options through Salt pillar data. Uyuni Saltboot integration is using tuning-saltboot pillar category to manage Saltboot tuning, including forced redeployment or disk repartition. Using this pillar category allows Uyuni to reset Saltboot flag once the terminal is booted up. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image using API call using spacecmd command In the console run following the command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_redeployment\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to repartition disk using API call using spacecmd command In the console run the following command, replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_repartition\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Check Saltboot tuning options In the console run the following command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot' system.getPillar Make sure to use tuning-saltboot as pillar category in the API call. Pillars specified outside of Uyuni database cannot be reset automatically. Without manual intervention, the terminal will download a new image on each reboot. Procedure: Force a Saltboot to redeploy image using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_redeploy.sls with content: saltboot: force_redeploy: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_redeploy Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.

Naming by FQDN 4. Assign Hostnames to Terminals Terminals can be named according to certain parameters, which can make it easier to match the physical device with its record in the Uyuni Web UI. Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, and HWType. Naming scheme can be selected in the Branch Network formula. For more information, see Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID For example: B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID For example: B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID For example: B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: hwAddress: hwtype: Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name.

Register the Branch Server This section covers Uyuni for Retail Branch Server installation and setup, using these procedures: Add Software Channels Check Synchronization Status Trust GPG Keys on Clients Register the Branch Server and Terminals as Clients The Uyuni for Retail Branch Server is a Uyuni Proxy with additional Retail features. For proxy installation procedures, see Install Uyuni Proxy with openSUSE Leap and Uyuni Proxy Setup. Then continue with the following sections. Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. The products you need for this procedure are: Table 1. openSUSE Channels - CLI OS Version openSUSE Leap 15.4 Base Channel opensuse_leap15_4 Client Channel opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-updates Non-OSS Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss Non-OSS Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates Backports Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates SLE Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the spacewalk-common-channels command to add the appropriate channels: spacewalk-common-channels \\ \\ \\ \\ ... Synchronize the channels: mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Software Manage Channels, then click the channel associated to the repository. Navigate to the Repositories tab, then click Sync and check Sync Status. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress from the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni Server, as root, use the tail command to check the synchronization log file: tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Procedure: Trusting GPG Keys on Clients On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. . If you are bootstrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) For more information about creating activation keys, see Activation Keys. You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels For more information on registering your clients, see Client Registration. A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see Uyuni Proxy Registration. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. For more information about the proxy setup script, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc#uyuni-proxy-setup-confproxy[]. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types. Configure the proxy to become a branch server. On the Uyuni for Retail Server, for example, run: retail_branch_init --dedicated-nic eth1 \\ --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \\ --netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \\ --server-domain branch.example.org \\ --branch-prefix uyuni For additional options, use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.","title":"Retail Uyuni Branch Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-uyuni-branchserver","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-uyuni-branchserver.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For example, conflicting packages with higher version numbers could be included into the bootstrap repository. Such packages (for example, python3-zmq or zeromq) may corrupt the creation of the bootstrap repository or cause issues during bootstrap of the client. When the custom channel (for example, an EPEL channel) is added below the parent vendor channel, issues with conflicting packages cannot be solved directly. The way how to solve this is to separate the custom channel from the vendor channel. The custom channel needs to be created in a separate tree. In case that the custom channel needs to be delivered as a child, such environemnt can be created using Content Lifecycle Management (CLM). Sources in a CLM project can be added there from different trees. Using such an approach, the custom channel stays below the parent within the built environment. However, the vendor channel tree stays without the custom channel and the bootstrap repository. Then registering clients works correctly. When the custom channel with the conflicting packages (salt, zeromq, and so on) is created as a child channel, following steps can help to avoid the issue: Procedure: Avoiding Conflicting Packages in Custom Channels Remove the custom channel as a child channel from parent channel. For more information, see administration:custom-channels.adoc#_manage_custom_channels. Create the custom channel in a separate tree. For more information, see administration:custom-channels.adoc#_creating_custom_channels_and_repositories. To get the custom channel as a child channel within Content Lifecycle Management (CLM): In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle, and click Create Project. Enter Name and Label. Attach Source to the project. Use the needed vendor channels and the custom channel. (sharing example using CentOS8) Add environment into the Project. For example, use CentOS8. To build the environment click the Build button. This creates an environment with vendor and custom channels that can be associated with an activation key and used to bootstrap the client. Important note: In the CLM project, it is recommend to add a filter, which excludes the problematic or conflicting packages. Otherwise the conflicting packages with higher version numbers would be installed during the update of the client. For more information about filtering, see administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version. To get the latest patches into the CLM environment (with vendor and custom channel), click the Build button in the project. This is needed to re-built the environment.

If it is set to DROP then you might find that synchronizing with the SUSE Customer Center times out. This occurs because the synchronization process needs to access third-party repositories that provide packages for non-SUSE clients, and not just the SUSE Customer Center. When the Uyuni Server attempts to reach these repositories to check that they are valid, the firewall drops the requests, and the synchronization continues to wait for the response until it times out. If this occurs, the synchronization takes a long time before it fails, and your non-SUSE products are not shown in the product list. You can fix this problem in several different ways. The simplest method is to configure your firewall to allow access to the URLs required by non-SUSE repositories. This allows the synchronization process to reach the URLs and complete successfully. If allowing external traffic is not possible, configure your firewall to REJECT requests from Uyuni instead of DROP. This rejects requests to third-party URLs, so that the synchronization fails early rather than times out, and the products are not shown in the list.

To accomplish this, Cobbler uses a list of proxies specified in /etc/cobbler/settings. Due to its design, cobbler sync is not able to sync only the changed or recently added files. Instead, executing cobbler sync triggers a full sync of the /srv/tftpboot directory to all specified proxies configured in /etc/cobbler/settings. It is also influenced by the latency of the WAN connection between the involved systems. The process of syncing may take a considerable amount of time to finish according to the logs in /var/log/cobbler/. For example, it started at: Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running python triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* and ended at: Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/post/* Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | shell triggers finished successfully The transfer amount was roughly 1.8 GB. The transfer took almost 30 minutes. By comparison, copying a single big file of the same size as /srv/tftboot completes within several minutes. Switching to an rsync-based approach to copy files between Uyuni Server and Proxy may help to reduce the transfer and wait times. A script to accomplish this task is available for download at https://suse.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/1i000000gLOd/a/1i000000ll5B/B2AmvIJN2_JsAyjTQzCVP_x5ioVgd0bYN9X9NpMugS8. The script does not accept command line options. Before running the script, you need to manually edit it and set correctly SUMAHOSTNAME, SUMAIP and SUMAPROXY1 variables for it to work correctly. There is no support available for individual adjustments of the script. The script and the comments inside aim to provide an overview of the process and steps to be taken into consideration. If further help is required, contact SUSE Consulting. The proposed approach using the script is beneficial in the following environment: SUSE Manager Proxy systems are connected via a WAN connection; /srv/tftboot contains a high number of files for distributions and client PXE boot files, in total several thousand files; Any proxy in /etc/cobbler/settings has been disabled, otherwise Uyuni will continue to sync content to the proxies. #proxies: # - \"sumaproxy.sumaproxy.test\" # - \"sumaproxy2.sumaproxy.test\" Procedure: Analyze new sync speed Take a dump of the TCP traffic between Uyuni and the involved systems. On SUSE Manager Server: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh On SUSE Manager Proxy: tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh This will only capture a package size of 200 which is sufficient to run an analysis. Adjust ethX to the respective network interface Uyuni uses to communicate with the proxy. At last, ssh communication will not be captured to reduce the number of packages even further. Start a cobbler sync. To force a sync, delete the Cobbler json cache file first and then issue cobbler sync: rm /var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json cobbler sync When {command]cobbler sync is finished, stop the TCPdumps. Open the TCPdumps using Wireshark, go to Statistics > Conversations and wait for the dump to be analyzed. Switch to the TCP tab. The number shown on this tab gives the total number of conversations captured between SUSE Manager and SUSE Manager Proxy. Look for the column Duration. Start by sorting in ascending order to find out the minimal amount of time it took to transfer a file. Continue by sorting in descending order to find out the maximum values for the big files, for example kernel and initrd transfers. Ignore ports 4505 and 4506 as these are used for Salt communication. Analysis of the TCPdumps showed the transfer of small files with a size of approx. 1800 bytes from Uyuni Server to Proxy took around 0.3 seconds. While there were not many big files, the high number of smaller files resulted high number of established connections as new TCP connection is created for every single transferred file. Therefore, knowing the minimal amount of transfer time and a number of connections needed (approx. 5000 in the example), gives an approximate estimated time for the overall transfer time: 5000 * 0.3 / 60 = 25 minutes.","title":"Troubleshooting high sync times between Uyuni Server and Proxy over WAN connections","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan","url":"/uyuni/administration/troubleshooting/tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan.html","titles":[]},"272":{"id":272,"text":"If you change the hostname of the Uyuni Server locally, your Uyuni installation ceases to work properly.

While cloning VMs can save you a lot of time, the duplicated identifying information on the disk can sometimes cause problems. If you have a client that is already registered, you create a clone of that client, and then try and register the clone, you probably want Uyuni to register them as two separate clients. However, if the machine ID in both the original client and the clone is the same, Uyuni registers both clients as one system, and the existing client data is overwritten with that of the clone. This can be resolved by changing the machine ID of the clone, so that Uyuni recognizes them as two different clients. Each step of this procedure is performed on the cloned client. This procedure does not manipulate the original client, which remains registered to Uyuni.

Trust GPG Keys on Clients 1.1. User defined GPG keys 1.2. GPG Keys in Bootstrap Scripts Operating systems either trust their own GPG keys directly or at least ship them installed with the minimal system. But third party packages signed by a different GPG key need manual handling. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Because Debian based systems sign only metadata, there is no need to specify extra keys for single channels. If a user configures an own GPG key to sign the metadata as described in \"Use Your Own GPG Key\" in Signing Repository Metadata the deployment and trust of that key is executed automatically. Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. By providing some pillar data and providing the GPG key files in the Salt filesystem, they are automatically deployed to the client. These keys are deployed into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ on RPM based operating systems and to /usr/share/keyrings/ on Debian systems: Define the pillar key [literalcustom_gpgkeys for the client you want to deploy the key to and list the names of the key file. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg Additionally in the Salt filesystem create a directory named gpg and store there the GPG key files with the name specified in the custom_gpgkeys pillar data. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg. The last step is to add the URL to the GPG key URL field of the software channel. Navigate to Software Manage Channels and select the channel you want to modify. Add to GPG key URL the value file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key. Procedure: Trusting GPG Keys on Clients Using a Bootstrap Script On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the channel assigned to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. A software channel cannot be assigned to a client when the GPG key is not trusted.","title":"","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"trust_gpg","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/snippets/trust_gpg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Limit Container Capabilities 9. Secure Host Environment 10. Implement Runtime Protection Hardening a container involves implementing security measures to reduce its attack surface and enhance its resilience against potential threats. In this section we have listed techinques commonly used to harden a containers. This list is not comprehensive and container security will depend on your oranizations infrastructure. For more information see, Security and Hardening Guide Uyuni 2024.01 uses SLE Micro 5.5 as its base. This images has fewer pre-installed packages, reducing the potential attack surface. Reduced Size Minimal base images are significantly smaller in size compared to classical operating system images. By removing unnecessary packages and libraries, these images minimize the overall footprint, leading to faster download times and reduced storage requirements. Focused Functionality Minimal base images are designed to provide the essential functionalities needed for running containerized applications. Minimal base images typically include: core system utilities runtime environments (such as the shell) essential libraries Minimal base images typically exclude non-essential components such as: documentation development tools unnecessary daemons. Improved Security By minimizing the number of installed packages and dependencies, minimal base images reduce the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities within the container environment. This enhances security by limiting the avenues through which malicious actors can exploit the system. Flexibility Minimal base images offer greater flexibility for developers to customize and optimize their containerized applications. Since these images contain only the basic necessities, developers have more control over which additional components and dependencies to include, tailoring the container environment to meet specific application requirements. Keep container images up to date with security patches and updates. Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like: Trivy Project Quay Skopeo Use digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of container images. Implement image signing and verification mechanisms to ensure that only trusted images are deployed. Digital Signatures A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to validate the authenticity and integrity of digital content, such as container images. It involves generating a unique hash or checksum of the image content and encrypting it with a private key to produce a signature. This signature can be decrypted using a corresponding public key to verify its authenticity. Private and Public Keys Image signing relies on asymmetric encryption, which involves the use of a pair of cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key. The private key is used to generate the signature, while the public key is used to verify the signature. The private key is kept confidential and securely stored, while the public key can be freely distributed. Trust Model Image signing establishes a trust model where the signer of the image is implicitly trusted to vouch for its authenticity. Organizations typically maintain their own private key for signing images, and users trust images signed by that organization’s key. Image consumers can verify the signature using the corresponding public key to ensure that the image has not been compromised or altered by malicious actors. Registry Integration Image signing is often integrated with container image registries, such as Docker Hub or private registries like Harbor. Registries may offer built-in support for image signing, allowing users to sign and verify images directly within the registry platform. Signed images are typically tagged with metadata indicating their signed status and the identity of the signer. Verification Process Before deploying a container image, the image consumer (e.g., a container runtime or orchestration platform) verifies the image signature using the signer’s public key. If the signature is valid and matches the image content, the image is considered authentic and can be safely deployed. If the signature cannot be verified or does not match the image content, the image is rejected to prevent potential security risks. Run containers with the least privilege principle. Avoid running containers as root whenever possible. Instead, create and use non-root users within containers to limit the impact of potential exploits. Leverage security features provided by container runtimes such as Podman. Configure security contexts to enforce resource limitations, network policies, and SELinux/AppArmor profiles. Implement network segmentation to isolate containers from each other and from the host system. Use container network plugins or overlay networks to enforce network policies and restrict container communications. Employ container runtime monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time. Monitor container logs, file integrity, and system calls for signs of compromise or malicious behavior. Disable unnecessary Linux capabilities within containers to reduce the potential impact of privilege escalation attacks. Use tools like capsh to drop or restrict capabilities as needed. Ensure that the underlying host system is properly secured. Apply operating system patches, configure firewall rules, and implement access controls to protect the host from external threats. Use runtime protection mechanisms such as seccomp or AppArmor profiles to restrict the actions that container processes can perform. Define and enforce granular security policies to prevent unauthorized access or execution of malicious code.","title":"Hardening and improving container security","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"container-security","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-management/container-security.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configuration Channel Details Uyuni manages both central and local configuration channels and files. Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems, by using state channels. When you create a state channel, you can create or upload custom Salt states. For more information about custom states, see Custom Salt States. Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel. If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the List/Remove Files page of that channel. If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the Configuration Channel Details Systems Subscribed Systems page for that channel. Overview The Overview page of the Configuration Channel Details page is divided into several panels: Channel Properties [Management] Edit the name, label, and description of the channel by clicking Edit Properties. Channel Information Provides status information for the contents of the channel. Configuration Actions Provides access to the most common configuration tasks. For Salt clients, there is a link to edit the init.sls file. This panel allows you to deploy, compare, and add and create files. Some action are only availalble if you have files created and clients assigned to configuration channels. List/Remove Files This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel. You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels. Check the box next to files you want to manipulate, then click the action button at the bottom. Add Files The Add Files page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to Upload, Import, or Create configuration files to be included in the channel. Upload File To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the Upload Configuration File button. The Filename/Path field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed. You can set the Ownership via the user name and group name and the Permissions of the file when it is deployed. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure SELinux contexts to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type). If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro. For more information on using macros, see reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros. Import Files To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import. Then click Import Configuration Files. A sandbox icon () indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox. Files in a system’s sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable. Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel. Create File Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link to be included in the configuration channel. Deploy Files This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel. Deploy all files by clicking the Deploy All Files button or check selected files and click the Deploy Selected Files button. Select to which systems the files should be applied. All systems subscribed to this channel are listed. If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first.

Setup spacecmd Credentials 2. spacecmd Quiet Mode 3. spacecmd Help The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help ): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Creating a distribution wiere spacecmd sets localhost instead of FQDN 2. spacecmd not accepting commands or options 3. spacecmd caching problems This section provides troubleshooting solutions when working with spacecmd Situation When creating a distribution with spacecmd it will automatically set localhost as the server name instead of the FQDN of Uyuni. This will result in the following kernel option being written: install=http://localhost/ks/dist/ Resolution Set the FQDN in $HOME/.spacecmd/config like the following: test:~/.spacecmd # cat config [spacecmd] server=test.mytest.env username=admin password=password nossl=0 Cause This problem may be experienced if $HOME/.spacecmd/config has been created and the server name option was set to localhost. When running spacecmd non-interactively: you must escape arguments passed to the command. always put -- before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments. make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted. An example of a well-formed spacecmd command: spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \\'My Channel\\' -l channel1 -a x86_64 The spacecmd command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed. Sometimes, this can result in a mismatch between the system name and the system ID.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block//queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block//queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"495":{"id":495,"text":"Make sure the hub-xmlrpc-api service is started: systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api Once it is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Authentication Examples The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different authentication modes: Manual mode (default): API credentials must be explicitly provided for each server. Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2. Example Python Script for Relay Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # Authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate) client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds) # Perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Auto-Connect Authentication Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers. However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"499":{"id":499,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Tuning Reporting Jobs 4.2. report_db_batch_size 4.3. report_db_hub_workers The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral Uyuni Servers. The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Schema documentation can be found on the Left Navigation Bar → Help Report Database Schema. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Salt Client Onboarding Rate 2. Salt Clients and the RNG 3. Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys 4. Disabling the Salt Mine 5. Disable Unnecessary Taskomatic jobs 6. Swap and Monitoring 7. AES Key Rotation This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments. Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from Salt clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. There is no hard maximum number of supported systems. Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured. There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information see Install Uyuni Proxy from packages. Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use Uyuni for Retail to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals. There is an introduction to Uyuni for Retail in this book. Tuning and monitoring large scale deployments can differ from smaller installations.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

Memory Usage Uyuni is designed by default to work on small and medium scale installations. For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters. Description The maximum number of HTTP requests served simultaneously by Apache httpd. Proxies, Web UI, and XMLRPC API clients each consume one. Requests exceeding the parameter will be queued and might result in timeouts. Tune when User count and proxy count increase significantly and this line appears in /var/log/apache2/error_log: […​] [mpm_prefork:error] [pid …​] AH00161: server reached MaxRequestWorkers setting, consider raising the MaxRequestWorkers setting. Value default 150 Value recommendation 150-500 Location /etc/apache2/server-tuning.conf, in the prefork.c section Example MaxClients = 200 After changing Immediately change ServerLimit and check maxThreads for possible adjustment.

Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. Notes Incoming Salt events are handled in separate thread pool, see java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum number of minions concurrently executing a scheduled action. Tune when Client count reaches several thousands and actions are not executed quickly enough. Value default 200 Value recommendation 200-500 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_batch_size = 300 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information Salt Rate Limiting Description The maximum number of threads in Tomcat dedicated to handling of incoming Salt events. Tune when The number of queued Salt events grows. Typically, this can happen during onboarding of large number of minions with higher value of java.salt_presence_ping_timeout. The number of events can be queried by echo \"select count(*) from susesaltevent;\" | spacewalk-sql --select-mode-direct - Value default 8 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_event_thread_pool_size = 50 After changing Check the length of Salt event queue. Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size, as each thread consumes a PostgreSQL connection, starvation might happen if the allocated connection pool is insufficient. Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. More information man rhn.conf Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. This parameter sets the amount of time before a second command (find_job) is sent to the client to verify its presence. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 4 seconds Value recommendation 4-400 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_timeout = 40 After changing Large java.salt_presence_ping_timeout value can reduce overall throughput. This can be compensated by increasing java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information Salt Timeouts Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. After java.salt_presence_ping_timeout seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (find_job) is sent to the client for a final check. This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered offline. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 1 second Value recommendation 1-100 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 10 More information Salt Timeouts Description Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it. Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count increases significantly (more than 50), or more concurrent operations on channels are expected. Value default 2 Value recommendation 2-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers = 4 After changing Check taskomatic.java.maxmemory for adjustment, as every new thread will consume memory More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum amount of memory Taskomatic can use. Generation of metadata, especially for some OSs, can be memory-intensive, so this parameter might need raising depending on the managed OS mix. Tune when java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers increases, OSs are added to Uyuni (particularly Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu), or OutOfMemoryException errors appear in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log. Value default 4096 MiB Value recommendation 4096-16384 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.java.maxmemory = 8192 After changing Check memory usage. More information man rhn.conf Description The number of Taskomatic worker threads. Increasing this value allows Taskomatic to serve more clients in parallel. Tune when Client count increases significantly Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-200 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 100 After changing Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size and thread_pool for adjustment More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Cycle time for Taskomatic. Decreasing this value lowers the latency of Taskomatic. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 5000 ms Value recommendation 1000-5000 ms Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.scheduler.idleWaitTime = 1000 More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt clients as a result of actions being executed. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 1 Value recommendation 1-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.MinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 10 Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt SSH clients as a result of actions being executed.

Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.SSHMinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 40 Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections simultaneously available to both Tomcat and Taskomatic. If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving. Value default 20 Value recommendation 100 to 200, higher than the maximum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size + maxThreads and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example hibernate.c3p0.max_size = 100 After changing Check max_connections for adjustment. More information https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize Description The maximum amount of memory that the rhn-search service can use. Tune when Client count increases significantly, and OutOfMemoryException errors appear in journalctl -u rhn-search. Value default 512 MiB Value recommendation 512-4096 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example rhn-search.java.maxmemory = 4096 After changing Check memory usage. Description The amount of memory reserved for PostgreSQL shared buffers, which contain caches of database tables and index data. Tune when RAM changes Value default 25% of total RAM Value recommendation 25-40% of total RAM Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example shared_buffers = 8192MB After changing Check memory usage. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation Depends on other settings, use /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/susemanager-connection-check to obtain a recommendation. Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-200 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 50 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Continuous Compliance checks Regardless of the public cloud service you use or the plan you choose, SUSE has you covered with support. Where you get support is dependent on whether you bring your own subscription (BYOS) or you use SUSE products on-demand (PAYG). BYOS BYOS instances are supported by SUSE under the terms of your SUSE subscription. For an overview of SUSE’s support subscriptions, refer to https://www.suse.com/support/.

Public Cloud Guide For more information on cloud products and support, see the SUSE public cloud guide: SUSE Public Cloud Guide Public Cloud Information Tracker (Pint) The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images SUSE publishes and servers that are part of the SUSE operated update infrastructure. PINT is available at pint.suse.com and provided as an API and command-line tool with the python3-susepubliccloudinfo package from the Public Cloud Module repository. To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command supportconfig. The command-line tool is provided by the package supportutils which is installed by default. Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate supportconfig plug-ins. When supportconfig is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. supportconfig plug-ins are stored in the directory /usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/. The following procedure shows how to create a Supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly. Procedure: Creating a supportconfig archive Run supportconfig as root. Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list: Listing 1. Options: -E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E) Company name (-O) Your name (-N) Your phone number (-P) -i KEYWORDS, -F Limits the features to check. The placeholder KEYWORDS is a comma-separated list of case-sensitive keywords. Get a list of all keywords with supportconfig -F. Wait for the tool to complete the operation. The default archive location is /var/log, with the file name format being scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz To open a new support case for your cloud pay-as-you-go instance, you need to generate a supportconfig file and then follow the steps listed on: SUSE Customer Center Cloudsupport Serves billing data from Uyuni for the CSP-billing-adapter.

Enable and Configure the HANA Formula 2. Enable and Configure the Cluster Formula Uyuni uses formulas with forms to configure your SAP clients. There are two formulas that you need to use: Hana to configure the HANA database Cluster to configure the clients into a cluster The formulas are provided by packages that you can download with your package manager. You need to install the formulas on the Uyuni Server. When you have installed the package, you can use the Uyuni Web UI to enable and configure the formulas. As you go through the formula configuration process, provide details of the clients that contain your SAP cluster, to set them up appropriately. To install the formulas on the Uyuni Server, use your package manager to install these packages: saphanabootstrap-formula sapnwbootstrap-formula drbd-formula habootstrap-formula salt-shaptools The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important. You must enable, configure, and apply the HANA formula first. Then you can enable, configure, and apply the cluster formula. If you perform these steps in the wrong order, your SAP installation fails. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and click the client to use as the primary client in the cluster. Navigate to the Formulas tab, locate the Sap Hana Deployment heading, and check the Saphanabootstrap formula in the list. Click Save and apply the highstate to activate the formula. When the formula is activated, navigate to the Formulas Hana tab, and complete the details in the form. Make sure you check Install required packages to install everything you need on the client.

Register Clients to the SUSE Customer Center 2. Configure the Clients for Clustering 3. Create a Shared Storage Device 4. Download the SAP Installation Software 5. Configure Clients to Use Latest module.run 6. Install Additional Disks for HANA 7. Register Clients to the Server Your SAP cluster requires several client systems. Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP4/html/SLES-SAP-installation/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see General Requirements. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see Activation Keys. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. In the Activation Key field, select the SLES for SAP activation key.

The method for installing the Uyuni Server varies depending on your hardware and environment. Uyuni is installed using the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Unified Installer. During the installation process, when you are prompted for which product to install, select Uyuni Server. The server does not need to have the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 with SAP product installed. For more information about installing the Uyuni Server, see Install Uyuni 2024.01 Server. When the Uyuni Server is installed, set it up by running the yast2 susemanager_setup command from the command prompt. The setup script prompts you to complete additional details about your server, and give you the URL to use to access the Web UI. For more information about setup, see SUSE Manager Server Setup. You need to do some configuration to set up the Uyuni Web UI. In your browser, navigate to the URL of the server, and configure your administration access to the Web UI. For more information about setting up the Web UI, see Web Interface Setup. Now you can use the Web UI to prepare software channels and activation keys for your clients. On the Uyuni Server, add the appropriate SAP channels: From the Web UI, add SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP. Synchronize the Uyuni Server with the SUSE Customer Center. You can do this using the Web UI. Add the new channel to your activation key. To check if a channel has finished synchronizing navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and select the Products tab. This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. Software channels can be very large. The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours. When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.

Salt Targets 2. Salt Execution Modules 3. Salt Function Arguments Salt commands have three main components: target, function, and arguments. The calls are constructed in this format: salt 'target' [arguments] The target defines the client, or group of clients, on which to run the function. The function is the particular task to be run. Arguments provide any extra data required by the function. Salt command targets allow you to specify a client or group of clients. There are several different targets you can use.

Custom State to Trust a GPG Key 4. Apply a custom state at highstate You can create your own custom Salt states with Uyuni as centrally managed configuration channels. Custom states are stored as Salt state files on the Uyuni Server with a .sls extension. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create and edit custom Salt state files. You must create a state channel first, with an initial state named init.sls. The init.sls file is used to reference all other state files within the channel. The custom states that you create using the Web UI are stored on the Uyuni Server in the the /srv/susemanager/salt// directory. After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state. If you want to reference file templates in this configuration channel, ensure your file starts by specifying the source of the managed file, using this syntax: file.managed: - source: salt:////etc// Example custom state files are given later in this section. .

Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click btn:Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit .sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2. Example: Package Management my_pkg_id: pkg.installed: - refresh: True - pkgs: - glibc - kernel-default - hello: 1.0-42 Listing 3. Example: Remote Command ip_forward-on: cmd.run: - name: echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - onlyif: - test `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 Listing 4. Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all user public files must be saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey- deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls. This short example maps the test state to the system group 12: # /srv/salt/top.sls base: 'group_ids:12': - match: pillar - test","title":"Custom Salt States","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-custom-states","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-custom-states.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of Saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders. In the Configured Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.com). In the Type field, select master. Click Add item to add a second zone, and set these parameters for Zone 2: In the Name field, use the reverse zone for the configured IP range (for example: com.example.branch1).

Set Up a Branch Server Networking 1.1. Set Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN 1.2. Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network 2. Set up Branch Server Terminal Naming The Branch Network formula is used to configure the networking services required by the branch server, including DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration it is required to fill at least Branch Identification. This identifies Branch Server in Retail subsystem and is also used to better organize terminals with their respective branch servers. Procedure: Setting up a Branch Server Identification In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Terminal Naming section, enter the Branch Identification string. Click Save to save your changes. Apply the highstate.

Expression language 3. Writing Salt Formulas 4. Separate Data 5. Generated Pillar Data You can also write your own custom formulas, and make them available to your clients in the Uyuni Web UI. This section contains information about writing custom formulas, including formulas with forms. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directoy also contains an optional metadata.yml file that contains additional information about a formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt// Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata// All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata//form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a : null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py The process is executed like this: The suma_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (suma_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Batching 2. Disabling the Salt Mine Salt is able to run commands in parallel on a large number of clients. This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C.","title":"Salt Rate Limiting","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-rate-limiting","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-rate-limiting.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Repository Access with a Proxy 11. Proxy Setup Salt SSH allows Salt commands and states to be issued directly over SSH. SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://suma-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the suma-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost suma-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to suma-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:suma-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to suma-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file= minion state.apply certs,` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time.","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see Custom System Information. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. If you change pillar data on the server (Salt master) the actual pillar data on the client (minion) is updated only after calling saltutil.refresh_pillar for the client. Otherwise it could happen that pillar.items and pillar.get calls would produce different results with different values of pillars that were not refreshed. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are sometimes referred to as Salt clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step.

Salt SSH Clients (SSH Push) Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (presence_ping_timeout/presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here. Uyuni defines a timeout for SSH connections in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: # salt_ssh_connect_timeout = 180","title":"Salt timeouts","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-timeouts","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-timeouts.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Install the Yomi Formula 2. Install the PXE Image 3. Register Yomi in Cobbler 4. Example Salt Pillar Preparation 5. Monitor the Installation Yomi (yet one more installer) is an installer for SUSE and openSUSE operating systems. Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp:///pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

If none is running yet, run eval $(ssh-agent). Add the SSH key to the running agent using ssh-add /path/to/the/private/key. The private key password will be prompted. Verify that SELinux is enabled on the new host by running getenforce. If the output is Enforcing, SELinux is enabled. In such case, we temporarily provide this Custom policy to allow the migration script to run. This file needs to be copied to /root/uyuni-selinux-policy.cil` on the new host. The migration script will load the policy into the new host and pass it as podman argument to run the migration script.

After creation: use registercloudguest to register the instance with the SUSE-operated update infrastructure in the cloud framework, or use the command SUSEConnect to register the system with SUSE Customer Center using the entitlements you already have. Connect your system to your own running RMT or Uyuni infrastructure in the same way you connect systems in your data center. BYOS instances make it easier to manage extensions such as LTSS or kernel live-patching.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring your own subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pay as you go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in Public Cloud Requirements. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete setup in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about setting up, see Public Cloud Setup.","title":"Initial setup","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"setup","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/byos/setup.html","titles":[]},"577":{"id":577,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

I no longer require support; how can I end the Uyuni PAYG subscription? Last updated: October 2023 BYOS Bring-your-own-subscription Uyuni deployments are supported on the cloud, however, billing will not be via the cloud marketplace. Once the existing subscription term ends, you can purchase Uyuni PAYG via the cloud provider marketplace and manage your instances with a Uyuni deployment that is billed via the cloud. Yes, the listing works independently from your existing BYOS Uyuni subscriptions. Please remember that support processes may be different for deployments using your existing BYOS subscription and those billed via the cloud and note that there is currently no process for migrating deployments between BYOS and PAYG versions. When purchasing Uyuni via the AWS & Azure Marketplaces, the billing is as follows: Billing is monthly and handled via cloud marketplace. Managed instances are recorded hourly. The peak usage total is recorded for the month. There is a monthly usage charge for each instance in the count. SLES for SAP Applications PAYG/on-demand instances, when purchased via the cloud marketplace, include Lifecycle Management(LCM) entitlements for Uyuni. The Uyuni PAYG billing engine recognizes the embedded LCM entitlements and does not include them in the count. This means there are no additional charges to manage these with the Uyuni PAYG listing. However, if Uyuni Monitoring is required for these instances, additional charges will apply for this feature. If using the Uyuni PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace, billing will commence from the time of deployment and when applicable client instances are on-boarded to Uyuni. There is the Uyuni BYOS listing in the cloud marketplace that can be used, a trial subscription key can be obtained via the SUSE Website. This deployment cannot be directly converted to allow billing via cloud marketplaces. To benefit from monthly billing via the cloud marketplace, Uyuni needs to be redeployed using the version from the PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace. Billing is based on the number of managed instances. Below are 3 examples of how the node count is calculated, check the table below for the detail. Static usage Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management, for 1 month with no additional managed clients added in the month. Bursting Model Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management for 3 weeks in the month, bursting to 30 managed instances for 1 week. Transient model A temporary deployment of Uyuni with 20 managed instances, for 2 weeks (336 hours) The total is calculated by counting number of active nodes (checked hourly). There is a monthly charge for each managed node under management in the billing cycle. Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated. Table 1. Usage calculations for different scenarios Managed Instances Peak Usage Billed for Static Usage 10 10 10 Bursting Model 10 - 3 Weeks, 30 - 1 Week 30 30 Transient Cluster 20 - 2 Weeks 20 20 It is dependent on the deployment and the cloud provider, as every Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has its own commercial terms and offers. It may be possible to secure special commercial terms such as an annual subscription. For example, AWS can offer Uyuni PAYG via a Private Offer. Please contact SUSE for more information. There are such programs at the cloud providers: Azure MACC Program AWS Enterprise Discount Program Google CUD Yes, it can. Please contact your cloud provider sales team for more details. Once Uyuni PAYG has been deployed from the marketplace listing and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase to manage additional instances. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of instances Uyuni is managing. Just on-board additional instances to Uyuni as needed, this will be reflected in your cloud marketplace bill. By default, the Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is ongoing for as long as Uyuni is deployed and instances are registered. Currently, there is no volume discount available. If you no longer require support, there are 2 options: Unregister all systems from the Uyuni Server Terminate the Uyuni instance.","title":"Billing - General","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-billing-general","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-billing-general.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

What client Operating Systems are supported with Uyuni PAYG? Currently, it is not possible to migrate an existing instance to the PAYG version. Customers can simply deploy a new Uyuni PAYG instance from the cloud marketplace and re-onboard all instances using the standard process. Client configuration overview It is simple to open a support case with SUSE for Uyuni PAYG. Create a ‘supportconfig’ via Uyuni PAYG instance CLI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) at the following link: https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport Providing marketplace billing is active, a support case will be opened. The Uyuni PAYG product available in the cloud marketplace is the same product, with similar functionality that you would run on-premises or with a manual installation. The only exceptions being the ability to bill via the cloud marketplace and connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure for Uyuni product updates. It is also worth checking the list of supported client operating systems to ensure your needs are met. It is recommended that the Uyuni instance always remains active. Uyuni PAYG, when deployed via the cloud marketplace will automatically connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure, no separate Uyuni subscription key is required. Updates to the Uyuni instance can be applied from those channels using standard SUSE tooling (i.e. zypper). Yes, Uyuni Hub is recommended for customers with more than 10,000 managed clients. If the Uyuni Hub instance has no connected clients, there will be no charge for the Uyuni Hub software components. Billing will occur from the downstream Uyuni PAYG Server instance, where managed instances are connected. To manage BYOS instances, SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Yes, it is possible to manage instances, in the cloud, on premises or both. To enable management of SUSE workloads in an on-premises data center, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider's network. With a hybrid landscape, egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider. To reduce these costs, SUSE recommend the use of the containerized proxy. Please note: Whilst the SUSE Manger Proxy usage is included as part of the Uyuni PAYG subscription, an LCM+ subscription will be billed if the proxy is also a managed workload, so in other words it counted as a managed client. No, to benefit from cloud marketplace billing, the Uyuni PAYG instance must reside on the cloud. Any Uyuni instances on premises will require their own subscriptions. Please refer to the product documentation for a full list of supported clients.

Last updated: October 2023 No, all components needed to handle the billing are part of the Uyuni PAYG code base. The cloud marketplace listing for Uyuni PAYG will deploy a Uyuni instance, together with the embedded billing engine. The cloud marketplace listing for Uyuni PAYG is tied to a specific version of Uyuni (4.3.8 at launch). Future listings will typically include the latest version available at the time of product/image creation. Please check the listing for further information. No, there is no choice over the Uyuni version when deploying using the cloud marketplace listing. If a prior version of Uyuni is required, this will need to be installed manually using the standard documentation and BYOS billing. The Marketplace listing is tied to a specific version of Uyuni, which is the latest version available at the time of the listing. Typically, the listing in the cloud marketplace is updated quarterly, or more frequently if there are security issues. It is worth noting that the image update process may not be fully aligned to the Uyuni product maintenance releases (every 6-8 weeks), so Uyuni PAYG instances should be patched regularly after deployment. Yes, the billing mechanism for the products is independent. Each deployment will be billed separately via the cloud marketplace. Existing deployments cannot be directly converted or updated to provide billing via the cloud marketplace.

Customers still have the option of using Uyuni byos (Bring-your-own-subscription), for which subscriptions and billing is handled directly by SUSE. The listings can be found in the AWS & Azure Marketplaces, there are two listings: On the AWS Marketplace, you will find the following: Uyuni Server Family (Non-EU and non-UK only) Uyuni Server Family (EU and UK only) On the Azure Marketplace, you will find: Uyuni with 24x7 Support Uyuni with 24x7 Support (EMEA Orders Only) For the purposes of this FAQ, we will refer to these listings as Uyuni PAYG. We have 2 listings for Uyuni, \"EU and UK only / EMEA Orders Only\" and \"non-EU and non-UK only\", you should pick the listing that reflects in which country your AWS & Azure account gets billed. The Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is not available to purchase in all countries. In case it is not available in your country you can still use the BYOS option. Your billing country is based on the AWS & Azure Account ID used to do the deployment. You can find out more about confirming your tax location as follows: For Amazon Web Services, it depends on the tax address of the account, see Tax help based on location For Microsoft Azure, it depends on the sold to address of the account, see Azure account profile Please see the link at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact Uyuni PAYG via the cloud marketplaces. If your cloud provider account is billed to one of the allowed countries, it is possible to deploy Uyuni in any region. It is not possible to transact/bill Uyuni PAYG via AWS & Azure Marketplaces in China. It is possible to deploy into regions in China. This means you can deploy Uyuni in a region in China if your billing is performed in a country that has the PAYG option available. Please see the addendum at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact Uyuni PAYG via the cloud. Yes, for customers that wish to use an existing annual Uyuni subscription, the BYOS Uyuni listing is available.

You can pre-create the role on your AWS account and then select it from the existing IAM role dropdown during the instance configuration process. If you create the role during the creation of an instance, the role will not be attached automatically. The role should be added post setup. A role can be assigned to a running instance through the following steps: Actions Security Modify IAM-role. For detailed information on IAM roles, see: docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM Procedure: Configuring your Uyuni instance Select the AMI image and provide a meaningful name for your server. Review the details and pricing information provided. You have the option to configure additional instance details in subsequent steps, such as storage, tags, security groups, and the required IAM role. The image automatically suggests a default CPU configuration. Choose an existing key pair or create a new one to grant access to the instance. Your organization should provide the necessary security groups and network configuration. If an IAM role has been previously created, you can attach it by selecting it from the Existing IAM role dropdown. Otherwise, attach this role after the instance has been launched.

Switch to the root user and update the system. sudo -i zypper refresh zypper update Before initiating yast2 susemanager_setup, ensure the network is correctly configured for Microsoft Azure. For Uyuni PAYG setup it is required, that a new Virtual Network and a new subnet is configured. It is impossible to setup the instance in an existing network. When you setup new clients which should be managed, take care that you put them into the private subnet which is configured with Uyuni PAYG. If you want to manage systems in an already existing network, you must configure peering. Procedure: Network Configuration Ensure the network configuration aligns such that hostname -f yields the identical name as the reverse DNS lookup of the private IP address. For instance, when executing nslookup 10.0.0.X. Insert the private IP with its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into /etc/hosts. For example: 10.0.0.4 instancename.internal.cloudapp.net Edit /etc/sysconfig/network/config and append internal.cloudapp.net to NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST. Execute netconfig update. Subsequently, hostname -f should return the same FQDN as obtained from nslookup 10.0.0.X. When adding new virtual machines (VMs), such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5, it’s crucial to ensure that they are configured within the same subnet as the SUSE Manager instance. This step is essential for successful network setup and integration. Additionally, be mindful of the geographical restrictions associated with your plans.
