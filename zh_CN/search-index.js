© 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

It enables you to manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up-to-date, with automated software management, asset management, and system provisioning. It also allows you to maintain a high level of security while effectively managing system life-cycle requirements. Uyuni uses Salt to provide event-driven configuration and management control. The Salt-master orchestrates tens of thousands of Salt clients (Uyuni clients) using remote execution. Uyuni offers seamless management of SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, Amazon Linux, AlmaLinux, and Raspberry Pi OS client systems. They can be on-premise, or on public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud or even multi-cloud environments. 为 Uyuni 版本 2024.07 提供了以下文档。 查看 HTML 查看 PDF 查看 HTML 查看 PDF 快速入门 零售指南 安装/升级指南 参考指南 客户端配置指南 常用工作流程 管理指南 专业化指南 Download all PDFs","title":"Uyuni 文档","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"index","url":"/uyuni/index.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 什么是 Uyuni？","hash":"_什么是_uyuni","id":1},{"text":"2. 可用文档","hash":"_可用文档","id":2}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 重复性操作 2. 操作链 3. 远程命令 You can manage actions on your clients in a number of different ways: You can schedule automated recurring actions to apply the highstate or an arbitrary set of custom states to clients on a specified schedule. You can apply recurring actions to individual clients, to all clients in a system group, or to an entire organization. You can set actions to be performed in a particular order by creating action chains. Action chains can be created and edited ahead of time, and scheduled to run at a time that suits you. You can also perform remote commands on one or more of your Salt clients. Remote commands allows you to issue commands to individual Salt clients, or to all clients that match a search term. 可以对单个 Salt 客户端、系统组、组织中的所有客户端应用重复性操作。 Uyuni 目前支持将以下操作类型作为重复性操作： Highstate：执行 Highstate。 自定义状态：执行一组自定义状态。自定义状态可以是 Uyuni 提供的内部状态，也可以是用户创建的配置通道。 有关配置通道的详细信息，请参见 配置管理。 过程：创建新的重复性操作 要将重复性操作应用于单个客户端，请导航到系统，单击要为其配置日程安排的客户端，然后导航到重复性操作选项卡。 要将重复性操作应用于系统组，请导航到系统 系统组，选择要为其配置日程安排的组，然后导航到重复性操作选项卡。 单击 创建。 从操作类型下拉列表中选择操作类型。 键入新日程安排的名称。 选择重复性操作的频率： 每小时：键入每小时内过去的分钟数。 例如，如果指定 15，则在每小时过去 15 分钟后运行操作。 每日：选择每日的时间。 例如，如果指定 01:00，则在 Uyuni Server 所在时区的每日 01:00 运行操作。 每周：选择星期日期和该日期中的时间，以便在每周的指定时间执行操作。 每月：选择月份日期和该日期中的时间，以便在每月的指定时间执行操作。 自定义 Quartz 格式：要查看更详细的选项，请输入自定义 Quartz 字符串。 例如，要在每个月的每个星期六 02:15 运行重复性操作，请输入： 0 15 2 ? * 7 可选：将测试模式开关切换为打开，以在测试模式下运行日程安排。 对于自定义状态类型的操作，请从可用状态列表中选择状态，然后单击 保存更改。此操作只会保存当前选择的状态，而不会保存日程安排。 在下一个窗格中，拖放所选状态使其按执行顺序排列，然后单击 确认。 单击 创建日程安排 保存设置，并查看现有日程安排的完整列表。 组织管理员可为组织中的所有客户端设置和编辑重复性操作。导航到首页 我的组织 重复性操作，即可看到适用于整个组织的所有重复性操作。 Uyuni 管理员可为所有组织中的所有客户端设置和编辑重复性操作。导航到管理 组织，选择要管理的组织，然后导航到状态 重复性操作选项卡。 如果您需要对客户端执行多个有序操作，可以创建一个操作链以确保遵循该顺序。 默认情况下，大多数客户端会在发出命令后立即执行操作。在某些情况下，操作需要很长时间，这可能意味着之后发出的操作会失败。例如，如果您指示客户端重引导，然后发出第二个命令，则第二个操作可能会失败，因为重引导仍在进行。为确保操作按正确的顺序进行，请使用操作链。 对于事务更新系统，操作链会在单个快照内执行，直到进行重引导操作。这可能会产生某些限制。 For more information, see 注册 SLE Micro 客户端 and Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients. You can use action chains on all clients. Action chains can include any number of these actions, in any order: 系统细节 远程命令 系统细节 安排系统重引导 系统细节 状态 Highstate 系统细节 软件 软件包 列出/去除 系统细节 软件 软件包 安装 系统细节 软件 软件包 升级 系统细节 软件 补丁 系统细节 软件 软件通道 系统细节 配置 映像 构建 过程：创建新操作链 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到您要在操作链中执行的第一个操作。例如，导航到客户端的系统细节，然后单击 安排系统重引导。 选中添加到字段，然后选择要将操作添加到的操作链： 如果这是您的第一个操作链，请选择新建操作链。 如果该操作链已存在，请从列表中选择它。 如果您已有操作链，但想要创建一个新操作链，请键入新操作链的名称以创建该操作链。 确认操作。 该操作不会立即执行，而是创建新的操作链，并在屏幕顶部显示一个确认此行为的蓝色条。 继续将操作添加到操作链，方法是选中添加到字段并选择要将操作添加到的操作链的名称。 添加完操作后，导航到日程安排 操作链并从列表中选择操作链。 通过将操作拖放到正确的位置来重新排列操作顺序。 单击蓝色加号查看要对其执行操作的客户端。单击 保存 以保存更改。 安排操作链的运行时间，然后单击 保存并安排。 如果您在不单击 保存 或 保存并安排 的情况下离开页面，将丢弃所有未保存的更改。 如果操作链中的某个操作失败，操作链将会停止，且不再执行其他操作。 可以通过导航到日程安排 待执行的操作来查看操作链中已安排的操作。 可以将客户端配置为远程运行命令。这样，在无法直接访问客户端的情况下，也可以向客户端发出脚本或单个命令。 This feature is automatically enabled on Salt clients, and you do not need to perform any further configuration. You can use this procedure to enable it manually, instead. 在开始之前，请确保您的客户端已订阅适用于其中所安装操作系统的工具子通道。有关订阅软件通道的详细信息，请参见 软件通道。 For transactional update systems, consider that a remote command is run inside a single snapshot. This can cause some limitations. For more information, see 注册 SLE Micro 客户端 and Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients. Remote commands are run from the /tmp/ directory on the client. To ensure that remote commands work accurately, do not mount /tmp with the noexec option. For more information, see Troubleshooting Mounting /tmp with noexec. 从远程命令页面运行的所有命令将在客户端上以 root 身份执行。可以使用通配符在任意数量的系统上运行命令。请务必在仔细检查后再发出命令。 过程：在 Salt 客户端上运行远程命令 导航到 Salt 远程命令。 在第一个字段中的 @ 符号之前，键入您要发出的命令。 在第二个字段中的 @ 符号之后，键入您要在其上发出命令的客户端。 可以键入单个客户端的受控端 ID，也可以使用通配符指定一系列客户端作为目标。 单击 查找目标 查看指定为目标的客户端，并确认使用了正确的细节。 单击 运行命令 向目标客户端发出命令。","title":"操作","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"actions","url":"/uyuni/administration/actions.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 重复性操作","hash":"recurring_actions","id":1},{"text":"2. 操作链","hash":"_操作链","id":2},{"text":"3. 远程命令","hash":"_远程命令","id":3}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"更新日期：2024-07-03 本指南提供有关在 Uyuni Server 上执行管理任务的指导。","title":"管理指南概述","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"admin-overview","url":"/uyuni/administration/admin-overview.html","titles":[]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 安装 SCAP 安全指南软件包 2.

The SAML:Attribute must be configured in the IdP and must be passed to Uyuni in the SAML authentication. The attribute must be named uid and must contain the Uyuni user mapped to it after login. The Uyuni must be created before you activate single sign-on. 需要以下端点： 声明使用者服务 (ACS)：接受 SAML 消息以建立与服务提供者的会话的端点。 Uyuni 中 ACS 的端点是：https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/acs 单点注销服务 (SLS)：从 IdP 发起注销请求的端点。 Uyuni 中 SLS 的端点是：https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/sls 元数据：用于检索 SAML 的 Uyuni 元数据的端点。 Uyuni 中元数据的端点是：https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/metadata 使用用户 orgadmin 成功通过 IdP 完成身份验证后，您将以 orgadmin 用户身份登录到 Uyuni，前提是 Uyuni 中存在 orgadmin 用户。 SSO 与其他类型的身份验证是互斥的：请要么启用，要么禁用 SSO。默认已禁用 SSO。 Use mgrctl term before running steps inside the server container. 过程：启用 SSO 如果您的用户在 Uyuni 中尚不存在，请先创建他们。 编辑 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf，在文件末尾添加下面一行： java.sso = true 在 /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf 中找到您要自定义的参数。 将要自定义的参数插入 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf，并在这些参数的前面加上 java.sso. 作为前缀。例如，在 /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf 中找到： onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs 要自定义此参数，请在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中创建相应的选项并在选项名称前面加上java.sso. 作为前缀： java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs 要查找您需要更改的所有参数实例，请在文件中搜索占位符 YOUR-PRODUCT 和 YOUR-IDP-ENTITY。每个参数都附带了其作用的简要说明。 重启动 spacewalk 服务以应用更改： mgradm restart 访问 Uyuni URL 时，您将重定向到 SSO 的 IdP，需要在其中完成身份验证。身份验证成功后，您将重定向到 Uyuni Web UI，并以经过身份验证的用户身份登录。如果您在使用 SSO 登录时遇到问题，请查看 Uyuni 日志了解详细信息。","title":"使用单点登录 (SSO) 进行身份验证","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auth-methods-sso","url":"/uyuni/administration/auth-methods-sso.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 先决条件","hash":"_先决条件","id":1},{"text":"2. 启用 SSO","hash":"_启用_sso","id":2}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"Uyuni 支持多种不同的身份验证方法。本章介绍可插入身份验证模块 (PAM) 和单点登录 (SSO)。","title":"身份验证方法","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auth-methods","url":"/uyuni/administration/auth-methods.html","titles":[]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 备份 Uyuni 2. 使用 smdba 管理数据库 3. 使用 smdba 备份数据库 3.1. 执行手动数据库备份 3.2. 安排自动备份 4. 从备份中还原 5. 存档日志设置 6. 检索有关占用的数据库空间的概览 7. 移动数据库 8. 根分区崩溃后进行恢复 9. 数据库连接信息 定期备份您的 Uyuni 安装以防数据丢失。由于 Uyuni 依赖于某个数据库以及已安装的程序和配置，因此备份所有安装组件非常重要。本章包含有关需要备份的文件的信息，并介绍如何使用 smdba 工具来管理数据库备份。其中还包含有关在发生系统故障时如何从备份中还原的信息。 无论您使用哪种备份方法，可用空间必须是当前安装使用的空间量的至少三倍。空间不足可能导致备份失败，因此请经常检查可用空间。 备份 Uyuni 安装的最完整方法是备份相关文件和目录。这可以节省备份管理时间，并且在发生故障时可以更快地重新安装和重新同步。但是，这种方法需要大量磁盘空间，并且可能需要很长时间才能完成备份。 如果您只想备份所需的文件和目录，请使用以下列表。为使此过程更简单、更完整，我们建议备份整个 /etc 和 /root 目录，而不仅仅是此处指定的目录。某些文件仅在您实际使用相关 SUSE Manager 功能时才存在。 /etc/cobbler/ /etc/dhcp.conf /etc/fstab 和所需的任何 ISO 挂载点。 如果您的 UUID 已更改，请确保已相应地更新 fstab 项。 /etc/rhn/ /etc/salt /etc/sudoers /etc/sysconfig/rhn/ /root/.gnupg/ /root/.ssh 如果您使用 SSH 隧道或 SSH push，则此文件存在。此外，必须已保存 id-susemanager 键的副本。 /root/ssl-build/ /srv/formula_metadata /srv/pillar /srv/salt /srv/susemanager /srv/tftpboot/ /srv/www/cobbler /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ /srv/www/os-images /var/cache/rhn /var/cache/salt /var/lib/cobbler/ /var/lib/cobbler/templates/（在 4.0 版之前为 /var/lib/rhn/kickstarts/） /var/lib/Kiwi /var/lib/rhn/ /var/run/pgsql/ /var/lib/salt/ /var/run/salt/ /var/spacewalk/ 包含自定义数据（例如脚本、Kickstart 或 AutoYaST 配置文件和自定义 RPM）的任何目录。 还需要备份您的数据库，此操作可以使用 smdba 工具来完成。 过程：从手动备份中还原 Re-deploy the Uyuni Server with mgradm install podman. 使用 Uyuni Web UI 或在命令提示符下使用 mgr-sync 工具重新同步您的 Uyuni 储存库。您可以选择重新注册产品，或跳过注册和 SSL 证书生成部分。 Re-install the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/ssl-build/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-MACHINE_NAME-VER-REL.noarch.rpm package. 安排在下次启动 rhn-search 服务时重新创建搜索索引。此命令仅生成调试消息，而不生成错误消息： rhn-search cleanindex Check whether you need to restore /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/. If /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/ was not in your backup, you need to restore it. If the source repository is available, you can restore `/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/ with a complete channel synchronization: mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels smdba 工具用于管理本地 PostgreSQL 数据库。使用此工具可以备份和还原数据库，以及管理备份。它还可用于检查数据库的状态，以及执行管理任务，例如重启动。有关 smdba 工具的详细信息，请参见 [reference:cli-smdba]。 smdba 工具仅适用于本地 PostgreSQL 数据库，而不适用于远程访问的数据库或 Oracle 数据库。 To access a shell inside the Server container, run mgrctl term on the container host. From there, one can run the CLI tools as usual. smdba 工具需要 sudo 访问权限，以便能够执行系统更改。在开始之前，请通过检查 /etc/sudoers 文件中的下面一行，来确保为 admin 用户启用了 sudo 访问权限： admin ALL=(postgres) /usr/bin/smdba 使用以下命令检查数据库的运行时状态： smdba db-status 此命令返回 online 或 offline，例如： Checking database core... online 可使用以下命令启动和停止数据库： smdba db-start 和 smdba db-stop smdba 工具执行连续存档备份。这种备份方法将合并当前会话期间对数据库所做和每项更改的日志，以及一系列较传统的备份文件。发生崩溃时，首先会从磁盘上和最近备份文件中还原数据库状态，然后精确重放当前会话的日志，使数据库恢复到当前状态。smdba 连续存档备份是在数据库正在运行的情况下执行的，因此无需停机。 这种备份方法非常稳定，通常会创建一致的快照，但可能会占用大量存储空间。请确保至少提供当前数据库大小三倍的可用空间用于备份。可以通过导航到 /var/lib/pgsql/ 并运行 df -h 来检查当前数据库大小。 smdba 工具还可以管理存档，仅保留最近的备份和当前日志存档。日志文件的最大文件为 16 MB，因此，当文件达到此大小时会创建一个新日志文件。每次创建新备份时，会清除以前的备份以释放磁盘空间。我们建议您使用 cron 来安排 smdba 备份以确保您的存储得到有效管理，并随时准备好一个备份，以防发生故障。 smdba 工具可直接从命令行运行。我们建议您在安装后立即运行手动数据库备份，或者在对配置进行任何重大更改后运行手动备份。 首次运行 smdba 或者更改了备份位置时，需要先重启动数据库，然后再执行存档。这会导致短暂的停机。定期数据库备份完全不需要停机。 过程：执行手动数据库备份 为备份分配永久存储空间。此示例使用 /var/spacewalk/ 中的目录。此目录将成为备份的永久目标，因此请确保您的服务器始终可以访问此目录。 在您的备份位置为备份创建一个目录： 以 root 身份运行以下命令： install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup 确保您对备份位置拥有适当的权限： chown postgres:postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup 首次创建备份时，请运行 smdba backup-hot 命令并设置 enable 选项。这会在指定的目录中创建备份，并根据需要重启动数据库： smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup 此命令将生成调试消息，成功完成时会返回以下输出： INFO: Finished 检查 /var/spacewalk/db-backup 目录中是否存在备份文件，确保备份成功。 无需关闭系统即可使用 smdba 执行数据库备份。但是，由于备份是一项大规模操作，因此在运行备份时，数据库性能可能会下降。我们建议您将定期数据库备份安排在低流量时段，以尽量减少中断。 请确保至少提供当前数据库大小三倍的可用空间用于备份。可以通过导航到 /var/lib/pgsql/ 并运行 df -h 来检查当前数据库大小。 过程：安排自动备份 为备份创建一个目录并设置适当的权限（以 root 身份）： install -d -m 700 -o postgres -g postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup 打开 /etc/cron.d/db-backup-mgr（如果该文件不存在，请创建），并在其中添加下面一行内容以创建 cron 作业： 0 2 * * * root /usr/bin/smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup 定期检查备份目录以确保备份按预期进行。 发生故障时，可以使用 smdba 工具从备份中还原。 过程：从备份中还原 关闭数据库： smdba db-stop 启动还原过程并等待它完成： smdba backup-restore start 重启动数据库： smdba db-start 检查 RPM 和数据库之间是否有差异。 spacewalk-data-fsck 数据库管理工具 smdba 可以通过存档日志记录来执行热备份。在包含嵌入式数据库的 Uyuni 中，默认已启用存档日志记录。 PostgreSQL 维护有限数量的存档日志。在使用默认配置的情况下，大约可以存储 64 个大小为 16 MiB 的文件。 创建用户并同步通道： SLES12-SP2-Pool-x86_64 SLES12-SP2-Updates-x86_64 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool-x86_64-SP2 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates-x86_64-SP2 PostgreSQL 会额外生成大约 1 GB 数据。因此，请务必考虑备份策略并定期创建备份。 存档日志存储在 /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog/ (postgresql) 中。 数据库管理员可以使用子命令 space-overview 来获取有关占用的表空间的报告，例如： smdba space-overview 输出： SUSE Manager Database Control. Version 1.5.2 Copyright (c) 2012 by SUSE Linux Products GmbH Tablespace | Size (Mb) | Avail (Mb) | Use % ------------+-----------+------------+------ postgres | 7 | 49168 | 0.013 susemanager | 776 | 48399 | 1.602 smdba 命令适用于 PostgreSQL。如需更详细的报告，请使用 space-tables 子命令。它可以列出表及其大小，例如： smdba space-tables 输出： SUSE Manager Database Control. Version 1.5.2 Copyright (c) 2012 by SUSE Linux Products GmbH Table | Size --------------------------------------+----------- public.all_primary_keys | 0 bytes public.all_tab_columns | 0 bytes public.allserverkeywordsincereboot | 0 bytes public.dblink_pkey_results | 0 bytes public.dual | 8192 bytes public.evr_t | 0 bytes public.log | 32 kB ... 可以将数据库移到另一个位置。例如，在数据库存储空间不足的情况下。 过程：移动数据库 Uyuni 的默认存储位置是 /var/lib/pgsql/。如果您想要移动此位置，例如移到 /storage/postgres/，请执行以下操作。 在命令提示符下，以 root 身份停止正在运行的数据库： rcpostgresql stop 关闭正在运行的 spacewalk 服务： spacewalk-service stop 结合 -a、--archive 选项使用 cp 复制当前工作目录结构。 例如： cp --archive /var/lib/pgsql/ /storage/postgres/ 此命令将 /var/lib/pgsql/ 的内容复制到 /storage/postgres/pgsql/。 /var/lib/pgsql 目录的内容需保持不变，否则 Uyuni 数据库可能会出现异常。您还应该确保有足够的可用磁盘空间。 挂载新的数据库目录： mount /storage/postgres/pgsql 切换到新目录并运行以下命令，确保所有权是 postgres:postgres 而不是 root:root： cd /storage/postgres/pgsql/ ls -l 输出： total 8 drwxr-x--- 4 postgres postgres 47 Jun 2 14:35 ./ 通过编辑 etc/fstab 将新数据库挂载位置添加到服务器的 fstab。 使用以下命令启动数据库： rcpostgresql start 启动 spacewalk 服务： spacewalk-service start 如果您的根分区已崩溃，您可以通过一些额外的步骤重启动 Uyuni Server。本节假设您已为数据库和通道使用不同的分区设置了服务器，这两个分区分别挂载在 /var/lib/pgsql 和 /var/spacewalk/ 位置。 安装新系统后，大多数用户和组将获得不同的 ID。大多数备份系统会存储名称而不是 ID，并将还原具有正确所有权和权限的文件。但是，如果您挂载现有分区，则必须使所有权与新系统保持一致。 过程：根分区崩溃后进行恢复 安装 Uyuni。不要挂载 /var/spacewalk 和 /var/lib/pgsql 分区。等待安装完成，然后继续下一步。 关闭数据库： rcpostgresql stop 关闭服务： spacewalk-service stop 挂载 /var/spacewalk 和 /var/lib/pgsql 分区。 还原备份 Uyuni中列出的目录。 启动数据库： rcpostgresql start 启动 spacewalk 服务： spacewalk-service start Uyuni 现在应该可以正常运行，而不会丢失数据库或已同步的通道。 可以通过在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中添加或编辑以下变量来设置 Uyuni 数据库连接信息： db_backend = postgresql db_user = susemanager db_password = susemanager db_name = susemanager db_host = localhost db_port = 5432 db_ssl_enabled =","title":"备份和还原","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"backup-restore","url":"/uyuni/administration/backup-restore.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 备份 Uyuni","hash":"backup-restore-product","id":1},{"text":"2. 使用 smdba 管理数据库","hash":"backup.smdba.admin","id":2},{"text":"3. 使用 smdba 备份数据库","hash":"backup.smdba.backup","id":3},{"text":"3.1. 执行手动数据库备份","hash":"_执行手动数据库备份","id":4},{"text":"3.2. 安排自动备份","hash":"smdba.automatic.backup.with.cron","id":5},{"text":"4. 从备份中还原","hash":"backup.smdba.restore","id":6},{"text":"5. 存档日志设置","hash":"config-smdb.archivelog","id":7},{"text":"6. 检索有关占用的数据库空间的概览","hash":"config-smdb.spaces","id":8},{"text":"7. 移动数据库","hash":"_移动数据库","id":9},{"text":"8. 根分区崩溃后进行恢复","hash":"config-smdb.recover-root","id":10},{"text":"9. 数据库连接信息","hash":"_数据库连接信息","id":11}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 通道管理 2. 删除通道 通道是将软件包分组的一种方法。 在 Uyuni 中，通道分为基础通道和子通道，基础通道按操作系统类型、版本和体系结构分组，子通道与其相关的基础通道兼容。将客户端指派到基础通道后，该系统只能安装相关的子通道。以这种方式组织通道可确保在每个系统上仅安装兼容的软件包。 软件通道使用储存库来提供软件包。通道镜像 Uyuni 中的储存库，软件包名称和其他数据存储在 Uyuni 数据库中。您可以使用与某个通道关联的任意数量的储存库。然后可以通过让客户端订阅相应的通道，将这些储存库中的软件安装在客户端上。 客户端只能指派到一个基础通道。然后，客户端可以安装或更新与该基础通道及其任何子通道关联的储存库中的软件包。 Uyuni 提供了许多供应商通道，这些通道为您提供了运行 Uyuni 所需的一切。Uyuni 管理员和通道管理员拥有通道管理权限，他们可以创建和管理自己的自定义通道。如果您想在环境中使用自己的软件包，可以创建自定义通道。自定义通道可以用作基础通道，或者您也可以将它们与供应商基础通道相关联。 有关创建自定义通道的详细信息，请参见 自定义通道。 默认情况下，任何用户都可以在系统中订阅通道。您可以使用 Web UI 对通道实施限制。 过程：限制订阅者对通道的访问权限 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到 软件 通道列表，并选择要编辑的通道。 找到每个用户的订阅限制部分并选中只有您组织中的选定用户可以订阅此通道。单击 更新 保存更改。 导航到订阅者选项卡，并根据需要选择或取消选择用户。 可以从命令提示符删除供应商软件通道。 过程：删除供应商通道 在 Uyuni Server 上的在命令提示符下，以 root 身份列出可用的供应商通道，并记下您要删除的通道： mgr-sync list channels 删除通道： spacewalk-remove-channel -c 有关删除自定义通道的信息，请参见 自定义通道。","title":"通道管理","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"channel-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/channel-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 通道管理","hash":"_通道管理","id":1},{"text":"2. 删除通道","hash":"delete_channels","id":2}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Related Topics Confidential Computing is a technology which allows protection of data in use by using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), the type of environments that provide increased level of security for data integrity, data confidentiality, and code integrity. The trustworthiness of the TEE is checked with the attestation process. Uyuni can be used as an attestation server for the systems registered to it. It generates a report page for the systems which run in this mode. These systems need to be attested and checked on regular base. The history of the past checks is also stored and available per request. Confidential Computing Attestation depends on the used hardware and environment where the attested systems are running on. Confidential Computing Attestation is only available on x86_64 architecture.

AppStream 过滤器 本节提供了一些常见示例来说明如何使用内容生命周期管理。请使用这些示例来构建您自己的个性化实现。 每月增补周期的示例项目包括： 创建一个按日期过滤器 将过滤器添加到项目 将过滤器应用于新项目构建 从项目中排除补丁 在项目中包含补丁 按日期过滤器排除指定日期之后发布的所有补丁。此过滤器对于遵循每月增补周期的内容生命周期项目很有用。 过程：创建按日期过滤器 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中键入过滤器的名称。 例如，按日期排除补丁。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（发布日期）。 在匹配器字段中，已自动选择晚于或等于。 选择日期和时间。 单击 保存。 过程：将过滤器添加到项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目并从列表中选择一个项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器 链接以查看所有可用的过滤器 选择新的按日期排除补丁过滤器。 单击 保存。 新过滤器已添加到过滤器列表，但仍然需要将其应用于项目。要应用过滤器，需要构建第一个环境。 过程：使用过滤器 单击 构建 以构建第一个环境。 可选：添加消息。 可以使用消息来帮助跟踪构建历史记录。 在测试服务器上使用新通道来检查过滤器是否正常工作。 单击 升级 将内容移到下一个环境。 如果您有大量过滤器，或者过滤器非常复杂，则构建过程需要较长时间。 测试可以帮助您发现问题。如果发现问题，请排除按日期过滤器之前发布的有问题补丁。 过程：排除补丁 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中输入过滤器的名称。 例如，排除 openjdk 补丁。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（建议名称）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 在建议名称字段中键入建议名称。 例如，SUSE-15-2019-1807。 单击 保存。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器 链接，选择排除 openjdk 补丁，然后单击 保存。 当您使用 构建 按钮重构建项目时，新过滤器将与前面添加的按日期过滤器一起使用。 此示例假设您收到了一条安全警报。当前工作月刚过几天，发布了一个重要的安全补丁。新补丁的名称是SUSE-15-2019-2071。您需要将此新补丁包含在您的环境中。 允许过滤器规则会覆盖拒绝过滤器规则的排除功能。有关详细信息，请参见 内容生命周期管理。 过程：在项目中包含补丁 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中键入过滤器的名称。 例如，包含内核安全修复。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（建议名称）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 在建议名称字段中键入 SUSE-15-2019-2071，然后选中允许。 单击 保存 以存储该过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并从列表中选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，然后选择包含内核安全补丁。 单击 保存。 单击 构建 以重构建环境。 每月增补周期完成后，您可以更新下个月的增补周期。 过程：更新每月增补周期 在按日期字段中，将过滤器的日期更改为下个月。 或者，创建一个新过滤器并更改项目的指派。 检查是否可以将 SUSE-15-2019-1807 的排除过滤器从项目中分离。 可能有一个新补丁可以修复此问题。 分离前面添加的允许过滤器。 默认已包含该补丁。 重构建项目以创建包含下个月补丁的新环境。 本节介绍如何设置过滤器以创建可在线增补的环境。 当您准备使用在线增补时，需要注意一些重要事项 永远只在您的系统上使用一个内核版本。 在线增补软件包与特定内核一起安装。 在线增补更新作为一个补丁交付。 后续会安装一系列新在线增补内核的每个内核补丁会显示需要重引导标志。 这些内核补丁附带在线增补工具。安装这些补丁后，需要在下一年开始之前至少重引导系统一次。 仅安装与已安装内核版本匹配的在线补丁更新。 在线补丁作为独立补丁提供。 您必须排除内核版本高于当前安装版本的所有常规内核补丁。 在此示例中，您将使用 SUSE-15-2019-1244 补丁更新您的系统。此补丁包含 kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64。 需要排除所有包含较高版本 kernel-default 的补丁。 过程：排除内核版本较高的软件包 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中键入过滤器的名称。 例如，排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（包含软件包）。 在匹配器字段中选择版本大于。 在软件包名称字段中键入 kernel-default。 将纪元字段留空。 在版本字段中键入 4.12.14。 在发行版字段中键入 150.17.1。 单击 保存 以存储该过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包，然后单击 保存。 单击 构建 后，会创建一个新环境。新环境包含版本不高于所安装版本的所有内核补丁。 所有内核版本更高的内核补丁都将被去除。只要在线增补内核不是发行系列中的第一个，它们就仍然可用。 可以使用过滤器模板自动完成此过程。有关如何应用在线增补过滤器模板的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templates。 特定内核版本的在线增补仅可使用一年。一年后，您必须更新系统上的内核。执行以下环境更改： 过程：切换到新内核版本 确定要升级到哪个内核版本。 例如：4.12.14-150.32.1 创建新的内核版本过滤器。 分离先前创建的过滤器排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包并挂接新过滤器。 单击 构建 以重构建环境。新环境包含版本不高于所选新内核版本的所有内核补丁。使用这些通道的系统具有可供安装的内核更新。您需要在系统执行升级后重引导系统。新内核的有效期为一年。在当年安装的所有软件包与当前在线增补内核过滤器匹配。 In a content lifecycle management project, you can use the AppStream filter to transform modular repositories into regular repositories. It does this by keeping the packages in the repository and stripping away the module metadata. The resulting repository can be used in Uyuni in the same way as a regular repository. AppStream repositories are natively supported throughout the Web UI. Therefore, this process is not mandatory to work with AppStream repositories. AppStream 过滤器将选择要包含在目标储存库中的单个模块流。您可以添加多个过滤器来选择多个模块流。 如果您不在 CLM 项目中使用 AppStream 过滤器，则模块化源中的模块元数据将保持不变，并且目标储存库包含相同的模块元数据。只要在 CLM 项目中至少启用一个 AppStream 过滤器，所有目标储存库就会转换为常规储存库。 在某些情况下，您可能想要构建常规储存库，而不包含任何模块的软件包。要实现此目的，请使用匹配器无（禁用模块化）添加 AppStream 过滤器。这会在目标储存库中禁用所有模块。此设置非常适合用于 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 客户端，这种客户端大多数模块的默认版本均已包含在作为常规储存库提供的 AppStream 储存库中。 To use the AppStream filter, you need a CLM project with a modular repository such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStreams. Ensure that you included the module you need as a source before you begin. 过程：使用 AppStream 过滤器 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 CLM project. 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 Click Create Filter and use these parameters: 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 在模块名称字段中键入模块名称。 例如 postgresql。 在流字段中键入所需流的名称。 例如 10。如果将此字段留空，则会选择模块的默认流。 单击 保存 以创建新过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，选择您的新 AppStream 过滤器，然后单击 保存。 可以使用创建/编辑过滤器表单中的浏览功能从模块化通道的可用模块流列表中选择一个模块。 过程：浏览可用模块流 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 CLM project. 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 单击浏览可用模块以查看所有模块化通道。 选择一个通道以浏览模块和流： 在模块名称字段中，开始键入要搜索的模块名称，或者从列表中选择。 在流字段中，开始键入要搜索的流名称，或者从列表中选择。 只能在浏览模块时选择通道。选定的通道不会与过滤器一起保存，并且不会对 CLM 过程产生任何影响。 您可以为要包含在目标储存库中的任何其他模块流创建额外的 AppStream 过滤器。会自动包含选定流所依赖的任何模块流。 请小心不要指定有冲突的、不兼容的或缺失的模块流。例如，从同一个模块中选择两个流是无效的。 过程：禁用模块化 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or 9 CLM project. 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择无（禁用模块化）。 单击 保存 以创建新过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，选择您的新 AppStream 过滤器，然后单击 保存。 这样会有效从目标储存库中去除模块元数据，并排除属于模块的所有软件包。 当您使用 Web UI 中的 构建 按钮构建 CLM 项目时，目标储存库是不包含任何模块的常规储存库，其中包含来自选定模块流的软件包。 在 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 项目中完全禁用模块化可能导致环境存在缺陷，因为在 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 中，某些模块对于系统的健康运行是不可或缺的。","title":"内容生命周期管理示例","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 为每月增补周期创建项目","hash":"create-proj-for-patch-cycle","id":1},{"text":"1.1. 创建一个按日期过滤器","hash":"create-a-filter","id":2},{"text":"1.2. 将过滤器添加到项目","hash":"add-filter-to-proj","id":3},{"text":"1.3.

AppStream Modules with Defaults 4. 构建内容生命周期项目 5. 升级环境 6. 将客户端指派到环境 内容生命周期管理允许您在更新生产客户端之前自定义和测试软件包。如果您需要在有限的维护时段内应用更新，此功能将特别有用。 内容生命周期管理允许您选择软件通道作为源、根据环境的需要调整软件通道，并在安装到生产客户端之前对其进行全面的测试。 虽然您无法直接修改供应商通道，但可以克隆它们，然后通过添加或去除软件包和自定义补丁来修改克隆版本。可以将这些克隆的通道指派到测试客户端，以确保它们按预期工作。 默认情况下，克隆的供应商通道与原始供应商通道一致并会自动选择依赖项。您可以在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中添加以下选项来禁止自动为克隆的通道选择依赖项： java.cloned_channel_auto_selection = false 然后，当所有测试都通过后，您可以将克隆的通道升级为生产服务器。 此功能是通过一系列环境实现的，软件通道在其生命周期内可以在这些环境之间转移。大多数环境生命周期至少包括测试和生产环境，但您可以创建任意所需数量的环境。 本章介绍基本的内容生命周期过程以及可用的过滤器。有关更具体的示例，请参见 内容生命周期管理示例。 要设置内容生命周期，需要从一个项目开始。该项目定义软件通道源、用于查找软件包的过滤器，以及构建环境。 过程：创建内容生命周期项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目并单击 创建项目。 在 标签字段中输入项目的标签。 标签字段仅接受小写字母、数字、句点、连字符和下划线。 在名称字段中输入项目的描述性名称。 单击 创建 按钮以创建项目并返回项目页面。 单击 挂接/分离源。 在源对话框中选择源类型，然后选择项目的基础通道。 此时会显示所选基础通道的可用子通道，包括有关通道是必需通道还是建议通道的信息。 选中所需的子通道，然后单击 保存 返回项目页面。 您选择的软件通道现在应会显示出来。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 在筛选器对话框中，选择要挂接到项目的过滤器。 要创建新过滤器，请单击 创建新过滤器。 单击 添加环境。 在环境生命周期对话框中，为第一个环境指定名称、标签和说明，然后单击 保存。 标签字段仅接受小写字母、数字、句点、连字符和下划线。 继续创建环境，直到为整个生命周期创建了所有环境。 可以选择环境在生命周期中的顺序，方法是在创建某个环境时在在前面插入字段中选择该环境。 Uyuni 允许您创建各种类型的过滤器来控制用于构建项目的内容。使用过滤器可以选择要在构建中包含或排除哪些软件包。例如，可以排除所有内核软件包，或仅包含某些软件包的特定发行版。 支持的过滤器为： 软件包过滤 按名称 按名称、纪元、版本、发行版和体系结构 按提供的名称 补丁过滤 按建议名称 按建议类型 按摘要 按关键字 按日期 按受影响的软件包 模块 按流 在内容过滤期间不会解析软件包依赖项。 可以将多个匹配器与过滤器配合使用。哪些匹配器可用取决于所选的过滤器类型。 可用的匹配器为： 包含 匹配（必须采用正则表达式形式） 等于 大于 大于或等于 低于或等于 低于 高于或等于 每个过滤器都有一个规则参数，可将此参数设置为允许或拒绝。过滤器的处理方式如下： 如果某个软件包或补丁满足拒绝过滤器的条件，则从结果中排除它。 如果某个软件包或补丁满足允许过滤器的条件，则将它包含在结果中（即使它已由拒绝过滤器排除）。 当您想要使用一般的拒绝过滤器来排除大量软件包或补丁，并想要使用特定的允许过滤器来“挑选”特定的软件包或补丁时，此行为很有用。 内容过滤器在您的组织中是全局性的，并可以在项目之间共享。 如果您的项目已包含构建的源，当您添加环境时，该环境中会自动填充现有内容。内容是从周期中的前一个环境（如果有）提取的。如果前一个环境不存在，则将内容留空，直到再次构建了项目源。 为了帮助为某些常见方案创建过滤器，Uyuni 提供了过滤器模板。应用这些模板有助于提前创建一组针对特定用例定制的过滤器。 本节介绍可用的模板及其用法。 在包含在线增补的项目中，必须排除未来的常规内核软件包，以便仅将在线补丁软件包作为更新提供给客户端。另一方面，仍然必须包含已安装的常规内核软件包以保持系统完整性。 应用此模板会创建三个所需的过滤器来实现以下行为： 允许其中包含与基础内核版本相同的 kernel-default 软件包的补丁 拒绝其中包含 reboot_suggested 关键字的补丁 拒绝其中包含带有名称 installhint(reboot-needed) 的软件包的补丁 有关如何设置在线增补项目的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version。 Procedure: Applying the Template 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择根据 SUSE 产品在线增补。 在产品字段中，选择要为其设置在线增补的产品。 在内核字段中，从所选产品的可用版本列表中选择一个内核版本。拒绝后续常规内核补丁的过滤器将基于此版本。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择具有指定前缀的三个过滤器，然后单击 保存。 如果您想要根据特定已注册系统中安装的内核版本设置在线增补项目，可以使用根据系统在线增补模板。 应用此模板会创建三个所需的过滤器来实现以下行为： 允许其中包含与基础内核版本相同的 kernel-default 软件包的补丁 拒绝其中包含 reboot_suggested 关键字的补丁 拒绝其中包含带有名称 installhint(reboot-needed) 的软件包的补丁 有关如何设置在线增补项目的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version。 Procedure: Applying the Template 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择根据特定系统在线增补。 在系统字段中，从列表中选择一个系统，或键入系统名称以缩小选项的范围。 在内核字段中，从所选系统上安装的版本列表中选择一个内核版本。拒绝后续常规内核补丁的过滤器将基于此版本。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择具有指定前缀的三个过滤器，然后单击 保存。 如果您想要在项目中包含模块化储存库中提供的所有可用模块，可以使用此过滤器模板自动添加这些模块。 应用后，此模板将为每个模块及其默认流创建一个 AppStream 过滤器。 如果从项目的页面完成此过程，则过滤器将自动添加到项目。否则，创建的过滤器可能会列在内容生命周期 过滤器中，并根据需要添加到任何项目。 可以编辑每个过滤器以选择不同的模块流，或去除所有这些过滤器以从目标储存库中排除该模块。 由于并非所有模块流都相互兼容，因此更改单个流可能会导致无法成功解析模块化依赖关系。如果发生这种情况，项目细节页面中的过滤器窗格会显示描述问题的错误，并且在选择的所有模块都兼容之前，构建按钮将会禁用。 自 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 起，模块便不再具有任何定义的默认流。因此，对 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 源使用此模板将不会有任何效果。 有关如何使用内容生命周期管理设置 AppStream 储存库的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters。 Procedure: Applying the Template 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您的项目。 在过滤器部分，单击 挂接/分离过滤器，然后单击 创建新过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择含默认值的 AppStream 模块。 在通道字段中，选择一个模块化通道以从中获取模块。此下拉列表中仅显示模块化通道。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 滚动到过滤器部分以查看新挂接的 AppStream 过滤器。 可以编辑/去除任何一个过滤器以根据您的需要定制项目。 创建项目、定义环境、挂接源和过滤器后，可以首次构建项目。 构建过程会将过滤器应用于挂接的源，并将过滤器克隆到项目中的第一个环境。 可以使用相同的供应商通道作为多个内容项目的源。在这种情况下，Uyuni 不会为每个克隆的通道创建新的补丁克隆版本，而是在所有克隆的通道之间共享一个补丁克隆版本。如果供应商修改了某个补丁（例如，撤回了该补丁，或者更改了补丁中的软件包），则这可能会导致问题。当您构建某个内容项目时，默认情况下，共享克隆补丁的所有通道将与原始通道同步，即使这些共享通道位于内容项目的其他环境中，或者位于您的组织的其他内容项目通道中，也是如此。可以通过在组织设置中关闭自动补丁同步来更改此行为。要在以后为共享补丁的所有通道手动同步补丁，请导航到软件 管理 通道，单击要同步的通道，然后导航到同步子选项卡。即使手动同步补丁，也会影响共享补丁的所有组织通道。 过程：构建内容生命周期项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您要构建的项目。 在构建项目前，请确保环境可用。 查看挂接的源和过滤器，然后单击 构建。 提供版本消息以描述此构建中的更改或更新。 可以在环境生命周期部分监视构建进度。 构建完成后，环境版本号将会加 1，可将构建的源（例如软件通道）指派到您的客户端。 构建项目后，可将构建的源按顺序升级到环境。 过程：升级环境 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您要处理的项目。 在环境生命周期部分，找到要升级到其后继版本的环境，然后单击 升级。 可以在环境生命周期部分监视构建进度。 当您构建和升级内容生命周期项目时，Uyuni 会创建一个软件通道树。要将客户端添加到环境，请使用客户端的系统细节页面中的软件 软件通道将基础通道和子软件通道指派到客户端。 新添加的克隆通道不会自动指派到客户端。如果您添加或升级了源，则需要手动检查并更新您的通道指派。 在将来的版本中，自动指派会添加到 Uyuni。","title":"内容生命周期管理","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For other repositories special preparation steps are needed (see below!). 当您创建新通道时，默认会选中启用 GPG 检查字段。如果您要将自定义软件包和应用程序添加到您的通道，请务必取消选中此字段，以便能够安装未签名的软件包。如果软件包来自不受信任的源，则禁用 GPG 检查会带来安全风险。 仅当储存库是有效的软件储存库时，才能使用 Web UI 将其添加到 Uyuni。请提前检查是否提供了所需的储存库元数据。可以使用 createrepo 和 reprepro 等工具进行这种检查。mgrpush 可帮助您将单个 RPM 推送到通道，而无需创建储存库。有关详细信息，请参见 createrepo_c 和 reprepro 的手册页。 过程：添加软件储存库 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 储存库，然后单击 创建储存库。 在创建储存库页面上，为该储存库指定标签（例如 my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo）。 在储存库 URL 字段中，提供包含 repodata 文件的目录的路径（例如 file:///opt/mytools/）。可以在此字段中使用任何有效寻址协议。 取消选中包含已签名的元数据？复选框。 可选：如果您的储存库需要客户端证书身份验证，请填写 SSL 字段。 单击 创建储存库。 The above procedure only works if the repository you want to mirror provides the \"key\" in the repository next to the signature. This is the case for all repositories generated by the OBS, but it is typically not the case for repositories of operating systems that are not offered by the OBS. If the repository you want to use does not have a GPG key you can provide one yourself and import the GPG key into the keyring manually. If you import the key into the /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir keyring using the gpg command line tool it would be stored permanently. The key would also persist if the chroot environment would be cleaned. 过程：使用 GPG 密钥创建软件储存库 The command to import a key into the keyring is: mgradm gpg add /path/to/gpg.key 使用 uyuni_suite、uyuni_component 和 uyuni_arch 查询参数添加 Debian 非平面储存库。 uyuni_suite 是必需的。在 Debian 文档中，此参数也名为 distribution。使用此参数可以指定 apt 源。如果不提供此参数，则会使用原始方法。如果该参数以 / 结尾，则会将储存库标识为平面储存库。 uyuni_component is optional. This parameter can specify only one component. It is not possible to list the components. An apt source entry allows to specify multiple components, but for Uyuni it is not possible. Instead you must create a separate repository for each component. uyuni_arch 是可选的。如果将其省略，则会使用 SQL 查询为数据库中的通道计算体系结构名称。如果uyuni_arch与通道体系结构不匹配（有时体系结构命名不明确），请显式指定此参数。 下面提供了一些示例： Table 1. Debian Non-flat Repository mapping 类型 源行/URL apt 源行 deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ URL 映射 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable?uyuni_suite=binary/ apt 源行 deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main URL 映射 https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists?uyuni_suite=stable&uyuni_component=main This following information about the Debian repository definition format is based on https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Overview. 储存库定义格式如下： deb URI 套件 [组件 1] [组件 2] [...] 例如： deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main 或 deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ 对于每一对套件和组件，规范定义了一个根据基 URL + 套件 + 组件计算的不同 URL。 过程：将储存库指派到通道 Assign your new repository to your custom channel by navigating to Software Manage Channels, clicking the name of your newly created custom channel. Navigate to the Repositories tab, and ensure the repository you want to assign to the channel is checked. Click Update Repositories. By default, the synchronization process starts immediately. For more information about channel synchronization, see Custom Channel Synchronization. 过程：将自定义通道添加到激活密钥 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 激活密钥，然后选择要将自定义通道添加到的密钥。 在细节选项卡上的子通道列表中，选择要关联的通道。 如果需要，您可以选择多个通道。 单击 更新激活密钥。 为了避免错过重要更新，SUSE 建议通过远程储存库更改来使您的自定义通道保持最新。 By default, a synchronization will happen automatically for all custom channels you create. In particular, it will happen: 在 UI 中或者使用 spacewalk-common-channels 将储存库添加到通道后 在执行日常任务 mgr-sync-refresh-default 的过程中，这将同步您的所有自定义通道和供应商通道。 要禁用此默认行为，请在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中设置： java.unify_custom_channel_management = 0 关闭此属性后，将不会自动执行同步，要使自定义通道保持最新，您需要： 通过导航到同步选项卡并单击 立即同步 来手动同步该通道。 在储存库选项卡中设置自动同步日程安排。 该过程开始后，可通过多种方式检查通道是否已完成同步： 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到管理 安装向导，然后选择产品选项卡。 产品同步时，此对话框将为每个产品显示一个完成栏。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与储存库关联的通道。 Navigate to the menu:[Repositories > Sync] tab. The Sync Status is shown next to the repository name. 在命令提示符下检查同步日志文件： tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log 每个子通道在同步过程中会生成自身的日志。您需要检查所有基础通道和子通道日志文件，以确保同步完成。 The following custom channel synchronization options are available: 保留已从储存库中去除的通道中的软件包 This turns off strict mode. 不同步勘误 Do not synchronize patches. 仅同步最新软件包 Synchronize latest package version only. 创建可无人值守安装树 This option prepares a directory tree ready for Kickstart auto installation. 出现任何错误时终止 Stop synchronizing if an error occurs. These options will be saved persistently for each channel. The Sync now button also saves the channel options before performing the synchronization. 如果您创建新的自定义通道但未从现有通道克隆，则创建的通道不包含任何软件包或补丁。可以使用 Uyuni Web UI 添加所需的软件包和补丁。 自定义通道只能包含克隆的或者自定义的软件包或补丁，并且这些软件包或补丁必须与通道的基础体系结构相匹配。添加到自定义通道的补丁必须适用于通道中的软件包。 过程：将软件包添加到自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到软件包选项卡。 可选：通过导航到列出/去除选项卡查看当前包含在通道中的所有软件包。 通过导航到添加选项卡将新软件包添加到通道。 选择要为其提供软件包的父通道，然后单击 查看软件包 以填充列表。 检查要添加到自定义通道的软件包，然后单击 添加软件包。 如果您觉得选择合适，请单击 确认添加 以将软件包添加到通道。 可选：可以通过导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到软件包 比较选项卡，将当前通道中的软件包与其他通道中的软件包进行比较。 要使两个通道相同，请单击 合并差异 按钮，然后解决任何冲突。 过程：将补丁添加到自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到补丁选项卡。 可选：通过导航到列出/去除选项卡查看当前包含在通道中的所有补丁。 通过导航到添加选项卡，然后选择要添加的补丁类型，将新补丁添加到通道。 选择要为其提供补丁的父通道，然后单击 浏览关联补丁 以填充列表。 检查要添加到自定义通道的补丁，然后单击 确认。 如果您觉得选择合适，请单击 确认 以将补丁添加到通道。 Uyuni 管理员和通道管理员可以更改或删除任何通道。 要授予其他用户更改或删除通道的权限，请导航到软件 管理 通道，然后选择要编辑的通道。导航到管理者选项卡，并选中要向其授予权限的用户。单击 更新 以保存更改。 如果您删除某个已指派到一组客户端的通道，与已删除通道关联的任何客户端的通道状态将立即更新。这是为了确保在储存库文件中准确反映所做的更改。 无法使用 Web UI 删除 Uyuni 通道。只能删除自定义通道。 过程：删除自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后选择要删除的通道。 单击 删除软件通道。 在删除通道页面上，检查您要删除的通道的细节，然后选中取消订阅系统复选框，以从任何可能仍已订阅的系统中去除该自定义通道。 单击 删除通道。 删除通道时，不会自动去除其中的软件包。您无法更新其通道已被删除的软件包。 可以在 Uyuni Web UI 中删除与通道没有关联的软件包。导航到软件 管理 软件包，选中要去除的软件包，然后单击 删除软件包。","title":"自定义通道","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"custom-channels","url":"/uyuni/administration/custom-channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 创建自定义通道和储存库","hash":"_创建自定义通道和储存库","id":1},{"text":"2.

List of Built Images Uyuni enables system administrators to build containers and OS Images and push the result in image stores. Procedure: Building and Pushing Images Define an image store. Define an image profile and associate it with a source (either a git repository or a directory). Build the image. Push the image to the image store. Uyuni supports two distinct build types: Dockerfile and the Kiwi image system. Kiwi 构建类型用于构建系统映像、虚拟映像和其他映像。Kiwi 构建类型的映像存储区预定义为文件系统目录，其路径为服务器上的 /srv/www/os-images。Uyuni 通过 HTTPS 从 ///os-images/ 提供映像存储区。映像存储区位置是唯一的，不可自定义。 映像存储在 /srv/www/os-image/ORGANIZATION-ID 中。 容器功能适用于运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 或更高版本的 Salt 客户端。在开始之前，请确保您的环境满足以下要求： 一个包含 Dockerfile 和配置脚本的已发布 git 储存库。该储存库可以是公用或专用的，应托管在 GitHub、GitLab 或 BitBucket 上。 一个正确配置的映像存储区，例如 Docker 注册表。 有关容器的详细信息，请参见 https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/html/Container-guide/。 要使用 Uyuni 构建映像，您需要创建并配置一个构建主机。容器构建主机是运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 或更高版本的 Salt 客户端。本节将指导您完成构建主机的初始配置。 构建主机上的操作系统必须与目标映像上的操作系统匹配。 例如，在运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15（SP2 或更高版本）操作系统版本的构建主机上构建基于 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 的映像。在运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 或 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 操作系统版本的构建主机上构建基于 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 的映像。 不支持跨体系结构构建。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，执行以下步骤以配置构建主机： Procedure: Building a Host 在系统 概览页面中选择要指定为构建主机的 Salt 客户端。 在所选客户端的系统细节页面中指派容器模块。转到软件 软件通道并启用容器模块（例如 SLE-Module-Containers15-Pool 和 SLE-Module-Containers15-Updates）。单击 更改订阅 以确认。 在系统细节 属性页面中，从附加系统类型列表中启用容器构建主机，然后单击 更新属性 以确认。 通过应用 Highstate 安装所有必需的软件包。在系统细节页面中选择状态 Highstate，然后单击应用 Highstate。或者，从 Uyuni Server 命令行应用 Highstate： salt '$your_client' state.highstate 使用 Uyuni 构建的容器使用在构建映像时作为储存库关联到激活密钥的通道。本节将指导您为此目的创建一个临时激活密钥。 要构建容器，需要一个与通道关联的激活密钥，但该通道不能是 SUSE Manager Default。 过程：创建激活密钥 选择系统 激活密钥。 单击 创建密钥。 输入说明和密钥名称。使用下拉菜单选择要与此密钥关联的基础通道。 单击 创建激活密钥 确认。 有关详细信息，请参见 激活密钥。 构建的所有映像将推送到映像存储区。本节包含有关创建映像存储区的信息。 Procedure: Creating Image Store 选择映像 存储区。 单击创建以创建新存储。 在标签字段中定义映像存储区的名称。 通过填写 URI 字段提供映像注册表的路径，该路径用作容器注册表主机（无论是内部还是外部）的完全限定域名 (FQDN)。 registry.example.com 注册表 URI 还可用于指定已被使用的注册表中的映像存储区。 registry.example.com:5000/myregistry/myproject 单击 创建 以添加新的映像存储区。 所有容器映像都是使用包含构建说明的映像配置文件构建的。本节包含有关使用 Uyuni Web UI 创建映像配置文件的信息。 过程：创建映像配置文件 要创建映像配置文件，请选择映像 配置文件，然后单击 创建。 通过填写标签字段提供映像配置文件的名称。 如果您的容器映像标记采用类似于 myproject/myimage 的格式，请确保您的映像存储区注册表 URI 包含 /myproject 后缀。 使用 Dockerfile 作为映像类型。 使用下拉菜单从目标映像存储区字段中选择您的注册表。 In the Path field, type a GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket repository URL. The URL should be http, https, or a token authentication URL. Use one of these formats: GitHub 路径选项 GitHub 单用户项目储存库 https://github.com/USER/project.git#branchname:folder GitHub 组织项目储存库 https://github.com/ORG/project.git#branchname:folder GitHub 令牌身份验证 如果您的 git 储存库是专用的，请修改配置文件的 URL 以包含身份验证。使用以下 URL 格式通过 GitHub 令牌进行身份验证： https://USER:@github.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab 单用户项目储存库 https://gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab 组项目储存库 https://gitlab.example.com/GROUP/project.git#master:/container/ GitLab 令牌身份验证 如果您的 git 储存库是专用的且不可公开访问，则需要修改配置文件的 git URL 以包含身份验证。使用以下 URL 格式通过 GitLab 令牌进行身份验证： https://gitlab-ci-token:@gitlab.example.com/USER/project.git#master:/container/ 如果您未指定 git 分支，则默认会使用 master 分支。如果未指定 folder，则映像源（Dockerfile 源）预期位于 GitHub 或 GitLab checkout 分支的根目录中。 选择一个激活密钥。激活密钥可确保将使用配置文件的映像指派到正确的通道和软件包。 将激活密钥与映像配置文件关联后，可以确保使用该配置文件的任何映像都会使用正确的软件通道以及该通道中的任何软件包。 单击 创建 按钮。 An Image Profile that can be reused is published at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles.

中的维护时段功能，可以将操作安排在预定的维护时段执行。如果您创建了维护时段日程安排并将其应用于客户端，则无法在指定的时段以外执行某些操作。 维护时段的工作方式不同于系统锁定。系统锁可按需打开或关闭，而维护时段则是定义允许执行操作的时间段。此外，允许和受限的操作也不相同。有关系统锁的详细信息，请参见 系统锁定。 维护时段需要日历和日程安排。日历定义维护时段事件（包括重复性事件）的日期和时间，并且必须采用 ical 格式。日程安排使用日历中定义的事件来创建维护时段。必须创建一个要上载的 ical 文件，或链接到 ical 文件以创建日历，然后才能创建日程安排。 创建日程安排后，可将其指派给已注册到 Uyuni Server 的客户端。指派有维护日程安排的客户端在维护时段以外无法运行受限操作。 受限操作会对客户端进行重大修改，可能导致客户端停止运行。受限操作的一些示例包括： 软件包安装 客户端升级 产品迁移 Highstate 应用（针对 Salt 客户端） 非受限制操作属于次要操作，一般认为它们是安全的，不太可能会在客户端上造成问题。非受限操作的一些示例包括： 软件包配置文件更新 硬件刷新 订阅软件通道 在开始之前，必须创建一个要上载的 ical 文件，或链接到 ical 文件以创建日历。可以在您偏好的日历工具（例如 Microsoft Outlook、Google Calendar 或 KOrganizer）中创建 ical 文件。 过程：上载新的维护日历 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到日程安排 维护时段 日历，然后单击 创建。 在日历名称部分，为日历键入一个名称。 提供 ical 文件的 URL，或直接上载该文件。 单击 创建日历 以保存您的日历。 过程：创建新的日程安排 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到日程安排 维护时段 日程安排，然后单击 创建。 在日程安排名称部分，为日程安排键入一个名称。 可选：如果您的 ical 文件包含要应用于多个日程安排的事件，请选中多个。 选择要指派到此日程安排的日历。 单击 创建日程安排 以保存您的日程安排。 过程：将日程安排指派到客户端 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，选择要将日程安排指派到的客户端，找到系统属性面板，然后单击 编辑这些属性。 或者，可以通过系统集管理器指派客户端，方法是导航到系统 系统集管理器并使用其他 维护时段选项卡。 在编辑系统细节页面中，找到维护日程安排字段，然后选择要指派的日程安排的名称。 单击 更新属性 以指派维护日程安排。 当您将新的维护日程安排指派到某个客户端时，可能已经为该客户端安排了一些受限操作，而这些操作现在可能与新的维护日程安排有冲突。如果发生这种情况，Web UI 会显示错误，并且您无法将该日程安排指派到该客户端。要解决此问题，请在指派日程安排时选中 取消受影响的操作 选项。这样就会取消以前安排的与新维护日程安排冲突的所有操作。 创建维护时段后，可以安排要在维护时段内执行的受限操作，例如软件包升级。 过程：安排软件包升级 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，选择要升级的客户端，然后转到软件 软件包 升级选项卡。 从列表中选择要升级的软件包，然后单击 升级软件包。 在维护时段字段中，选择由客户端用来执行升级的维护时段。 单击 确认 以安排软件包升级。 创建日历时，该日历会包含许多事件，这些事件可能是一次性事件，也可能是重复性事件。每个事件包含一个摘要字段。如果您要为一个日历创建多个维护日程安排，可以使用摘要字段为每个日程安排指定事件。 例如，您可能想要为生产服务器创建一个日程安排，并为测试服务器创建另一个日程安排。在这种情况下，可以针对生产服务器的事件指定摘要：生产服务器，并针对测试服务器的事件指定摘要：测试服务器。 日程安排分为两种类型：“单”或“多”。如果您的日历包含应用于多个日程安排的事件，则您必须选择多，并确保根据日历文件中使用的摘要字段为日程安排命名。 过程：创建多日程安排 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到日程安排 维护时段 日程安排，然后单击 创建。 在日程安排名称部分，键入日程安排的名称。 确保此名称与日历的摘要字段匹配。 选中多选项。 选择要指派到此日程安排的日历。 单击 创建日程安排 以保存您的日程安排。 要创建下一个日程安排，请单击 创建。 在日程安排名称部分，键入第二个日程安排的名称。 确保此名称与第二个日历的摘要字段匹配。 选中多选项。 单击 创建日程安排 以保存您的日程安排。 对需要创建的每个日程安排重复上述过程。 本节包含受限和非受限操作的完整列表。 受限操作会对客户端进行重大修改，可能导致客户端停止运行。受限操作只能在维护时段内运行。受限操作包括： 软件包操作（例如安装、更新或去除软件包） 补丁更新 重引导客户端 回滚事务 配置管理更改任务 应用 Highstate（针对 Salt 客户端） 自动安装和重新安装 远程命令 产品迁移 群集操作 对于 Salt 客户端，可以随时通过导航到 Salt 远程命令来直接运行远程命令。无论 Salt 客户端是否处于维护时段，都可以这样做。有关远程命令的详细信息，请参见 操作。 非受限制操作属于次要操作，一般认为它们是安全的，不太可能会在客户端上造成问题。如果某个操作不受限制，则它在定义上就是非受限操作，随时都可以运行。","title":"维护时段","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"maintenance-windows","url":"/uyuni/administration/maintenance-windows.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Check zypper --help to confirm whether removeptf is supported. The List/Remove tab is only visible if this condition is met. In case the PTF should be removed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageRemove API can be used with the proxy package name. In case a PTF should be removed directly on the client using the console, it is required to use a special command zypper removeptf.

Clean the Packages from the Filesystem This workflow shows how to manually remove SUSE provided channels from Uyuni and to clean up end-of-life products, to reclaim space or for other purposes. Manual channel removal consists of Preparing to Remove a Channel and Removing Channel. Before removing a channel, you must identify the label for the channel to be removed. It can be done with Web UI or on the command line. Be careful not to remove channels that systems are currently subscribed to, or that you are planning on subscribing a system to. If there are systems that are currently subscribed to a channel that you want to delete, do not remove the channel until those systems are upgraded or unsubscribed. Procedure: Identifying Channel Labels Using Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, in the sidebar navigate to Software Channel List All. This page displays the Channel Name. If you select the link for a channel name, you will see the field for Channel Label. Identify the channel, and child channels, to be removed. Procedure: Identifying Channel Labels Using the Command Line You can get a list of channels by running the following command: spacewalk-remove-channel -l Procedure: Verifying Channel System Subscriptions Using Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, in the sidebar navigate to Software Channel List All. Locate Systems column on the right. Check the Systems column for the channel, or any child channels, that you want to remove. Procedure: Verify Channel System Subscriptions Using the Command Line Run the following command: spacecmd -- softwarechannel_listsystems A channel, with its metadata, can be removed in the SUMA command line by using the spacewalk-remove-channel command. This command does not remove the packages themselves from the filesystem. Removing packages from the filesystem is described in [cleaning-up-channel-packages]. Procedure: Removing an Individual Channel Using the Command Line To remove an individual channel run the following command: spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label + . To remove multiple channels at the same time, use -c flag for each channel, followed by the channel-label. For example: + spacewalk-remove-channel -c channel-label1 -c channel-label2 Listing 1. Procedure: Removing a Parent and All Its Child Channels . It is also possible to remove a parent channel with all of its child channels, like this: spacewalk-remove-channel -a sles12-sp5-pool-x86_64 Listing 2. Procedure: Clean the Packages from the Filesystem . The following command checks for anything that is still showing in the filesystem, but not in the SUMA database and then removes it. # spacewalk-data-fsck -r -S -C -O + The final cleanup command can take several minutes, or even hours to complete.","title":"Removing Channel","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"removing-channels","url":"/uyuni/administration/removing-channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

身份验证能够正常进行，客户端必须信任根 CA。这意味着必须在每个客户端上安装根 CA。 默认的 SSL 身份验证方法是让 Uyuni 使用自我签名证书。在这种情况下，Uyuni 已生成所有证书，并且根 CA 已直接为服务器证书签名。 另一种方法是使用中间 CA。在这种情况下，根 CA 为中间 CA 签名。然后中间 CA 可为任意数量的其他中间 CA 签名，而最后一个中间 CA 为服务器证书签名。这称为链式证书。 如果您在链式证书中使用中间 CA，则根 CA 将安装在客户端上，而服务器证书则安装在服务器上。在 SSL 握手期间，客户端必须能够校验根 CA 与服务器证书之间的整个中间证书链，因此它们必须能够访问所有中间证书。 可以通过两种主要方式实现此目的。在较旧版本的 Uyuni 中，所有中间 CA 默认都安装在客户端上。但是，您也可以在服务器上配置服务以将其提供给客户端。在这种情况下，在 SSL 握手期间，服务器会提供服务器证书以及所有中间 CA。此机制现已用作新的默认配置。 Uyuni 默认使用没有中间 CA 的自我签名证书。为了提高安全性，您可以安排一个第三方 CA 来为您的证书签名。第三方 CA 执行检查以确保证书中包含的信息正确。他们通常针对此项服务收取年费。使用第三方 CA

Use Case 2. Outcome 3. Preparation 4. Step-by-step Workflow Instructions 5. Related Topics Uyuni is all about managing client systems. So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients. This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see Client Requirements. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see Registration Methods. Procedure: Configure a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on Your Client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.suma.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.suma.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare Software Channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Related Topics This workflow shows how to automate updating the clients registered at Uyuni using recurring actions. Automated update of clients is benefitial when: update of a large number of clients is wanted the workflow should not be re-done every execution a dedicated maintenance window exists. Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent and supportable state. Before you start, you should have a number of clients onboarded. It may make sense to have them sorted into groups you want to update together. In this workflow we use a system group named infra-services. To update a client two steps are required. A third step is optional but highly recommended to finalize the update process. Procedure 1: Creating a Recurring Action to Update Salt Itself As an example, we create the action to update Salt itself as a recurring action for all systems in the organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like update-salt. Select a schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:00 am . Assign the update-salt state by selecting the checkbox. Click Save Changes to save the action. You can edit the execution order of the states if needed. Click Confirm to confirm the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 2: Creating a Recurring Action to Apply All Available Updates to the Systems As an example we create the action to apply all updates as a recurring action for a system group called infra-services. In the Uyuni Web UI go to Systems System Groups and click on infra-services. Now go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like full-system-update. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:30 am . Keep enough time between this action and the update-salt action. The update-salt actions must be finished on all systems before this action should be executed. Assign the states util.syncall, certs, channels and uptodate by selecting the checkboxes. Save the action by clicking Save Changes. You can edit the execution order of the states. The order should be util.syncall, certs, channels, and finally uptodate. Click Confirm to store the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. The uptodate state also performs a reboot, if an update requests it. This reboot be prevented if needed. For example, the systems which use live patching need to prevent the rebooting following the update. Procedure 3: Configuring Systems to Not Reboot After the uptodate State is Applied In the Uyuni Web UI go to Systems Custom System Info and click Create Key. Enter mgr_reboot_if_needed as Key Label and set a Description. Click Create Key to store the new key. To assign values to multiple systems, navigate in the Uyuni Web UI to Systems Overview and select the checkbox for all systems you want to modify. These system are not in the System Set Manager (SSM). Select in the left menu System Set Manager and select Misc Custom Values in the tab bar. Click on the mgr_reboot_if_needed key label and enter False as Value. Click Set Values to save. Procedure 4: Creating a Recurring Action to Run a Highstate After the Update As an example, we create the action to apply the highstate for the same group which was fully updated before. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click infra-services. Go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Highstate and enter a Schedule Name like highstate. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 10:30 am . Again, keep enough time between this action and the full-system-update action. Click Create Schedule to save the action.

Related Topics You can use configuration files and channels to manage configuration for your clients, rather than configuring each client manually. This workflow shows you how to use the Uyuni Web UI to create a centrally managed configuration file, assign it to a client, and apply the configuration. If you are managing a lot of clients, you probably do not want to manually apply configuration settings to each of them in turn. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a configuration channel containing a configuration file, have assigned clients to the channel, and applied the configuration successfully. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. At least one client registered to your server. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a centrally managed configuration file and a Salt state. You can also use locally managed configuration files and different methods, to get more flexibility in how you manage configuration in your environment. For more information about the different ways to manage configuration, see 配置管理. Procedure: Create a New Configuration Channel and file In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels and click Create State Channel.

Use Case 2. Outcome 3. Preparations 4. Step-by-step Workflow Instructions 5. Related Topics If you are managing a lot of clients and you need to apply customized packages to them, you can use content lifecycle management (CLM) to manage your packages. CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, which you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. Procedure: Create a new CLM Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. Leave the Filters section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example. You can add filters later on if you need to. In the Environment Lifecycle section, create three environments: production, testing, and development. Click Add Environment and complete the name and label for each. For the production environment, leave the Insert before field blank. For the testing environment, in the Insert before field, select production. For the development environment, in the Insert before field, select testing``. Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign Clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel -production-. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel -testing-. Click Next to assign the client. Procedure: Promote Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section.

Migration of Clients This workflow shows how to automatically complete the task of in-place SUSE Linux Enterprise Server instances upgrade with Uyuni Server. In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center.

In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration. Procedure: Migrating Clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. + image::wf-inplaceMigration-06.png[scaledwidth=80%] + image::wf-inplaceMigration-07.png[scaledwidth=80%] Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console.","title":"In-place Upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Each activation key is bound to an organization, which you can set when you create the key. 在 Uyuni 中，激活密钥是一组带有标签的配置设置。您可以通过将某个激活密钥的标签作为参数添加到引导脚本，来应用与该激活密钥关联的所有配置设置。我们建议您结合引导脚本来使用激活密钥标签。当执行引导脚本时，与该标签关联的所有配置设置都将应用到运行脚本的系统上。 激活密钥可以指定以下各项： 通道指派 系统类型或附加权利 联系方法 配置文件 要安装的软件包 系统组 在注册客户端时需使用激活密钥，之后将不再使用。无论激活密钥指定了什么内容，注册好客户端后，就能以任何方式对其进行更改。记录激活密钥与客户端之间的关联仅为了历史记载。 过程：创建激活密钥 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，以管理员身份导航到系统 激活密钥。 单击 创建密钥 按钮。 在激活密钥细节页面的说明字段中，输入激活密钥的说明。 In the Key field, enter a name for the activation key. For example, SLES15-SP5 for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5. 对于任何 SUSE 产品，请不要在密钥字段中使用逗号或双引号。不过，对于 Red Hat 产品，则 必须 使用逗号。 所有其他字符均可使用，不过系统会自动去除 <> (){}（包括空格）。 如果将字段留空，系统会生成一个随机字符串。 In the Base Channels drop-down box, select the appropriate base software channel, and allow the relevant child channels to populate. For more information, see reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc#vle.webui.admin.wizard.products and 自定义通道. 选择所需的子通道（例如，必需的 SUSE Manager 工具和更新通道）。 如果需要启用任何选项，请选中附加系统类型复选框。 建议您保留默认设置的联系方法。 建议您将统一默认设置保留未选中状态。 单击 创建激活密钥 以创建激活密钥。 选中配置文件部署复选框以对此密钥启用配置管理，然后单击 更新激活密钥 保存此更改。 在您创建激活密钥前，配置文件部署复选框将不会显示。如果您需要启用配置管理，请务必返回并选中该复选框。 重新激活密钥可用来重新注册客户端并重新获得所有 Uyuni 设置，但只能使用一次。重新激活密钥为客户端特定密钥，包含系统 ID、历史记录、组和通道。 要创建重新激活密钥，请导航到系统，单击要为其创建重新激活密钥的客户端，然后导航到细节 重新激活选项卡。单击 生成新密钥 以创建重新激活密钥。记录密钥细节以供日后使用。与未与特定系统 ID 关联的典型激活密钥不同，此处创建的密钥不会显示在系统 激活密钥页面中。 After you have created a reactivation key, you can use it as the management_key grain in /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf. For example: grains: susemanager: management_key: \"re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e\" Restart the venv-salt-minion or salt-minion process to apply the reactivation key. 您可以结合引导脚本来使用重新激活密钥。有关引导脚本的详细信息，请参见 Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script。 如果您使用客户端现有的 Uyuni 配置文件自动安装客户端，该配置文件会使用重新激活密钥来重新注册系统并恢复其设置。请勿在正在进行基于配置文件的自动安装时重新生成、删除或使用此密钥， 否则会导致自动安装失败。 默认父通道 避免使用 SUSE Manager Default 父通道。此设置会强制 Uyuni 选择与所安装操作系统最匹配的父通道，而这有时可能会导致非预期的行为。请改为创建特定于每个发行套件和体系结构的激活密钥。 使用激活密钥引导 如果您要使用引导脚本，请考虑为每个脚本创建一个激活密钥。这有助于您调整通道指派、软件包安装、系统组成员资格和配置通道指派。注册后，您需要与系统手动交互的情形也会减少。 引导 LTSS 客户端 如果您要引导订阅了 LTSS 的客户端，请在创建激活密钥期间包含 LTSS 通道。 带宽要求 使用激活密钥可能导致在注册时自动下载软件，这对于存在带宽限制的环境来说可能并不适宜。 下列选择会产生带宽用量： 指派 SUSE Product Pool 通道会导致自动安装相应的产品描述符软件包。 安装软件包部分中的所有软件包。 配置部分中的任何 Salt 状态都可能会触发下载，具体视其内容而定。 密钥标签命名 如果您没有为激活密钥输入直观易懂的名称，系统会自动生成一串数字字符串，这会使得您的密钥难以管理。 请考虑为您的激活密钥使用一种命名模式，以方便您进行跟踪。设计与您组织的基础结构相关的名称有助于您更轻松地执行较复杂的操作。 在创建密钥标签时，请考虑以下提示： 操作系统命名（必需）：密钥应始终代表提供的设置所适用的操作系统 体系结构命名（建议）：除非您的公司仅在一个体系结构上运行（例如 x86_64），否则最好提供含体系结构类型的标签。 服务器类型命名：此服务器的用途是什么？ 位置命名：服务器位于何处？机房、建筑物或部门？ 日期命名：维护时段、季度等。 自定义命名：哪种命名模式符合您组织的需求？ 激活密钥标签名称示例： sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le 包含的通道 在创建激活密钥时，您还需要注意哪些软件通道与其关联。应为密钥指派特定的基础通道， 不建议使用默认基础通道。有关详细信息，请在 客户端注册 中查看您要安装的客户端操作系统。","title":"激活密钥","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"activation-keys","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/activation-keys.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 重新激活密钥","hash":"activation-keys-reactivation","id":1},{"text":"2. 激活密钥最佳实践","hash":"_激活密钥最佳实践","id":2}]},"59":{"id":59,"text":"If you are managing a client that is subscribed to an AppStream channel, Uyuni will filter packages available to the client depending on its currently enabled set of AppStream modules.

Kickstart 配置文件提供了大量配置选项。要创建这些配置文件，您可以上载它们，也可以使用专用向导。 Kickstart 配置文件允许您使用文件保留列表。如果您有许多自定义配置文件位于要使用 Kickstart 重新安装的客户端上，则可以将它们保存为列表，并将该列表与 Kickstart 配置文件相关联。 Procedure: Creating a File Preservation List 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 自动安装 文件保留，然后单击 创建文件保留列表。 输入适当的标签，并列出要保存的所有文件和目录的绝对路径。 单击 创建列表。 将该文件保留列表包含到 Kickstart 配置文件中。 导航到系统 自动安装 配置文件，选择要编辑的配置文件，转到系统细节 文件保留子选项卡，然后选择要包含的文件保留列表。 文件保留列表总大小上限为 1 MB。/dev/hda1 和 /dev/sda1 等特殊设备无法保留。只能使用文件名和目录名，不能使用正则表达式通配符。 有关 Kickstart 的详细信息，请参见 Red Hat 文档。 安装文件的部分内容在安装过程中会被替换。变量会被替换为相应的单个值，代码段会被替换为整段文本。转义符或转义部分不会被替换。 名为 Cheetah 的模板引擎允许 Cobbler 进行这些替换。利用此机制，您在重新安装大量系统时就无需为每个系统手动创建配置文件。 您可以在 Uyuni Web UI 中创建自动安装变量和代码段。在配置文件中，自动安装文件选项卡可让您查看替换的结果。 有关变量的信息，请参见变量。 有关代码段的信息，请参见代码段。 有关转义符或文本块的信息，请参见转义。 可以使用自动安装变量来替换 Kickstart 和 AutoYaST 配置文件中的值。要定义变量，请从配置文件中导航到变量子选项卡，然后在文本框中创建 name=value 对。 例如，您可以创建一个变量来存储客户端的 IP 地址，创建另一个变量来存储其网关的地址。然后可以为通过同一配置文件安装的所有客户端定义这些变量。要执行此操作，请将下面几行添加到变量文本框中： ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 要使用变量，请在配置文件中附加一个 $ 符号来替换相应值。例如，Kickstart 文件的 network 部分可能如下所示： network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway $ipaddr 会解析为 192.168.0.28，$gateway 会解析为 192.168.0.1。 在安装文件中，变量使用层次结构。系统变量优先于配置文件变量，而配置文件变量优先于发行套件变量。 Uyuni 附带了大量预定义的代码段。导航到系统 自动安装 自动安装代码段，以查看现有代码段列表。 通过在自动安装文件中插入 $SNIPPET() 宏来使用代码段。例如，在 Kickstart 中，插入该宏： $SNIPPET('spacewalk/rhel_register_script') 或者，在 AutoYaST 中，插入该宏： $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script') 宏会经过 Cobbler 的分析，并会替换为代码段的内容。您还可以存储自己的代码段，以供日后在自动安装文件中使用。单击 创建代码段 以创建新代码段。 下面的示例设置了通用硬盘分区配置的 Kickstart 代码段： clearpart --all part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary part swap --recommended part pv.00 --size=1 --grow volgroup vg00 pv.00 logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000 下面是使用该代码段的一个示例： $SNIPPET('my_partition') 如果自动安装文件包含 $(example) 这样的外壳脚本变量，则需要使用反斜杠对内容进行转义：\\$(example)。对 $ 符号进行转义可防止模板引擎将该符号评估为内部变量。 可以使用 \\#raw 和 \\#end raw 指令封装代码段或脚本等文本块，从而对其转义。例如： #raw #!/bin/bash for i in {0..2}; do echo \"$i - Hello World!\" done #end raw 所有包含 # 符号后接空格的行均视为注释行，因此不会对其进行评估。例如： # start some section（此为注释） echo \"Hello, world\" # end some section（此为注释）","title":"自动安装配置文件","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-profiles","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-profiles.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 声明配置文件","hash":"declare-profile","id":1},{"text":"2.

When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted when the channel is refreshed or the first package is installed from this channel. 软件通道页面中的 GPG 密钥 URL 参数可以包含以空格分隔的多个密钥 URL。如果其为文件 URL，则必须在使用软件通道之前在客户端上部署 GPG 密钥文件。 The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. 由于基于 Debian 的系统仅会对元数据签名，因此不需要为各个通道指定确切的密钥。如果用户按 为储存库元数据签名 中的“使用自己的 GPG 密钥”所述配置了自己的 GPG 密钥来对元数据签名，系统会自动部署并信任该密钥。 Users can define custom GPG keys to be deployed to a client. 通过提供某些 pillar 数据并在 Salt 文件系统中提供 GPG 密钥文件，系统会自动将它们部署到客户端。 这些密钥会分别部署到 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/（在基于 RPM 的操作系统上）和 /usr/share/keyrings/（在 Debian 系统上）中： 为您要将密钥部署到的客户端定义 pillar 键 custom_gpgkeys 并列出密钥文件名。 cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg 此外，在 Salt 文件系统中创建名为 gpg 的目录，并将 custom_gpgkeys pillar 数据中所指定的 GPG 密钥文件存储在该目录下。 ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg The keys are deployed to the client at /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key and /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg. 最后一步是将 URL 添加到软件通道的“GPG 密钥 URL”字段中。请导航到软件 管理 通道，然后选择要修改的通道。将值 file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 添加到 GPG 密钥 URL中。 过程：在客户端上使用引导脚本信任 GPG 密钥 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，检查 /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ 目录的内容。此目录包含所有可用的公共密钥。记下为您正在注册的客户端指派的通道适用的密钥。 打开相关的引导脚本，找到 ORG_GPG_KEY= 参数并添加所需的密钥。例如： uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key 您无需删除任何以前存储的密钥。 信任 GPG 密钥对于客户端的安全非常重要。由管理员来决定需要哪些密钥，可以信任哪些密钥。如果不信任 GPG 密钥，便无法为客户端指派软件通道。 openEuler clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.

It leverages the enterprise hardened security and compliance components of SUSE Linux Enterprise and merges them with a modern, immutable, developer-friendly OS platform. The openSUSE Leap Micro uses transactional updates. Transactional updates are atomic (all updates are applied only if all updates succeed) and support rollbacks.

Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. openSUSE Leap Micro clients require reboot after registering. Following the bootstrapping process, automatic booting is disabled on openSUSE Leap Micro. This change was implemented due to intermittent automatic reboots, which could occurr before Salt could relay the results of applying the bootstrap salt state. Reboot is automatically scheduled after registration is completed, but it is respecting the default reboot manager maintenance window. This window may be several hours after the client is registered. To speed up openSUSE Leap Micro registration, manually reboot the client after the registration script finishes. 要注册您的客户端，需要有引导储存库。默认会自动创建引导储存库，并且每天会为所有同步的产品重新生成该储存库。您可以在命令提示符处使用以下命令手动创建引导储存库： mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。","title":"Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-opensuseleapmicro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-opensuseleapmicro.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":1},{"text":"2. 注册客户端","hash":"_注册客户端","id":2}]},"88":{"id":88,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 添加软件通道 2. 检查同步状态 3. 创建激活密钥 4. 管理 GPG 密钥 5. 注册客户端 This section contains information about registering clients running Oracle Linux operating systems. 目前不支持直接将 Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) 储存库与 Uyuni 同步。必须使用 ULN 的 Oracle 本地发行版。有关设置本地 ULN 镜像的详细信息，请参见 https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/software-management/sfw-mgmt-UseSoftwareDistributionMirrors.html#local-uln-mirror 上提供的相关 Oracle 文档。 将 Oracle Linux 客户端注册到您的 Uyuni 服务器之前，您需要添加所需的软件通道，并同步这些通道。 当前支持的系统结构为 x86_64 和 aarch64。有关支持的产品和体系结构的完整列表，请参见 支持的客户端和功能。 下面的小节中的说明通常默认使用 x86_64 体系结构。请根据情况将其替换为其他体系结构。 此过程所需的通道包括： Table 1.

Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. You need to create an activation key that is associated with your Raspberry Pi OS channels. 有关激活密钥的详细信息，请参见 激活密钥。 安装软件包之前，客户端会使用 GPG 密钥检查这些软件包的真实性。只有可信软件才能安装在客户端上。 信任 GPG 密钥对于客户端的安全非常重要。由管理员来决定需要哪些密钥，可以信任哪些密钥。这是因为如果不信任 GPG 密钥，便无法使用软件通道，是否将通道指派给客户端取决于是否信任密钥。 有关 GPG 密钥的详细信息，请参见 GPG 密钥。 Raspberry Pi OS clients can require multiple GPG keys to be installed. When synchronizing third-party Raspberry Pi OS repositories, you will need to import the appropriate GPG key on the server. If the GPG key is missing, synchronization will fail. For Raspberry Pi OS repositories, only the metadata is signed. Therefore importing a GPG key for the software channel is not needed. Packages will not be re-signed by Uyuni. 要查看已导入 Uyuni 服务器的 GPG 密钥，请运行以下命令： mgrctl exec -- gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys To import a new GPG key, run the following command: mgradm gpg add .gpg The root user on Raspberry Pi OS is disabled by default for SSH access. 要想能够使用普通用户进行初始配置，您需要编辑 sudoers 文件。 过程：向 Root 用户授予访问权限 在客户端上，编辑 sudoers 文件： sudo visudo 在 sudoers 文件末尾添加下面一行，以向用户授予 sudo 访问权限。以在 Web UI 中引导客户端的用户的名称替换 ： ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 此过程无需口令便可授予 root 访问权限，而注册客户端需要提供口令。客户端成功安装后会以 root 特权运行，因此将不再需要该访问权限。客户端成功安装之后，建议您从 sudoers 文件中去除该行。 要注册您的客户端，需要有引导储存库。默认会自动创建引导储存库，并且每天会为所有同步的产品重新生成该储存库。您可以在命令提示符处使用以下命令手动创建引导储存库： mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。","title":"Registering Raspberry Pi OS Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-raspberrypios","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-raspberrypios.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 准备注册","hash":"_准备注册","id":1},{"text":"2. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":2},{"text":"3. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":3},{"text":"4. 创建激活密钥","hash":"_创建激活密钥","id":4},{"text":"5. 管理 GPG 密钥","hash":"_管理_gpg_密钥","id":5},{"text":"6.

Following the bootstrapping process, automatic booting is disabled on SLE Micro clients. This change was implemented due to intermittent automatic reboots, which could occurr before Salt could relay the results of applying the bootstrap Salt state. Although a reboot is automatically scheduled after registration is completed, it is respecting the default reboot manager maintenance window. This window may be several hours after the client is registered. It is advisable to manually reboot the client after the registration script finishes, to speed up the registration and to see the system appear in the system list. 要注册您的客户端，需要有引导储存库。默认会自动创建引导储存库，并且每天会为所有同步的产品重新生成该储存库。您可以在命令提示符处使用以下命令手动创建引导储存库： mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。 对 SLE Micro 系统使用引导脚本时，请确保脚本的 certificate 部分包含以下内容： ORG_CA_CERT=RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT ORG_CA_CERT_IS_RPM_YN=0 直接编辑引导脚本并添加该设置，或使用以下参数创建引导脚本： mgr-bootstrap --script=bootstrap-sle-micro.sh \\ --ssl-cert=/srv/www/htdocs/pub/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT SLE Micro 是一种事务系统。事务更新一般支持数种重引导方法。建议在 Uyuni 所管理的系统中使用 systemd来进行重引导。使用其他方法可能会导致系统出现意外行为。 如果 Uyuni 上的事务系统使用的是默认配置，引导该系统时，systemd 将会配置为引导方法 (REBOOT_METHOD)。该默认配置允许 Uyuni 控制重引导操作，重引导可以立即执行或使用 Uyuni 根据需要安排重引导时间。 默认情况下，在安装客户端的过程中会将重引导方法设置为 auto。采用 auto 引导方法时，如果 rebootmgrd 正在运行，将使用该服务根据配置的策略来重引导系统。策略可能设置为立即重引导或在维护时段重引导。有关详细信息，请参见 rebootmgrd(8) 手册页。如果 rebootmgrd 没有运行，Uyuni 将会调用 systemctl reboot。 使用 systemd 之外的任何其他方法都可能会导致系统出现意外行为。","title":"注册 SLE Micro 客户端","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-slemicro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-slemicro.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":1},{"text":"2. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":2},{"text":"3. 注册客户端","hash":"_注册客户端","id":3},{"text":"4. 重引导 SLE Micro","hash":"clients-slemicro-reboot","id":4},{"text":"4.1. 背景信息","hash":"_背景信息","id":5}]},"96":{"id":96,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 添加软件通道 This section contains information about registering clients running SUSE Liberty Linux operating systems.

These packages offer longer maintenance (10 to 12 years) for several operating system components and selected applications. These repositories can also be synchronized within Uyuni if you extract the required GPG keys and your personal Bearer Token from a system registered to Ubuntu Pro. Register an Ubuntu host with Ubuntu Pro. You will find your personal registration token in the Ubuntu Pro Dashbaord. An Ubuntu One acconut is required for this. sudo apt-get install ubuntu-advantage-tools sudo pro attach After registration, you will find the Bearer Token in the file /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/90ubuntu-advantage: machine esm.ubuntu.com/apps/ubuntu/ login bearer password # ubuntu-pro-client machine esm.ubuntu.com/infra/ubuntu/ login bearer password # ubuntu-pro-client One dedicated bearer token is used per repository. Configure the following repositories within Uyuni: Use the following URLs for creating the repositories: Table 3. Ubuntu ESM repositories URL Description https://bearer:@esm.ubuntu.com/infra/ubuntu/dists/-infra-updates/main/binary-/ Operating system functional updates https://bearer:@esm.ubuntu.com/infra/ubuntu/dists/-infra-security/main/binary-/ Operating system security updates https://bearer:@esm.ubuntu.com/apps/ubuntu/dists/-apps-updates/main/binary-/ Application functional updates https://bearer:@esm.ubuntu.com/apps/ubuntu/dists/-apps-security/main/binary-/ Application security updates Replace with your personal Bearer Token. Also, arch and release must be replaced with one of the following values: Table 4. Ubuntu ESM architectures and releases Architectures Releases amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x bionic, focal, jammy, noble, trusty, xenial In order for Uyuni to synchronize the repositories, the corresponding GPG keys (ubuntu-advantage-esm-infra-trusty.gpg, ubuntu-advantage-esm-apps.gpg) must be imported. These are located on a system registered with Ubuntu Pro under /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d. Copy these files to the Uyuni system and import them as follows: mgradm gpg add /path/to/gpg.key Create the appropriate child channels below already synchronized Ubuntu parent channels. After that, repositories can be synchronized. The procedure shown here can be used to circumvent the subscription limitations - however, this constitutes a breach of the Terms of Service and may have legal consequences. There must always be sufficient subscriptions for the number of systems used. 过程：在 Web UI 中检查同步进度 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与储存库关联的通道。 导航到储存库选项卡，然后单击同步并选中同步状态。 过程：在命令提示符处检查同步进度 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，以 root 身份使用 tail 命令检查同步日志文件： tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log 每个子通道在同步过程中都会生成自己的日志。 您需要检查所有基础通道和子通道日志文件，以确保同步已完成。 Ubuntu 通道可能会非常大。同步所需的时间可能会长达数小时。 安装软件包之前，客户端会使用 GPG 密钥检查这些软件包的真实性。只有可信软件才能安装在客户端上。 信任 GPG 密钥对于客户端的安全非常重要。由管理员来决定需要哪些密钥，可以信任哪些密钥。这是因为如果不信任 GPG 密钥，便无法使用软件通道，是否将通道指派给客户端取决于是否信任密钥。 有关 GPG 密钥的详细信息，请参见 GPG 密钥。 默认会为 Ubuntu 上的 root 用户禁用 SSH 访问权限。 要想能够使用普通用户进行初始配置，您需要编辑 sudoers 文件。 This issue happens with self-installed versions of Ubuntu. If the default user has been granted administrative privileges during installation time, a password is required to perform privilege escalation using sudo. With cloud instances this does not happen because cloud-init automatically creates a file under /etc/sudoers.d and grants privilege escalation through sudo without the need for a password. 过程：向 Root 用户授予访问权限 在客户端上，编辑 sudoers 文件： sudo visudo 在 sudoers 文件末尾添加下面一行，以向用户授予 sudo 访问权限。以在 Web UI 中引导客户端的用户的名称替换 ： ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 此过程无需口令便可授予 root 访问权限，而注册客户端需要提供口令。客户端成功安装后会以 root 特权运行，因此将不再需要该访问权限。客户端成功安装之后，建议您从 sudoers 文件中去除该行。 要注册您的客户端，需要有引导储存库。默认会自动创建引导储存库，并且每天会为所有同步的产品重新生成该储存库。您可以在命令提示符处使用以下命令手动创建引导储存库： mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。","title":"注册 Ubuntu 20.04 和 22.04 客户端","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-ubuntu","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-ubuntu.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":1},{"text":"2.

For more information about Salt in general, see Salt Guide Overview. Software updates are generally pushed from the server to the client. Connections are initiated from the client. This means you must open ports on the server, not on clients. The Salt clients are also known as Salt minions. Uyuni Server installs a daemon on every client. If you need to use Salt clients in a disconnected setup you can configure SSH Push as a contact method. With this contact method, clients can be located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. For more information about SSH Push, see SSH Push Contact Method. Salt has its own database to keep the keys for the minions. This needs to be kept in sync with the Uyuni database. As soon as the key is accepted in Salt, the onboarding process in Uyuni starts. The onboarding process will look for existing systems in the Uyuni database by searching for the minion_id and the machine-id. Depending on the outcome, the following scenarios are possible: If nothing is found, the new system gets created. In case an entry with the minion_id or the machine-id is found, that system will be migrated to match the new system. In case there is a match for both entries, and they are not the same system, the onboarding will be aborted with an error. In this case the administrator needs to resolve the conflict by removing at least one of the systems.","title":"Default Contact Method (Salt)","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-default","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-default.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 初始配置细节","hash":"onboarding-details","id":1}]},"102":{"id":102,"text":"There are three contact methods how the Uyuni Server can communicate with clients. They are based on Salt protocols. Which Salt contact method you use depends on the type of client, and your network architecture: Default (Salt) is the default choice and is recommended unless there are specific needs. For more information, see Default Contact Method (Salt). SSH Push is useful only if network restrictions make it impossible for clients to establish contact to the server. It is supported with the Salt Bundle only. This contact method has serious limitations. For more information, see SSH Push Contact Method. SSH Push (with tunnel) is the same as SSH Push, but with using a secured communication tunnel. For more information, see SSH Push (With Tunnel) Contact Method. Implementation of Salt communication software options: Salt 捆绑包 is a single binary package containing Salt Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries. Thus the Salt contact method is independent from software installed on the client. Using the Salt Bundle is the default. It is the only supported implementation for the SSH Push or SSH Push (with tunnel) contact method. For more information, see Salt 捆绑包. Salt Minion is Salt software installed on the client system. The so-called traditional contact protocol is no longer supported with Uyuni 5.0 and later. Before upgrading from Uyuni 4 to 5, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt or replaced with Salt proxies.

Using the Salt Bundle with the Salt Minion 2.2. Switching from Salt Minion to Salt Bundle 3. SSH Push with the Salt Bundle 4. 使用 pip 通过 Python 软件包扩展 Salt 捆绑包 The Salt Bundle is a single binary package containing Salt Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries. The Salt Bundle is shipped with Python 3 and all the requirements for Salt to run. Thus Salt Bundle does not use the Python version install on the client as system software. The Salt Bundle can be installed on clients that do not meet the requirements for a given Salt version. It is also possible to use the Salt Bundle on systems that run a Salt Minion connected to a Salt Master other than the Uyuni Salt Master. The registration method with the Salt Bundle is the recommended registration method. This section explains the advantages and limitations of the current implementation. The Salt Bundle is provided as the venv-salt-minion that consists of Salt, Python 3, and the Python modules Salt depends on. Bootstrapping with Web UI is using Salt Bundle as well, so bootstrapping with Web UI is not Python dependant. Using the Salt Bundle, it is no longer needed that the client provides any Python interpreter or modules. 如果您引导新客户端，默认的注册方法是使用 Salt 捆绑包注册。您可以将现有客户端切换为使用 Salt 捆绑包方法。如果切换，将会安装 salt-minion 软件包及其依赖项。 The Salt Bundle can be used with the Salt Minion managed by the Salt Master other than Uyuni Server at the same time. If the Salt Bundle is installed on a client Uyuni Server will manage the configuration files of the Salt Bundle, the configuration files of salt-minion will not be managed in this case. For more information, see Salt Bundle configuration. To bootstrap a client with the Salt Minion managed by the Salt Master other than Uyuni Server it is recommended to use mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle when generating the bootstrap script, or to set FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION to 1 in the bootstrap script. 要使用 Web UI 进行引导，可以全局指定 mgr_force_venv_salt_minion 设为 true 的 pillar。有关详细信息，请参见 Salt States and Pillars。 The Salt state util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion is available to switch from salt-minion to venv-salt-minion. It is recommended to switch to venv-salt-minion in two steps to avoid trouble with shifting processes: 过程：使用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 状态切换到 venv-salt-minion 首先，在不指定任何 pillar 的情况下应用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion。这样会通过复制配置文件等数据切换到 venv-salt-minion。此过程不会清理原始的 salt-minion 配置及其软件包。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 在 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt 设为 True（用于去除 salt-minion）以及 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files 设为 True（用于去除与 salt-minion 相关的所有文件）的情况下应用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion。此第二步用于确保第一步已经处理，然后去除旧配置文件以及现已过时的 salt-minion 软件包。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' 如果切换过程中跳过第一步来运行第二步，状态应用过程可能会失败，因为此过程需要停止用于在客户端执行命令的 salt-minion。 反过来，您也可以不安装 Salt 捆绑包，而是继续使用 salt-minion。在此情况下，请指定以下其中一个选项： 指定 --no-bundle 选项来执行 mgr-bootstrap。 在生成的引导脚本中，将 AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION 设为 1。 对于引导状态，将 mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillar 设为 True。 The Salt Bundle is also used when performing SSH Push actions to clients. A shell script deploys the Salt Bundle onto the target system without installing venv-salt-minion before any Salt command is executed. Because the Salt Bundle contains the whole Salt code base, no salt-thin is deployed. SSH Push (including bootstrapping using the Web UI) uses the Python 3 interpreter within the bundle. The target system does not need to have any other Python interpreter installed. The Python 3 deployed with the Bundle is used to handle SSH Push session on the client, so SSH Push (including bootstrapping with Web UI) is not dependant on Python installed on the system. Using salt-thin can be enabled as a fallback method, but it requires Python 3 to be installed on the client. This method is not recommended nor supported and exists for development purposes only. Set web.ssh_use_salt_thin to true in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. The bootstrap repository must be created before bootstrapping the client with Web UI. SSH Push is using the Salt Bundle taken from the bootstrap repository based on the detected target operating system. For more information, see client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository. SSH Push is using /var/tmp to deploy Salt Bundle to and execute Salt commands on the client with the bundled Python. Therefore you must not mount /var/tmp with the noexec option. It is not possible to bootstrap the clients, which have /var/tmp mounted with noexec option, with the Web UI because the bootstrap process is using SSH Push to reach a client. The Salt Bundle includes pip to make it possible to extend the functionality of the bundled Salt Minion with extra Python packages. 默认情况下，salt pip.install 会将 指定的 Python 软件包安装到 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local 中。 如果需要，可以通过为 venv-salt-minion.service 设置 VENV_PIP_TARGET 环境变量来覆盖路径 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local。建议为该服务使用 systemd 普适性配置文件。可以使用配置文件 /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf 来实现该目的： [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip The Python packages installed through pip are not changing on updating the Salt Bundle. To ensure that such packages are available and functional after an update, it is recommended to install them with a Salt state that is applied after Salt Bundle updates.","title":"Salt 捆绑包","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 什么是 Salt 捆绑包？","hash":"_什么是_salt_捆绑包","id":1},{"text":"2. 使用 Salt 捆绑包将客户端注册为受控端","hash":"_使用_salt_捆绑包将客户端注册为受控端","id":2},{"text":"2.1.

After all actions and events are executed, the tunnel is closed. 服务器使用 SSH 定期联系客户端，以签入和执行安排的操作和事件。 Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with SSH Push. The tunnel is used to provide the access to the server through the encrypted tunnel. The repositories assigned to the SSH Push client (with tunnel) are provided through this tunnel only, thus it is not possible to use package manager tools directly from the client system because the repositories are available only while the tunnel is up. In other words, access is only possible if the session is initiated by the server. All package managing operations on the client can be performed from the server side only. For tunneling connections via SSH, a port number is required for tunneling via HTTPS. The port number used by default is 1233. To overwrite it, you can add a custom port numbers greater than 1024 to /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: ssh_push_port_https = high_port After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service. To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart spacewalk-service as root: spacewalk-service restart 出于安全原因，您可能需要结合使用 sudo 和 SSH，以非特权用户身份而不是 root 身份访问系统。 过程：配置非特权 SSH 访问 在每个客户端系统上，创建相应的非特权用户。 On each client system, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo 在 sudoers 文件末尾添加下面一行，以向用户授予 sudo 访问权限。以在 Web UI 中引导客户端的用户的名称替换 ： ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 此过程无需口令便可授予 root 访问权限，而注册客户端需要提供口令。客户端成功安装后会以 root 特权运行，因此将不再需要该访问权限。客户端成功安装之后，建议您从 sudoers 文件中去除该行。 在 Uyuni 服务器上，于 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 配置文件中添加或修改下面一行以包含非特权用户名： ssh_push_sudo_user = After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service. To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart spacewalk-service as root: spacewalk-service restart You need to use the Web UI or API to register these clients with the Uyuni Server. Before you begin, you need to ensure that you have specified which ports to use for SSH tunneling. If you have registered clients before changing the port numbers, they need to be registered again with a re-activation key. For more information about bootstrapping, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. For more information about bootstrapping, see client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc#activation-keys-reactivation. Example: API access to SSH Push (with tunnel) You can use the API to manage which contact method to use. This example Python code sets the contact method to ssh-push-tunnel. 有效值为： default (pull) ssh-push ssh-push-tunnel client = xmlrpclib.Server(SUMA_HOST + \"/rpc/api\", verbose=0) key = client.auth.login(SUMA_LOGIN, SUMA_PASSWORD) client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push-tunnel'})","title":"SSH Push (With Tunnel) Contact Method","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltssh-tunnel","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltssh-tunnel.html","titles":[]},"105":{"id":105,"text":"Table of Contents 1. Available parameters 2. 操作的执行 3. Future features 3.1. 更多信息 SSH Push (ssh-push) is used in environments where Salt clients cannot reach the Uyuni Server directly. In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network where the Uyuni Server is located. SSH Push is also to use if installing a daemon agent on clients is not possible. The SSH Push method has serious limitations. It does not scale well, and consumes more Server resources and network bandwidth than the plain Salt method (default). The Push SSH method is not at all supported with large setups (1000 clients and more). The server uses the SSH Push to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. Re-installing systems using the provisioning model is not currently supported on clients managed with SSH Push. This image demonstrates the SSH Push process path. All items left of the Taskomatic block represent processes running on the Uyuni client. To use SSH Push, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the salt-api daemon running on the Uyuni Server. Additionally, the required Python version will be deployed with the Salt Bundle on the client system. Before beginning with the following registering procedure, define an activation key with the SSH Push contact method configured. This method expects that there is a direct connection with HTTPS to the Server. You need to use the Web UI or API to register these clients with the Uyuni Server. See the following procedure or example. Procedure: Registering clients with SSH Push 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 引导，然后填写相应的字段。 Select an activation key with the SSH Push contact method configured. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. 选中完全通过 SSH 管理系统复选框。 单击 Bootstrap 开始注册。 导航到系统 概览，确认该系统已正确注册。 例如：使用 API 访问通过 SSH 推送方法 您可以使用 API 来管理要使用的联系方法。下面的示例 Python 代码将联系方法设为 ssh-push。 有效值为： default (pull) ssh-push ssh-push-tunnel client = xmlrpclib.Server(SUMA_HOST + \"/rpc/api\", verbose=0) key = client.auth.login(SUMA_LOGIN, SUMA_PASSWORD) client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'}) When you are configuring SSH Push, you can modify parameters that are used when a system is registered, including the host, activation key, and password. The password is used only for bootstrapping, it is not saved anywhere. All future SSH sessions are authorized via a key/certificate pair. These parameters are configured in Systems Bootstrapping. You can also configure persistent parameters that are used system-wide, including the sudo user to access the system as an unprivileged user instead of as root. Procedure: Configuring unprivileged SSH access 确保您已在 Uyuni 服务器上安装最新的 spacewalk-taskomatic 和 spacewalk-certs-tools 软件包。 在每个客户端系统上，创建相应的非特权用户。 On each client system, edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo 在 sudoers 文件末尾添加下面一行，以向用户授予 sudo 访问权限。以在 Web UI 中引导客户端的用户的名称替换 ： ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 此过程无需口令便可授予 root 访问权限，而注册客户端需要提供口令。客户端成功安装后会以 root 特权运行，因此将不再需要该访问权限。客户端成功安装之后，建议您从 sudoers 文件中去除该行。 在 Uyuni 服务器上，于 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 配置文件中添加或修改下面一行以包含非特权用户名： ssh_push_sudo_user = After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service. To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart the Uyuni Server as root: mgradm restart The SSH Push feature uses taskomatic to execute scheduled actions using salt-ssh. The taskomatic job periodically checks for scheduled actions and executes them. The SSH Push feature executes a complete salt-ssh call based on the scheduled action. 默认可以同时执行 20 项 Salt SSH 操作。您可以在配置文件中添加下面几行，并上调 parallel_threads 的值，以增加可同时执行的操作数。建议您将并行操作数设置为较低的值，以免出现问题： taskomatic.sshminion_action_executor.parallel_threads = org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 这样可调整任何客户端上同时运行的操作数，以及 taskomatic 使用的工作器线程总数。如果需要在多个客户端上运行操作，则每个客户端上的操作始终按顺序执行。 如果客户端是通过代理连接的，则需要调整代理上的 MaxSessions 设置。在此情况下，请将并行连接的数量设置为客户端总数的三倍。 There are some features that are not yet supported on SSH Push. These features do not work on Salt SSH clients: OpenSCAP 审计 导致以下事件的信标： 使用 zypper 在系统上安装软件包不会调用软件包刷新。 如果虚拟主机系统基于 Salt SSH，则虚拟主机功能（例如 Guest 主机）将无法正常工作。 有关 Salt SSH 的一般信息，请参见 Salt SSH 和 https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/。 有关 SSH 密钥轮替的信息，请参见 specialized-guides:salt/salt-ssh.adoc#salt.ssh.key_rotation。","title":"SSH Push Contact Method","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltssh","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

ACTIVATION_KEYS=1-sles15 ORG_GPG_KEY= 完成后，保存该文件，然后对第二个引导脚本重复此过程。 By default, bootstrap script will try to install venv-salt-minion if it is available in the bootstrap repository and salt-minion if there is no Salt bundle in the bootstrap repository. It is possible to avoid installing Salt bundle and keep using salt-minion if you need it for some reason. 有关详细信息，请参见 Salt 捆绑包。 创建好脚本后，您便可以使用它来注册客户端。 过程：运行引导脚本 On the Uyuni Server, log in as root. At the command prompt, and change to the bootstrap directory: cd /srv/www/htdocs/pub/bootstrap/ 运行以下命令在客户端上执行引导脚本（将 EXAMPLE.COM 替换为客户端的主机名）： cat bootstrap-sles15.sh | ssh root@EXAMPLE.COM /bin/bash 或者，在客户端上运行以下命令： curl -Sks https://server_hostname/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-sles15.sh | /bin/bash 为避免出现问题，请确保引导脚本是使用 bash 执行的。 此脚本会下载位于您先前创建的储存库目录下的所需依赖项。 When the script has finished running, you can check that the client is registered correctly. Open the Uyuni Web UI and navigate to Systems Overview to ensure the new client is listed. If the client is not listed, in the Uyuni Web UI navigate to Salt Keys and check whether the client key is accepted. 使用 Uyuni 在客户端上安装新的软件包或更新时，会自动接受所有最终用户许可协议 (EULA)。要查看软件包 EULA，请打开 Web UI 中的软件包细节页面。","title":"Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-bootstrap","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For example, you can define one group for all clients with web server software, and another group for all SLES clients. You can then perform updates on all clients with web server software, or use the intersection between the groups, and update all SLES clients with web server software. 在使用组对客户端分组之前，需要先创建一些组。 过程：创建新系统组 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统组。 单击 创建组。 指定新组的名称和说明。 单击 创建组 以保存组。 对需要创建的每个组重复以上步骤。 您可以向组中添加单个客户端，也可以同时添加多个客户端。 过程：将单个客户端添加到组 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，然后单击要添加的客户端的名称。 导航到组 加入选项卡。 选中要加入的组，然后单击 加入所选的组。 过程：将多个客户端添加到组 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，然后单击要向其添加客户端的组的名称。 导航到目标系统选项卡。 选中要添加的客户端，然后单击 添加系统。 过程：使用 SSM 将多个客户端添加到组 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，然后选中要添加的每个客户端，这会将这些客户端添加到系统集管理器中。 导航到系统 系统集管理器，然后转到组选项卡。 找到要加入的组并选中添加。 单击 更改成员资格。 单击 确认 将客户端加入所选的组。 有关系统集管理器的详细信息，请参见 系统集管理器。 You can see which clients are in a group by navigating to Systems System Groups, clicking the name of the group, and navigating to the Systems tab. When you have your clients arranged into groups, you can use your groups to manage updates. 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统组。如果组中的任何客户端有可用更新，列表会显示相应图标。如果组中有任何客户端的检查更新状态功能被禁用，列表会显示问号。单击图标可查看有关可用更新的详细信息，并向客户端应用更新。 您也可以同时使用多个组。选择要使用的多个组，然后单击 使用并集 以选择每个选定组中的每个客户端。 Alternatively, you can work on intersections of groups. Select two or more groups, and click Work with intersection to select only those clients that exist in all the selected groups. For example, you might have one group for all clients with web server software, and another group for all SLES clients. The intersection of these groups would be all SLES clients with web server software.","title":"系统组","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"system-groups","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/system-groups.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 创建组","hash":"_创建组","id":1},{"text":"2. 将客户端添加到组","hash":"_将客户端添加到组","id":2},{"text":"3. 使用组","hash":"_使用组","id":3}]},"150":{"id":150,"text":"Table of Contents 1. System Locks on Clients 2. 软件包锁 2.1. 基于 Zypp 的系统上的软件包锁 2.2. 类似 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 和 Debian 的系统上的软件包锁 系统锁用于防止对客户端执行某些操作。例如，系统锁可防止更新或重启动客户端。此功能对于运行生产软件的客户端或想要阻止意外更改时很有用。您可以在准备好执行操作时禁用系统锁。 When a client is locked, or put into blackout mode, no actions can be scheduled, execution commands are disabled, and a yellow banner is displayed on the System Details page. In this mode, actions can be scheduled for the locked client using the Web UI or the API, but the actions fail. The locking mechanism is not available for Salt SSH clients. Procedure: System Locking a Client 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到要锁定的客户端的系统细节页面。 导航到公式选项卡，选中系统锁公式，然后单击 保存。 导航到公式 系统锁选项卡，选中锁定系统，然后单击 保存。 在此页面上，您也可以在客户端处于锁定状态时启用特定的 Salt 模块。 进行更改后，您可能需要应用 highstate。 在此情况下，Web UI 中会显示一个标题通知您。客户端会保持锁定状态，直到您去除系统锁公式。 For more information about blackout mode in Salt, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/blackout/index.html. Package locking can be used on several clients, but different feature sets are available.

You can then set up autoinstallation using AutoYaST or Kickstart for additional virtual hosts and for virtual guests. This section also includes information about administering virtual guests after they have been installed. The way that you set up Xen or KVM on a VM host depends on operating system you want to use on its associated guests: For SUSE operating systems, see the SLES Virtualization Guide available from https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-virtualization.html. 对于 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 操作系统，请参见适用于您所用版本的 Red Hat 文档。 借助虚拟化主机公式，您可以初始化主机。有关详细信息，请参见 初始化虚拟化主机。 Uyuni uses libvirt to install and manage guests. You must have the libvirt-daemon package installed on your host. In most cases, the default settings are sufficient and you do not need to adjust them. However, if you want to access the VNC console on your guests as a non-root user, you need to perform some configuration changes. For more information about how to set up the VNC console, see the documentation for your operating system. You need a bootstrap script on the Uyuni Server. The bootstrap script must include the activation key for your host. We also recommend that you include your GPG key for additional security. For more on creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. When the bootstrap script is ready, use it to register the host with the Uyuni Server. For more information about client registration, see 客户端注册. 使用虚拟化主机公式初始化主机： 过程：初始化虚拟化主机 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到主机的系统细节页面，然后单击公式选项卡。 选择虚拟化主机公式，然后单击 保存。 单击虚拟化主机子选项卡。 选中相应设置，然后单击 保存公式。 应用 Highstate，以使更改生效。 重启动 salt-minion 服务以激活新配置： systemctl restart salt-minion 您可以使用 AutoYaST 或 Kickstart 自动安装并注册 Xen 和 KVM Guest。 You need an activation key for the VM host you want to register the guests to, and for each guest. The activation key must have the provisioning and Virtualization Platform entitlements. For more information about creating activation keys, see 激活密钥. If you want to automatically register the guests with Uyuni after installation, you need to create a bootstrap script. For more information about creating a bootstrap script, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. 您需要在 VM 主机上创建可自动安装的发行套件，才能通过 Uyuni 自动安装客户端。可以在挂载的本地或远程目录提供发行套件，也可以在以循环方式挂载的 ISO 映像中提供。 The configuration of the autoinstallable distribution differs depending on whether you are using a Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE operating system on your guests. The packages for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation are fetched from the associated base channel. Packages for installing SUSE systems are fetched from the autoinstallable distribution. Therefore, for SUSE systems, the autoinstallable distribution must be a complete installation source. Table 1.

When the instance is unreachable, the credential update process will fail and the credentials will become invalid after the second failed refresh. Synchronization of channels will fail when the credentials are invalid. To avoid this keep the connected instances running. 除非明确删除了 SSH 连接数据，否则 PAYG 实例将一直连接到 Uyuni 服务器。要删除实例的 SSH 连接数据，请执行Procedure: Deleting Connection Data to Instance。 并非在任何时间都可从 Uyuni 服务器访问 PAYG 实例。 如果实例存在但已停止，系统将使用最新的已知身份凭证尝试连接实例。 身份凭证的有效时长取决于云提供商。 如果实例不再存在，但在 SUMA 中仍保持注册状态，其身份凭证将不再有效，身份验证将会失败。 “状态”列中会显示错误消息。 错误消息只会指出实例不再可用。云提供商需要对实例的状态进行进一步诊断。 在 PAYG 实例中进行以下任意操作或更改都将导致身份凭证失效： * 去除 zypper 身份凭证文件 * 去除导入的证书 * 从 /etc/hosts 中去除特定于云的条目 您可以将从中收集身份凭证的 PAYG 实例注册为 Salt 客户端。需要为实例注册有效的云连接，否则它将无法访问通道。如果用户去除相关云软件包，身份凭证收集可能会停止工作。 首先，将 PAYG 实例设置为收集身份验证数据，以使其可以同步通道。 该过程的其余步骤与非公有云客户端的步骤相同，包括同步通道、自动创建引导脚本、创建激活密钥，以及启动注册。 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。 检查身份凭证 如果脚本无法收集身份凭证，将会在日志和 Web UI 中提供正确的错误消息。 如果身份凭证无法工作，reposync 应该会显示正确的错误消息。 使用 registercloudguest 刷新或更改 registercloudguest 与公有云更新基础架构的连接不应影响身份凭证的使用。 如果未使用 cloud guest 命令注册新的云连接，运行 registercloudguest --clean 将会导致发生问题。","title":"Connect PAYG Instance","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"connect-payg","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/connect-payg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Uyuni 性能取决于硬件资源、网络带宽、客户端与服务器之间的延迟，等等。 根据所用体验和部署方式的不同，Uyuni 服务器与足够数量的代理配套使用时，建议每个服务器处理的客户端不要超过 10,000 个，以便获得最佳性能。当客户端数量超过 10,000 个时，强烈建议改为使用集线器设置并咨询相关专业人员。即使优化了设置并配备了充足的代理，数量如此庞大的客户端也可能导致发生性能问题。 For more information about managing a large number of clients, see Multiple Servers with Hub to Manage Large Scale Deployments.

If there is not enough space available, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages. 鉴于这种行为： The larger /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/ directory is on the proxy, the less traffic will be between the proxy and the Uyuni Server. By making the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/ directory on the proxy the same size as /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/ on the Uyuni Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization. The /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache/ directory can be small on the Uyuni Server compared to the proxy. For a guide to size estimation, see the 服务器要求 section. PostgreSQL 是唯一受支持的数据库。不支持使用远程 PostgreSQL 数据库或装有 PostgreSQL 数据库的远程文件系统（例如 NFS）。换句话说，PostgreSQL 应该位于 Uyuni 可用的最快的存储设备上。 Because of potential performance issues, running a PostgreSQL database remotely from Uyuni is discouraged. While such an environment is possible and even stable in many cases, there is always a risk of data loss if something goes wrong. Persistent volumes are created by default when deploying the container. However, it is recommended that the repositories and the database for Uyuni are stored on separate storage devices. Such a setup helps avoid data loss in production environments. Storage devices must be set up prior to deploying the container. For more details, see Persistent Container Volumes. Uyuni 需要三个不同的卷： Database volume: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql Channel volume: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk Cache: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache 我们建议使用 XFS 作为所有卷的文件系统类型。此外，对于本地安装，请考虑使用逻辑卷管理 (LVM) 来管理磁盘。用于存储储存库的磁盘大小取决于您要使用 Uyuni 管理的发行套件和通道数目。请参见本节中的表格来估算所需大小。 On the Uyuni Server, use this command to find all available storage devices: hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" 使用 lsblk 命令查看每个设备的名称和大小。 结合设备名使用 suma-storage 命令将外部磁盘设置为数据库和储存库的位置： suma-storage [] 外部存储卷将设置为挂载到 /manager_storage 和 /pgsql_storage 的 XFS 分区。 可对通道数据和数据库使用同一个存储设备。但不建议这样做，因为不断增长的通道储存库可能会填满存储，从而给数据库完整性带来风险。使用独立的存储设备还可以提高性能。如果您想要使用单个存储设备，请结合单个设备名参数运行 suma-storage。 如果您正在安装代理，suma-storage 命令只采用单个设备名参数，并将外部存储位置设置为 Squid 缓存。 为 Uyuni 服务器和代理创建磁盘分区时，请确保正确设置权限。 For /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql: 拥有者：读取、写入、执行 Group: Read, Execute 用户：无 For /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk: 拥有者：读取、写入、执行 组：读取、写入、执行 用户：读取、执行 使用以下命令检查权限： ls -l /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk 输出应如下所示： /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql: total 0 drwxr-x--- 1 10556 10556 48 Apr 19 14:33 _data /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk: total 0 drwxr-xr-x 1 10552 root 30 Apr 19 14:34 _data 如果需要，请使用以下命令更改权限： chmod 750 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql chmod 775 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk 对于拥有者，请使用以下命令： chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql chown wwwrun:www /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk","title":"硬件要求","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 服务器要求","hash":"server-hardware-requirements","id":1},{"text":"2. 代理要求","hash":"_代理要求","id":2},{"text":"3.

This service forwards Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. 代理链 It is possible to arrange proxies in a chain. In such a case, the upstream proxy is named parent. 确保 TCP 端口 4505 和 4506 已在代理上打开。代理必须能够在这些端口上访问 Uyuni 服务器或父代理。 代理将与 Uyuni 服务器共享一些 SSL 信息。请从 Uyuni 服务器或父代理复制证书及其密钥。 在代理上，以 root 身份使用您的 Uyuni 服务器或父代理（名为 PARENT）输入以下命令： mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@PARENT:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . 为使安全链保持不变，Uyuni Proxy 功能要求为 SSL 证书签名的 CA 与为 Uyuni Server 证书签名的 CA 相同。不支持对代理和服务器使用由不同 CA 签名的证书。 configure-proxy.sh 脚本将完成 Uyuni Proxy 的设置。 执行交互式 configure-proxy.sh 脚本。如果在不提供其他输入的情况下按 Enter，脚本将使用方括号 [] 中提供的默认值。下面是有关所请求设置的一些信息： Uyuni 父项：Uyuni 父项可以是另一个代理或 Uyuni 服务器。 HTTP 代理 Uyuni Proxy 可以通过 HTTP 代理访问 Web。如果防火墙禁止直接访问 Web，则需要使用 HTTP 代理。 回溯电子邮件 要将问题报告到的电子邮件地址。 使用 SSL 出于安全原因，请按 Y。 您要导入现有证书吗？ 请按 N。这可以确保使用前面从 Uyuni 服务器复制的新证书。 组织 下一组问题与代理 SSL 证书的用法特征有关。组织可能是服务器上使用的同一组织，当然，如果您的代理不在主服务器所在的同一组织中，则两个组织是不同的。 组织单位 此处的默认值是代理的主机名。 城市 附加到代理证书的其他信息。 州/省 附加到代理证书的其他信息。 国家/地区代码 在国家/地区代码字段中，输入安装 Uyuni 期间设置的国家/地区代码。例如，如果您的代理位于美国，而 Uyuni 位于德国，请为代理输入 DE。 国家/地区代码必须是两个大写字母。有关国家/地区代码的完整列表，请参见 https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search。 CNAME 别名（空格分隔） 如果可以通过不同的 DNS CNAME 别名访问您的代理，请使用此字段。否则可将其留空。 CA 口令 输入 Uyuni 服务器的证书使用的口令。 您要使用现有的 SSH 密钥来代理 SSH-Push Salt 受控端吗？ 如果您要重复使用对服务器上的 SSH-Push Salt 客户端所用的 SSH 密钥，请使用此选项。 如果缺少某些部分（例如 CA 密钥和公共证书），脚本将列显必须执行的以集成所需文件的命令。复制必需的文件后，请再次运行 configure-proxy.sh。如果在执行脚本期间收到 HTTP 错误，请再次运行脚本。 configure-proxy.sh 激活 Uyuni Proxy 所需的服务，例如 squid、apache2、salt-broker 和 jabberd。 要检查代理系统及其客户端的状态，请在 Web UI 中单击代理系统的细节页（单击系统 代理，然后单击系统名称）。连接和代理子选项卡会显示各种状态信息。 要通过代理启用 PXE 引导，必须在 Uyuni 代理和 Uyuni 服务器上安装并配置额外的软件。 在 Uyuni Proxy 上安装 susemanager-tftpsync-recv 软件包： zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv 在 Uyuni Proxy 上，运行 configure-tftpsync.sh 设置脚本并输入请求的信息： configure-tftpsync.sh 需要提供 Uyuni 服务器和代理的主机名与 IP 地址。此外，需要输入代理上 tftpboot 目录的路径。 在 Uyuni 服务器上安装 susemanager-tftpsync： zypper in susemanager-tftpsync 在 Uyuni 服务器上运行 configure-tftpsync.sh。 这会创建配置并将其上载到 Uyuni Proxy： configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy 在 Uyuni 服务器上启动初始同步： cobbler sync It can also be done after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. Uyuni 使用 Cobbler 进行客户端置备。PXE (tftp) 默认已安装并已激活。客户端必须能够使用 DHCP 在 Uyuni Proxy 上找到 PXE 引导。对于包含要置备的客户端的区域，请使用以下 DHCP 配置： next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" 代理不包含有关与它连接的客户端的任何信息。因此，随时可将一个代理替换为新代理。替换用的代理必须与其前任代理具有相同的名称和 IP 地址。 准备替换时，请关闭旧代理并使其保持已安装状态。为此系统创建重新激活密钥，然后使用重新激活密钥注册新代理。如果您不使用重新激活密钥，则需要针对新代理重新注册所有客户端。 仅当您不想要丢失计算机的历史记录时，才需要使用重新激活密钥。如果您不使用重新激活密钥，替换用的代理将成为具有新 ID 的“新”代理。 过程：替换代理并保持客户端的已注册状态 Before starting the actual migration procedure, save the data from the old proxy, if needed. Consider copying important or manually created data to a central place that can also be accessed by the new proxy. 关闭代理。 Deploy a new Uyuni Proxy. 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，选择新安装的 Uyuni 代理并将其从系统列表中删除。 在 Web UI 中，为旧代理系统创建重新激活密钥：在旧代理的“系统细节”选项卡上单击重新激活。 单击生成新密钥并记下新密钥，因为稍后需要用到。有关重新激活密钥的详细信息，请参见 重新激活密钥。 可选：安装新代理后，可能还需要： 将集中保存的数据复制到新代理系统 安装任何其他所需软件 设置 TFTP 同步（如果该代理用于自动安装） 在安装代理期间，客户端将无法访问 Uyuni 服务器。删除某个代理后，系统列表可能暂时不正确。以前已连接到该代理的所有客户端将显示为直接连接到服务器。在客户端上成功完成第一个操作（例如执行远程命令，或者安装软件包或补丁）后，此信息将自动更正。这种更正可能发生在几小时之后。","title":"Uyuni Proxy 设置","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"uyuni-proxy-setup","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/uyuni-proxy-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 安装 uyuni_proxy 软件集","hash":"uyuni-proxy-setup-pattern","id":1},{"text":"2. 复制服务器证书和密钥","hash":"uyuni-proxy-setup-copycert","id":2},{"text":"3. 运行 configure-proxy.sh","hash":"uyuni-proxy-setup-confproxy","id":3},{"text":"4. 启用 PXE 引导","hash":"uyuni-proxy-setup-pxe","id":4},{"text":"4.1. 同步配置文件和系统信息","hash":"proxy.pxe.sync","id":5},{"text":"4.2. 通过代理为 PXE 配置 DHCP","hash":"proxy.pxe.dhcp","id":6},{"text":"5. 更换 Uyuni 代理","hash":"replace-uyuniproxy","id":7}]},"188":{"id":188,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.

Comparing containerized and non-containerized workflows 5. Validating Saltboot group configuration To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server 4.3 or newer one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using Uyuni Server 4.3 or newer. Older images will not work. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configure DHCP for PXE booting. See DHCPd Formula how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server. Without using DHCP formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. See below for example. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Follow guide 系统组 to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. With this, our branch group is converted to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot Groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. See Terminal Names for explanation of possible configurations. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server 4.3 where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is build and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Non-Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with what parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In this example we consider architecture with dedicated network for POS terminals where branch server provides all required services including DHCP and DNS. For dedicated network we assume 192.168.86.0/24 network. In this example we provide Salt and ftp CNAMEs for Saltboot service discovery.

Deploying new images 1.1. Controlling image versions This file describes how to deploy a new image on selected terminals first, test it, and then deploy it to all terminals. The hardware type group (i.e. HWTYPE group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the Saltboot formula. This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. Procedure: Dual group image deployment Build new image. Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Saltboot Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see Image Building and Management. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see 使用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 进行监视. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The Saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the Saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the Saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the Saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Image Synchronizing to the Branch Server If you have very large images that you need to synchronize to the branch server, you can use delta images to save network bandwidth. A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be - and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar in the database. Performance tuning is possible with the -B option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure the Server to Auto-Accept 2. Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains 3. Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot You can configure Uyuni to automatically accept the keys of newly deployed terminals. This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see [retail.deployterminals.auto.once]. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, which is preserved in etc-salt volume. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept On the Uyuni Server, create file autosign_grains.conf and add this line: autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot: For multiple keys, put each one on a new line. Push new files using mgrclt cp command: mgrctl exec mkdir /etc/salt/autosign_grains mgrctl cp autosign_grains.conf server:/etc/salt/master.d/ mgrctl cp autosign_key server:/etc/salt/autosign_grains/ For more information about configuring the server to automatically accept grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/autoaccept_grains.html. Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the element, add: Save the file and rebuild the image. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot Configure the PXE formula to specify these kernel parameters during booting: SALT_AUTOSIGN_GRAINS=autosign_key: PXE boot the Salt client. The formula creates the ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf configuration file and passes it to initrd.","title":"Deploy Terminals and Auto-Accept Keys","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-auto","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-auto.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Deploy Terminals over a Wireless Network 2.1. Change Wireless Credentials 2.2. Use Multiple Wireless Networks If you are not able to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if= of= When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. Build the image. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Assign and Configure the Saltboot Formula for Each Hardware Type Group 3. Synchronize Images to the Branch Server 4. Deploy Images to the Terminals 5. Customize the Terminal Image Download Process When you have the Uyuni Server and Branch Server set up, you are ready to deploy point-of-service terminals by following these steps: Create hardware type groups Assign and configure the Saltboot formula for each hardware type group Deploy images to the terminals Each procedure is detailed in this section. For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Terminals can be either x86-64 or arm64 architecture. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see Image Building and Management. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Manual synchronization of images is needed only when using non-containerized Uyuni for Retail 4.3 branch server. Image synchronization downloads system and boot images from the Uyuni Server to the Uyuni for Retail branch server. This may involve updating default boot image for not yet registered terminals. Default boot image can be set in the Image Synchronize formula. If default boot image is not set, boot image with highest version is used as default boot image. This behaviour can be disabled by unchecking Use Latest Boot Image checkbox in the Image Synchronize formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. Create the top.sls file with content: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Create the saltboot_proto.sls file with content: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp saltboot_proto.sls server:/srv/pillar/ Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. Create the top.sls file with content: base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Create the $branch_prefix.sls file with content: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp $branch_prefix.sls server:/srv/pillar/","title":"Deployment basics","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Partitioning and Image Deployment Formula Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your Uyuni for Retail installation. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to apply common Uyuni formulas. For the most commonly used formulas, see Salt Formulas. All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server. The following formulas can be used for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3 with Uyuni 5.0: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula In addition, Bind and DHCPd formulas can be used, but not on the branch server because SLE Micro does not have Bind and DHCPd in the repositories. Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services. Use the Saltboot formula to specify disk partitioning, and to select which image should be deployed. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula.","title":"Introduction to Retail Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-formulas-intro","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-formulas-intro.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Synchronize Images to the Branch Server To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies, or containerized proxy one or more Uyuni build hosts This section covers how to configure your Uyuni for Retail environment, including: Prepare POS images Prepare system groups Configure services for Saltboot Synchronize POS images to the branch servers The very first time you set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps. You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see Image Building and Management. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 有关系统组的详细信息，请参见 系统组。 During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see 使用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 进行监视. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible Integration. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server ; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server ; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly.

Synchronize Images to the Branch Server To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server containerized proxy one or more Uyuni build hosts network stack depending on selected network architecture, see Network Architecture This section covers how to configure your Uyuni for Retail environment, including: Prepare POS images Prepare system groups for Saltboot Configure services for Saltboot The very first time you set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps in order. You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server group, you will need to have images prepared already. If you are configuring more than one branch server, the same images are reused across different branch server groups. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. For information about Uyuni image building, see Image Building and Management. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. POS image templates and resulting images do not set a system user password. You will not be able to login as a system user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template without customization. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user password. You can use Salt to set up a system user password after the terminal has been deployed. After POS image is successfully built and inspected by Uyuni, you can validate that POS boot image was correctly registered by following procedure. Procedure Validate POS boot image On Uyuni command line execute following command: mgrctl exec cobbler distro list Your POS image should be listed with organization number before image name For every branch server choose branch id. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 有关系统组的详细信息，请参见 系统组。 During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. In case you plan to use the branch server container host as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see 使用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 进行监视. In case you plan to use the branch server container host with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible Integration. Before configuring Saltboot group, make sure you already have at least one POS image available. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured using so called Saltboot Group. Saltboot Group is a branch groups, system group with branch id as its name created in previous step, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula previously used in Uyuni for Retail setups. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"grub/shim.efi\"; next-server ; } else { filename \"pxelinux.0\"; next-server ; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Uyuni for Retail branch proxy uses different filename then previous non-containerized branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires instructions how to partitioning terminal harddisk and what image to deploy. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types and partitioning, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Uyuni for Retail 2024.07 no longer need manual image synchronization, all images are available to all clients automatically. This may not be always desired, for example to allow images gradual deployments across all branches. For a way how to limit image deployment, see Best practices.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Mass Configuration 1.1. Configure Multiple Branch Servers 2. Terminal Mass Configuration 2.1. Configure Multiple Terminals 3. Export Configuration to Mass Configuration File Mass configuration is possible with branch servers and terminals. Mass configuration tool was not yet adapted for containerized saltboot workflow. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Network Configuration 1.1. Shared Network Architecture 1.2. Externally Managed Dedicated Network Architecture 1.3. Dedicated Network Architecture (using 4.3 branch server) Uyuni for Retail uses a layered architecture: The first layer contains the Uyuni Server. The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services. It also contains one or more build hosts. The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see 在 openSUSE Leap 中安装 Uyuni Proxy. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements. The branch server and the terminals are connected to the same network as the Uyuni Server. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network. The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides proxy, PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network. The branch servers are in the same network as the Uyuni Server, and terminals use an isolated branch network. In this configuration, the branch servers are in the corporate network, and provide all DHCP, DNS, PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in the branch networks.","title":"Network Architecture","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-network-arch","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-network-arch.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Cached Terminal Updates If the Uyuni Server is offline, you can still perform some operations on the terminals. This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded. When the terminal is rebooted and an uptodate POS image is found in the service partition, the terminal will automatically use this cached image for system redeployment.","title":"Offline Use","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-offline","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-offline.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

As Key Label fill in saltboot_force_repartition. As Description fill in Force terminal disk repartition. Click Create Key. Creating saltboot_force_repartition custom key is one time operation. Once created, it is available for repeated use. Procedure: Assign custom value for disk repartitioning Navigate to the Overview page of the system you want to redeploy. Select tab Custom Info. Click on Create Value. From the list of available keys click saltboot_force_repartition. As Value type True. Click Update Key. Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. An API call system.setPillar can be used to set specific Saltboot options through Salt pillar data. Uyuni Saltboot integration is using tuning-saltboot pillar category to manage Saltboot tuning, including forced redeployment or disk repartition. Using this pillar category allows Uyuni to reset Saltboot flag once the terminal is booted up. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image using API call using spacecmd command In the console run following the command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_redeployment\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to repartition disk using API call using spacecmd command In the console run the following command, replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_repartition\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Check Saltboot tuning options In the console run the following command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot' system.getPillar Make sure to use tuning-saltboot as pillar category in the API call. Pillars specified outside of Uyuni database cannot be reset automatically. Without manual intervention, the terminal will download a new image on each reboot. Procedure: Force a Saltboot to redeploy image using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_redeploy.sls with content: saltboot: force_redeploy: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_redeploy Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After the terminal finishes booting, remove modifications made in /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls file. If your terminal encounters a problem with the file system or the partition table, you might need to remove the partition table and reformat the terminal. Procedure: Force Saltboot to repartition disk using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_repartition.sls with content: saltboot: force_repartition: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_repartition Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes.

Naming by FQDN 4. Assign Hostnames to Terminals Terminals can be named according to certain parameters, which can make it easier to match the physical device with its record in the Uyuni Web UI. Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, and HWType. Naming scheme can be selected in the Branch Network formula. For more information, see Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID 例如： B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID 例如： B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 例如： B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: hwAddress: hwtype: Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name.

For proxy installation procedures, see 在 openSUSE Leap 中安装 Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni Proxy 设置. Then continue with the following sections. Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. 此过程所需的产品包括： Table 1. openSUSE 通道 - CLI OS Version openSUSE Leap 15.4 Base Channel opensuse_leap15_4 Client Channel opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-updates Non-OSS Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss Non-OSS Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates Backports Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates SLE Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates 过程：在命令提示符处添加软件通道 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符下，以 root 身份使用 spacewalk-common-channels 命令添加相应的通道： spacewalk-common-channels \\ \\ \\ \\ ... 同步通道： mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels 过程：检查同步进度 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与储存库关联的通道。 导航到储存库选项卡，然后单击同步并选中同步状态。 过程：在命令提示符处检查同步进度 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，以 root 身份使用 tail 命令检查同步日志文件： tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE 通道可能会非常大。同步所需的时间可能会长达数小时。 By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. 过程：在客户端上信任 GPG 密钥 On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key If you are bootstrapping clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) 有关创建激活密钥的详细信息，请参见 激活密钥。 You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。 A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see Uyuni Proxy 注册. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. For more information about the proxy setup script, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc#uyuni-proxy-setup-confproxy[]. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types. Configure the proxy to become a branch server. On the Uyuni for Retail Server, for example, run: retail_branch_init --dedicated-nic eth1 \\ --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \\ --netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \\ --server-domain branch.example.org \\ --branch-prefix uyuni For additional options, use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.","title":"Retail Uyuni Branch Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-uyuni-branchserver","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-uyuni-branchserver.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":1},{"text":"2. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":2},{"text":"3. 在客户端上信任 GPG 密钥","hash":"_在客户端上信任_gpg_密钥","id":3},{"text":"4.

To accomplish this, Cobbler uses a list of proxies specified in /etc/cobbler/settings. Due to its design, cobbler sync is not able to sync only the changed or recently added files. Instead, executing cobbler sync triggers a full sync of the /srv/tftpboot directory to all specified proxies configured in /etc/cobbler/settings. It is also influenced by the latency of the WAN connection between the involved systems. 根据 /var/log/cobbler/ 中的日志，同步过程可能需要很长时间才能完成。 例如，该过程开始时间为： Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running python triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/pre/* 结束时间为： Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | running shell triggers from /var/lib/cobbler/triggers/task/sync/post/* Thu Jun 3 15:18:49 2021 - DEBUG | shell triggers finished successfully 传输量大约为 1.8 GB。传输花费了将近 30 分钟。 相比之下，复制一个与 /srv/tftboot 大小相同的大文件只需几分钟即可完成。 改用基于 rsync 的方法在 Uyuni Server 与 Proxy 之间复制文件可能有助于减少传输量和等待时间。 可以从 https://suse.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/1i000000gLOd/a/1i000000ll5B/B2AmvIJN2_JsAyjTQzCVP_x5ioVgd0bYN9X9NpMugS8 下载用于完成此任务的脚本。 该脚本不接受命令行选项。在运行该脚本之前，您需要手动编辑它并正确设置 SUMAHOSTNAME、SUMAIP 和 SUMAPROXY1 变量，使其能够正常运行。 不支持调整该脚本的个别设置。该脚本及其包含的注释旨在提供传输过程以及要考虑的步骤的概述。如需进一步的帮助，请联系 SUSE 咨询部门。 对于以下情况，最好使用建议的脚本用法： SUSE Manager Proxy 系统是通过 WAN 连接的； /srv/tftboot 包含大量发行套件文件和客户端 PXE 引导文件，总共有数千个文件； Any proxy in /etc/cobbler/settings has been disabled, otherwise Uyuni will continue to sync content to the proxies. #proxies: # - \"sumaproxy.sumaproxy.test\" # - \"sumaproxy2.sumaproxy.test\" 过程：分析新的同步速度 为 Uyuni 与相关系统之间的 TCP 流量创建转储。 在 SUSE Manager Server 上： tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh 在 SUSE Manager Proxy 上： tcpdump -i ethX -s 200 host and not ssh 这样就只会捕获大小为 200 的软件包，但足以运行分析。 将 ethX 调整为由 Uyuni 用来与代理通讯的相应网络接口。 最后，不会捕获 ssh 通讯，从而进一步减少了软件包的数量。 Start a cobbler sync. To force a sync, delete the Cobbler json cache file first and then issue cobbler sync: rm /var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json cobbler sync When {command]cobbler sync is finished, stop the TCPdumps. 使用 Wireshark 打开 TCPdumps，转到 Statistics（统计信息）> Conversations（对话），并等待分析转储。 切换到“TCP”选项卡。此选项卡上显示的数字是在 SUSE Manager 与 SUSE Manager Proxy 之间捕获的对话总数。 找到列 Duration（持续时间）。 首先按升序排序，找出传输文件所花费的最短时间。 继续按降序排序，找出大文件传输时间的最大值，例如内核和 initrd 传输。 忽略端口 4505 和 4506，因为它们用于 Salt 通讯。 TCPdumps 分析结果表明，将大小约为 1800 字节的小文件从 Uyuni Server 传输到 Proxy 大约花费了 0.3 秒。 此处的大文件不多，而大量的小文件导致建立了大量连接，因为每传输一个文件就要创建新的 TCP 连接。 因此，在知道最短传输时间和所需连接数（在本示例中大约为 5000）的情况下，可以大致估算出总传输时间：5000 * 0.3 / 60 = 25 分钟。","title":"对通过 WAN 连接在 Uyuni Server 与 Proxy 之间同步时间过长的问题进行查错","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan","url":"/uyuni/administration/troubleshooting/tshoot-highsynctimesoverwan.html","titles":[]},"246":{"id":246,"text":"如果您在本地更改了 Uyuni Server 的主机名，Uyuni 安装将无法正常进行。这是因为尚未在数据库中做出相应更改，因而这些更改无法从您的客户端和任何代理传播出来。 如果您需要更改 Uyuni 服务器的主机名，可以使用 spacewalk-hostname-rename 脚本来更改。此脚本会更新 PostgreSQL 数据库以及 Uyuni 的内部结构中的设置。 spacewalk-hostname-rename 脚本是 spacewalk-utils 软件包的一部分。 该脚本的唯一必需参数是为 Uyuni Server 新配置的 IP 地址。 过程：重命名 Uyuni Server 在 DNS 服务器上，本地和远程更改系统级别的服务器的网络设置。 您还需要提供用于反向名称解析的配置设置。更改网络设置的方式与重命名任何其他系统的方式相同。 重引导 Uyuni Server 以使用新网络配置并确保主机名更改。 结合服务器的公共 IP 地址运行脚本 spacewalk-hostname-rename。 如果服务器未使用新主机名，则该脚本会失败。请注意，此脚本会刷新所有 Salt 客户端的 pillar 数据：运行时间取决于注册的客户端数量。 如果通过 Uyuni 代理管理客户端，请跳过此步骤。 重新配置直接管理的客户端，确保它们知道新主机名和 IP 地址。 在 Salt 客户端配置文件中，必须指定新 Salt 主控端（Uyuni 服务器）的名称（文件名为 /etc/venv-salt-bundle/minion，如果您未使用 Salt 捆绑包，则为 /etc/salt/minion）： master: 重启动 venv-salt-minion 服务（如果使用 Salt 捆绑包）： systemctl restart venv-salt-minion 或 salt-minion 服务（如果未使用 Salt 捆绑包）： systemctl restart salt-minion 要将主机名完全传播到 Salt 客户端配置，请应用 Highstate。应用 Highstate 会更新储存库 URL 中的主机名。 Any proxy must be reconfigured.

Limit Container Capabilities 9. Secure Host Environment 10. Implement Runtime Protection Hardening a container involves implementing security measures to reduce its attack surface and enhance its resilience against potential threats. In this section we have listed techinques commonly used to harden containers. This list is not comprehensive and container security will depend on your oranization’s infrastructure. For more information, see Security and Hardening Guide. Uyuni 2024.07 uses SLE Micro 5.5 as its base. This image has fewer pre-installed packages, thus reducing the potential attack surface. Reduced Size Minimal base images are significantly smaller in size compared to classical operating system images. By removing unnecessary packages and libraries, these images minimize the overall footprint, leading to faster download times and reduced storage requirements. Focused Functionality Minimal base images are designed to provide the essential functionalities needed for running containerized applications. Minimal base images typically include: core system utilities runtime environments (such as the shell) essential libraries Minimal base images typically exclude non-essential components such as: 文档 development tools unnecessary daemons Improved Security By minimizing the number of installed packages and dependencies, minimal base images reduce the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities within the container environment. This enhances security by limiting the avenues through which malicious actors can exploit the system. Flexibility Minimal base images offer greater flexibility for developers to customize and optimize their containerized applications. Since these images contain only the basic necessities, developers have more control over which additional components and dependencies to include, tailoring the container environment to meet specific application requirements. Keep container images up to date with security patches and updates. Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like: Trivy Project Quay Skopeo Use digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of container images. Implement image signing and verification mechanisms to ensure that only trusted images are deployed. Digital Signatures A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to validate the authenticity and integrity of digital content, such as container images. It involves generating a unique hash or checksum of the image content and encrypting it with a private key to produce a signature. This signature can be decrypted using a corresponding public key to verify its authenticity. Private and Public Keys Image signing relies on asymmetric encryption, which involves the use of a pair of cryptographic keys: a private key and a public key. The private key is used to generate the signature, while the public key is used to verify the signature. The private key is kept confidential and securely stored, while the public key can be freely distributed. Trust Model Image signing establishes a trust model where the signer of the image is implicitly trusted to vouch for its authenticity. Organizations typically maintain their own private key for signing images, and users trust images signed by that organization’s key. Image consumers can verify the signature using the corresponding public key to ensure that the image has not been compromised or altered by malicious actors. Registry Integration Image signing is often integrated with container image registries, such as Docker Hub or private registries like Harbor. Registries may offer built-in support for image signing, allowing users to sign and verify images directly within the registry platform. Signed images are typically tagged with metadata indicating their signed status and the identity of the signer. Verification Process Before deploying a container image, the image consumer (for example, a container runtime or orchestration platform) verifies the image signature using the signer’s public key. If the signature is valid and matches the image content, the image is considered authentic and can be safely deployed. If the signature cannot be verified or does not match the image content, the image is rejected to prevent potential security risks. Run containers with the least privilege principle. Avoid running containers as root whenever possible. Instead, create, and use non-root users within containers to limit the impact of potential exploits. Leverage security features provided by container runtimes such as Podman. Configure security contexts to enforce resource limitations, network policies, and SELinux/AppArmor profiles. Implement network segmentation to isolate containers from each other and from the host system. Use container network plugins or overlay networks to enforce network policies and restrict container communications. Employ container runtime monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time. Monitor container logs, file integrity, and system calls for signs of compromise or malicious behavior. Disable unnecessary Linux capabilities within containers to reduce the potential impact of privilege escalation attacks. Use tools like capsh to drop or restrict capabilities as needed. Ensure that the underlying host system is properly secured. Apply operating system patches, configure firewall rules, and implement access controls to protect the host from external threats. Use runtime protection mechanisms such as seccomp or AppArmor profiles to restrict the actions that container processes can perform. Define and enforce granular security policies to prevent unauthorized access or execution of malicious code.","title":"Hardening and Improving Container Security","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"container-security","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-management/container-security.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_5 \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see 注册 openSUSE Leap 客户端. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see 注册 openSUSE Leap 客户端. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL 证书. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

Fill in the account information fields, including an email for system notifications. Click Create Organization to finish creating your administration account. When you have completed the Uyuni Web UI setup, you are taken to the Home Overview page. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab.

Setup spacecmd Credentials 2. spacecmd Quiet Mode 3. spacecmd Help To access a shell inside the Server container, run mgrctl term on the container host. From there, one can run the CLI tools as usual. The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help ): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This will result in the following kernel option being written: install=http://localhost/ks/dist/ Resolution Set the FQDN in $HOME/.spacecmd/config like the following: test:~/.spacecmd # cat config [spacecmd] server=test.mytest.env username=admin password=password nossl=0 Cause This problem may be experienced if $HOME/.spacecmd/config has been created and the server name option was set to localhost. When running spacecmd non-interactively: you must escape arguments passed to the command. always put -- before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments. make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted. An example of a well-formed spacecmd command: spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \\'My Channel\\' -l channel1 -a x86_64 The spacecmd command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block//queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block//queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"460":{"id":460,"text":"Make sure the hub-xmlrpc-api service is started: systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api Once it is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Authentication Examples The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different authentication modes: Manual mode (default): API credentials must be explicitly provided for each server. Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2.

However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"465":{"id":465,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Tuning Reporting Jobs 4.2. report_db_batch_size 4.3. report_db_hub_workers The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral Uyuni Servers. The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Navigate to Help Report Database Schema to find the schema documentation. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Client Onboarding Rate 2. Clients and the RNG 3. Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys 4. Disabling the Salt Mine 5. Disable Unnecessary Taskomatic Jobs 6. Swap and Monitoring 7. AES Key Rotation This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments. Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt Mine to check client availability. The Salt Mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. Since the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt Mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered clients will have the Salt Mine disabled by default. If the Salt Mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt Mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. There is no hard maximum number of supported systems. Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured. There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information see Install Uyuni Proxy from Packages. Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use Uyuni for Retail to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals. There is an introduction to Uyuni for Retail in this book. Tuning and monitoring large scale deployments can differ from smaller installations.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

Memory Usage Uyuni is designed by default to work on small and medium scale installations. For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters. Description The maximum number of HTTP requests served simultaneously by Apache httpd. Proxies, Web UI, and XMLRPC API clients each consume one. Requests exceeding the parameter will be queued and might result in timeouts.

Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. Notes Incoming Salt events are handled in separate thread pool, see java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum number of minions concurrently executing a scheduled action. Tune when Client count reaches several thousands and actions are not executed quickly enough.

Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information Salt Rate Limiting Description The maximum number of threads in Tomcat dedicated to handling of incoming Salt events. Tune when The number of queued Salt events grows. Typically, this can happen during onboarding of large number of minions with higher value of java.salt_presence_ping_timeout. The number of events can be queried by echo \"select count(*) from susesaltevent;\" | spacewalk-sql --select-mode-direct - Value default 8 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_event_thread_pool_size = 50 After changing Check the length of Salt event queue. Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size, as each thread consumes a PostgreSQL connection, starvation might happen if the allocated connection pool is insufficient. Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. More information man rhn.conf Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. This parameter sets the amount of time before a second command (find_job) is sent to the client to verify its presence. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 4 seconds Value recommendation 4-400 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_timeout = 40 After changing Large java.salt_presence_ping_timeout value can reduce overall throughput. This can be compensated by increasing java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information Salt Timeouts Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. After java.salt_presence_ping_timeout seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (find_job) is sent to the client for a final check. This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered offline. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 1 second Value recommendation 1-100 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 10 More information Salt Timeouts Description Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it. Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count increases significantly (more than 50), or more concurrent operations on channels are expected. Value default 2 Value recommendation 2-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers = 4 After changing Check taskomatic.java.maxmemory for adjustment, as every new thread will consume memory More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum amount of memory Taskomatic can use. Generation of metadata, especially for some OSs, can be memory-intensive, so this parameter might need raising depending on the managed OS mix. Tune when java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers increases, OSs are added to Uyuni (particularly Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu), or OutOfMemoryException errors appear in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log.

If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving. Value default 20 Value recommendation 100 to 200, higher than the maximum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size + maxThreads and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example hibernate.c3p0.max_size = 100 After changing Check max_connections for adjustment. More information https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize Description The maximum amount of memory that the rhn-search service can use. Tune when Client count increases significantly, and OutOfMemoryException errors appear in journalctl -u rhn-search. Value default 512 MiB Value recommendation 512-4096 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example rhn-search.java.maxmemory = 4096 After changing Check memory usage. Description The amount of memory reserved for PostgreSQL shared buffers, which contain caches of database tables and index data. Tune when RAM changes Value default 25% of total RAM Value recommendation 25-40% of total RAM Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example shared_buffers = 8192MB After changing Check memory usage. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation Depends on other settings, use /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/susemanager-connection-check to obtain a recommendation. Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-200 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 50 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel.

Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Public Cloud Guide For more information on cloud products and support, see the SUSE public cloud guide: SUSE Public Cloud Guide Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) The Public Cloud Information Tracker (PINT) provides information about the images SUSE publishes and servers that are part of the SUSE operated update infrastructure. PINT is available at pint.suse.com and provided as an API and command-line tool with the python3-susepubliccloudinfo package from the Public Cloud Module repository. To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command supportconfig. The command-line tool is provided by the package supportutils which is installed by default. Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate supportconfig plug-ins. When supportconfig is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. supportconfig plug-ins are stored in directory /usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/. The following procedure shows how to create a Supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly. Procedure: Creating a Supportconfig Archive Run supportconfig as root. Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list: Listing 1. Options: -E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E) Company name (-O) Your name (-N) Your phone number (-P) -i KEYWORDS, -F Limits the features to check. The placeholder KEYWORDS is a comma-separated list of case-sensitive keywords. Get a list of all keywords with supportconfig -F. Wait for the tool to complete the operation. The default archive location is /var/log, with the file name format being scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz To open a new support case for your cloud Pay-as-you-go instance, you need to generate a supportconfig file and then follow the steps listed on: SUSE Customer Center Cloudsupport This service serves billing data from Uyuni for the CSP-billing-adapter.

Enable and Configure the HANA Formula 2. Enable and Configure the Cluster Formula Uyuni uses formulas with forms to configure your SAP clients. There are two formulas that you need to use: Hana to configure the HANA database Cluster to configure the clients into a cluster The formulas are provided by packages that you can download with your package manager. You need to install the formulas on the Uyuni Server. When you have installed the package, you can use the Uyuni Web UI to enable and configure the formulas. As you go through the formula configuration process, provide details of the clients that contain your SAP cluster, to set them up appropriately. To install the formulas on the Uyuni Server, use your package manager to install these packages: saphanabootstrap-formula sapnwbootstrap-formula drbd-formula habootstrap-formula salt-shaptools The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important. You must enable, configure, and apply the HANA formula first. Then you can enable, configure, and apply the cluster formula. If you perform these steps in the wrong order, your SAP installation fails. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List and click the client to use as the primary client in the cluster. Navigate to the Formulas tab, locate the Sap Hana Deployment heading, and check the Saphanabootstrap formula in the list. Click Save and apply the highstate to activate the formula. When the formula is activated, navigate to the Formulas Hana tab, and complete the details in the form. Make sure you check Install required packages to install everything you need on the client.

Register Clients to the SUSE Customer Center 2. Configure the Clients for Clustering 3. Create a Shared Storage Device 4. Download the SAP Installation Software 5. Configure Clients to Use Latest module.run 6. Install Additional Disks for HANA 7. Register Clients to the Server Your SAP cluster requires several client systems. Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP4/html/SLES-SAP-installation/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 一般要求. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. In the Activation Key field, select the SLES for SAP activation key.

Custom State to Trust a GPG Key 4. Apply a custom state at highstate You can create your own custom Salt states with Uyuni as centrally managed configuration channels. Custom states are stored as Salt state files on the Uyuni Server with a .sls extension. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create and edit custom Salt state files. You must create a state channel first, with an initial state named init.sls. The init.sls file is used to reference all other state files within the channel. The custom states that you create using the Web UI are stored on the Uyuni Server in the the /srv/susemanager/salt// directory. After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state. If you want to reference file templates in this configuration channel, ensure your file starts by specifying the source of the managed file, using this syntax: file.managed: - source: salt:////etc// Example custom state files are given later in this section. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. Procedure: Adding Additional Files to a Custom State Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. . Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click btn:Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit .sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2. Example: Package Management my_pkg_id: pkg.installed: - refresh: True - pkgs: - glibc - kernel-default - hello: 1.0-42 Listing 3. Example: Remote Command ip_forward-on: cmd.run: - name: echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - onlyif: - test `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 Listing 4. Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all user public files must be saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey- deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls.

This section describes how Salt is supported and set up as part of Uyuni Server. The main configuration file is /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf. Do not edit the /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf configuration file. This file belongs to the spacewalk-setup package and is marked as %config. When SUSE updates the spacewalk-setup package, the susemanager.conf file is overwritten, and any customization is lost. Instead, add your own configuration file to the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This prevents the update process from deleting your settings from the main susemanager.conf configuration file. Some settings from /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf that can help with finding configuration options: # Configure different file roots.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of Saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders. In the Configured Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.com). In the Type field, select master. Click Add item to add a second zone, and set these parameters for Zone 2: In the Name field, use the reverse zone for the configured IP range (for example: com.example.branch1). In the Type field, select master In the Available Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.org). In the File field, type the name of your configuration file. In the Start of Authority (SOA) section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Nameserver (NS) field, use the FQDN of the branch server (for example: branchserver.branch1.example.org). In the Contact field, use the email address for the domain administrator. Keep all other fields as their default values. In the Records section, in subsection A, use these parameters to set up an A record for Zone 1: In the Hostname field, use the hostname of the branch server (for example: branchserver). In the IP field, use the IP address of the branch server (for example, 192.168.1.5). In the Records section, subsection NS, use these parameters to set up an NS record for Zone 1: In the input box, use the hostname of the branch server (for example: branchserver). In the Records section, subsection CNAME, use these parameters to set up CNAME records for Zone 1: In the Key field, enter tftp, and in the Value field, type the hostname of the branch server (for example: branchserver).

Set Up a Branch Server Networking 1.1. Set Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN 1.2. Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network 2. Set up Branch Server Terminal Naming The Branch Network formula is used to configure the networking services required by the branch server, including DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP. The formula is used only for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3. with Uyuni Server 5.0. Do not use this formula if you want to connect Uyuni Proxy 5.0. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration it is required to fill at least Branch Identification. This identifies Branch Server in Retail subsystem and is also used to better organize terminals with their respective branch servers.

Do not use this parameter in a production environment as it creates a major security hole. This parameter should be used only in a development environment for debug purposes. MASTER Overrides auto-detection of the Salt master. For example: MASTER=myproxy.domain.com SALT_TIMEOUT Overrides the local boot fallback timeout if the Salt master does not apply the Saltboot state within this timeout (default: 60 seconds). For example: SALT_TIMEOUT=300 DISABLE_HOSTNAME_ID If the terminal has a hostname assigned by DHCP, it is by default used as a minion ID. Setting this option to 1 disables this mechanism, and SMBios information will be used as a minion ID. DISABLE_UNIQUE_SUFFIX Setting this option to 1 disables adding random generated suffix to terminal minion ID. If you set this parameter make sure your terminal has either a unique hostname provided by DHCP and DNS, or the terminal hardware comes with a unique serial number stored in its SMBios memory. Otherwise there is a risk of terminal minion ID duplicity, and bootstrapping the minion will fail. The following parameters (MINION_ID_PREFIX, salt_device, root) are usually autoconfigured and should be used only in specific conditions such as debugging or development: MINION_ID_PREFIX Branch ID set in the Branch Network formula form. salt_device Device that contains the Salt configuration. root Device that contains the already deployed root file system. Used for falling back to local boot.","title":"PXE Formula","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formula-pxe","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formula-pxe.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Saltboot formula helps you with setting up special partition types. For terminal to be able to boot locally, either BIOS grub or EFI partition must be configured. A BIOS grub partition is needed for local booting from a GPT disk on non-EFI machines. For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_boot_partition. In the formula, enter the following options: Partition Symbolic ID: p1 Partition Size (MiB): 50 Partition Flags: bios_grub Leave the other fields empty. An EFI partition is needed for local booting on EFI machines, Partition Table Type must be GPT. For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition. In the formula, enter the following options: Partition Symbolic ID: p1 Partition Size (MiB): 500 Device Mount Point: /boot/efi Filesystem Format: vfat Partition Flags: boot Leave the other fields empty. When there is only one disk present on target hardware (including USB drives), use an asterisk * to automatically select the disk device. When there are multiple disks, use an asterisk * in the device path. In this example, SATA disks are differentiated from USB disks: /dev/disk/by-path/*-ata-1 /dev/disk/by-path/*usb* If the entered value does not contain /, the entered value is automatically prepended by /dev/disk/by-path/. For example, *usb* is the same as /dev/disk/by-path/*usb*. If you prefer to select specific devices, you can this format in the disk device field: symbolic names (for example: /dev/sda) by-path (for example: /dev/disk/by-path/..) by-id (for example: /dev/disk/by-id/…​) To see a list of available devices from the command prompt, press Esc while waiting for key approval. msdos Disklabel Limitations On the msdos disk label, you can create a maximum of four primary partitions. Extended partitions are not supported. If you need more than four partitions, use the GPT disk label instead.","title":"Saltboot Formula","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formula-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formula-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Expression language 3. Writing Salt Formulas 4. Separate Data 5. Generated Pillar Data This section contains information about writing custom formulas, including formulas with forms. You can write your own custom formulas, and make them available to client systems in the Uyuni Web UI. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directory also contains an optional metadata.yml file with additional information about the formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt// Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata// All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata//form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a : null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1.

Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py The process is executed like this: The suma_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (suma_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Batching 2. Disabling the Salt Mine Salt is able to run commands in parallel on a large number of clients. This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.

Repository Access with a Proxy 11. Proxy Setup 12. Rotate SSH keys Salt SSH allows Salt commands and states to be issued directly over SSH. SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://suma-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the suma-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost suma-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to suma-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:suma-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to suma-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file= minion state.apply certs,` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time. The SSH key is used on salt-ssh managed systems. Additionally, it is used on Uyuni Proxies for the user mgrsshtunnel. Normal systems managed with the Salt default method are not affected and do not have this key configured. Procedure: Rotating SSH keys On the Uyuni Server, as user root, change to user salt: su -s /bin/bash - salt Create a new SSH key: ssh-keygen -N \"\" -t rsa -q -f /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id Copy the public key into the Salt filesystem to make it usable in a Salt state: cp /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id.pub /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ Change back to user root again: exit Rollout the new key to all systems that need it. Applying the util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key state will limit the changes to salt-ssh managed systems and proxies: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key Move the old key away and make the new key the standard key. Rename mgr_ssh_id key to disabled_mgr_ssh_id and new_mgr_ssh_id key to mgr_ssh_id in the SSH keystore of the user salt as well as in the Salt filesystem for the public keys: su -s /bin/bash - salt cd .ssh mv mgr_ssh_id disabled_mgr_ssh_id mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id mgr_ssh_id mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub cd /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub OPTIONAL: When containerized proxies exist, re-create the configuration to get the new SSH key into the proxy configuration. Restart the containers with the new configuration. It is also possible to change the existing configuration on the podman host (ssh.yaml). Change the value of server_ssh_key_pub with the content of the current mgr_ssh_id.pub. To remove the disabled keys from the authorized_keys` files of the [literal]salt-ssh`` managed systems and the proxies, apply the state a second time: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Download Endpoint States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see 自定义系统信息. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. If you change pillar data on the server (Salt master) the actual pillar data on the client (minion) is updated only after calling saltutil.refresh_pillar for the client. Otherwise it could happen that pillar.items and pillar.get calls would produce different results with different values of pillars that were not refreshed. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring. When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor. To use beacons on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Salt clients, install the python-pyinotify package. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, install the python-inotify package. For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are sometimes referred to as Salt clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step. For more information on states, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html.

General Salt timeouts 2. Presence Ping Timeouts 3. Salt SSH Clients (SSH Push) Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (presence_ping_timeout/presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here.

Install the Yomi Formula 2. Install the PXE Image 3. Register Yomi in Cobbler 4. Example Salt Pillar Preparation 5. Monitor the Installation Yomi (yet one more installer) is an installer for SUSE and openSUSE operating systems. Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp:///pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

At the JeOS Firstboot screen select start to continue. Select keyboard layout. Accept the license agreement. Select your time zone. Enter a password for root. Once installation completes login as root. Proceed to the next section. Procedure: Registering SL Micro and Uyuni 2024.07 Proxy Boot the virtual machine. 以 root 身份登录。 Register SL Micro with SCC. transactional-update register -r -e 重引导。 Register Uyuni 2024.07 with SUSE Customer Center. transactional-update register -p SUSE-Manager-Proxy/5.0/x86_64 -r 重引导。 Update the system: transactional-update If updates were applied reboot. On the Uyuni server, create an activation key for the Proxy. Task: Create an Activation Key Navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create key. Create an activation key for the proxy host with SL Micro 5.5 as the parent channel. This key should include all recommended channels and the Proxy as an extension child channel. Proceed to boostrapping the proxy host as a minion. Task: Bootstrap the Proxy Host Select Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the fields for your proxy host. Select the Activation key created in the previous step from the dropdown. Click Bootstrap. Wait for the Bootstrap process to complete successfully. Check the Salt menu and confirm the Salt key is listed and accepted. Reboot the proxy host. Select the host from the System list and trigger a second reboot after all events are finished to conclude the onboarding. Task: Update the Proxy Host Select the host from the Systems list and apply all patches to update it. Reboot the proxy host. The configuration archive of the Uyuni Proxy is generated by the Uyuni Server. Each additional proxy requires its own configuration archive. The container host for the Uyuni Proxy must be registered as client to the Uyuni Server prior to generating this proxy configuration. You will perform the following tasks: Generate a Proxy configuration file. Transfer the configuration to the Proxy. Start the Proxy with the mgrpxy command. Procedure: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration using Web UI 在 Web UI 中，导航到系统 代理配置，然后填写所需数据： 在代理 FQDN字段中，键入代理的完全限定域名。 在父 FQDN字段中，键入 Uyuni 服务器或另一个 Uyuni 代理的完全限定域名。 在代理 SSH 端口字段中，键入 SSH 服务在 Uyuni 代理上监听的 SSH 端口。建议保留默认值 8022。 在最大 Squid 缓存大小 [MB]字段中，键入允许的最大 Squid 缓存大小。一般该值最多应为容器可用存储空间的 60 %。 在 SSH 证书选择列表中，选择应为 Uyuni 代理生成新服务器证书还是使用现有证书。您可以考虑作为 Uyuni 内置（自我签名）证书生成的证书。 然后根据所做的选择提供用于生成新证书的签名 CA 证书的路径，或者要用作代理证书的现有证书及其密钥的路径。 The CA certificates generated on the server are stored in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/ssl-build directory. 有关现有或自定义证书的详细信息以及企业和中间证书的概念，请参见 导入 SSL 证书。 单击 生成 以在 Uyuni 服务器中注册新代理 FQDN，并生成包含容器主机细节的配置存档。 片刻之后，系统会显示文件可供下载。请将此文件保存在本地。 The Web UI generates a configuration archive. This archive needs to be made available on the proxy container host. Procedure: Copying the Proxy Configuration Copy the files from the Server container to the Server host OS: mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz . Next copy the files from the Server host OS to the Proxy host: scp config.tar.gz :/root Install the Proxy with: mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz Container can now be started with the mgrpxy command: Procedure: Start and Check Proxy Status Start the Proxy by calling: mgrpxy start Check container status by calling: mgrpxy status 应该会显示五个 Uyuni Proxy 容器： proxy-salt-broker proxy-httpd proxy-tftpd proxy-squid proxy-ssh And should be part of the proxy-pod container pod. By default, the Uyuni Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services. However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with -tag and -image. 例如，可以按如下方式使用此命令： mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds is the image to use and 0.1.0 is the version tag, before restarting it. To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters: mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.","title":"Deploy Uyuni 2024.07 Proxy as a Virtual Machine","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"proxy-deployment-vm-suma","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/suma/proxy-deployment-vm-suma.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Migrating To migrate a regular Uyuni server to a container, a new machine is required. It is not possible to perform an in-place migration. The original server is referred to as the source server, while the newly set-up machine is designated as the destination server. The migration procedure currently does not include any hostname renaming functionality. Consequently, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the new server will remain identical to that on the source server. Therefore, following migration, it will be necessary to manually adjust the DNS records to point to the new server. Procedure: Initial preparation Stop the source server: spacewalk-service stop Stop the source services: systemctl stop postgresql Procedure: Preparing the SSH connection The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the host for a passwordless connection to the source server. To establish a passwordless connection, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the server. If one isn’t active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then, add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add /path/to/the/private/key. You’ll be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. The migration script only uses the source server fully qualified domain name in the SSH command. This means that every other configuration required to connect needs to be defined in the ~/.ssh/config file. Before executing the migration command with mgradm migrate, it’s essential to predefine Persistent Volumes, especially considering that the migration job initiates the container from scratch. Please consult the installation section for comprehensive guidance on preparing these volumes. See: Persistent container volumes Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server, replacing with the appropriate FQDN of the source server: mgradm migrate podman 或 mgradm migrate kubernetes After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the old server (source server). To redirect them to the new server (destination server), it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same Fully Qualified Domain Name and IP address as old server (source server).","title":"Migrating  the Uyuni server to a containerized environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"migrate-uyuni-to-a-container","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/migrate-uyuni-to-a-container.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For more information about registering client to the Uyuni Server, see 客户端注册. Uyuni Proxy 容器使用 podman 和 systemd 运行和管理所有代理容器。 First step is to install the mgrpxy utility provided by the package of the same name. The mgrpxy package is available in the container utils repository: pick the one matching the distribution in: https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/. To install them run: zypper in helm mgrpxy Procedure: Installation of container utility tool mgrpxy for Uyuni Proxy 在 Uyuni 中为容器主机指派 Containers Module 软件通道。有关为系统指派软件通道的详细信息，请参见 通道管理。 在容器主机上以 root 身份登录。 Manually install mgrpxy package: zypper install mgrpxy Uyuni Proxy 容器需要挂载一些卷来长期存储数据。podman 会自动创建这些卷，您可以使用 podman volume ls 命令列出它们。默认情况下，podman 会将卷文件存储在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes 中。卷的命名方式如下： uyuni-proxy-squid-cache uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache uyuni-proxy-tftpboot 要覆盖默认卷设置，请在 Pod 首次启动前使用 podman volume create 命令创建卷。 By default, the uyuni-proxy-systemd-services package creates these three directories that can be used to mount external disks: /var/lib/uyuni/proxy-rhn-cache /var/lib/uyuni/proxy-squid-cache /var/lib/uyuni/proxy-tftpboot If /etc/fstab has these entries: /dev/uyuni-proxy/rhn-cache /var/lib/uyuni/proxy-rhn-cache xfs defaults 0 0 /dev/uyuni-proxy/squid-cache /var/lib/uyuni/proxy-squid-cache xfs defaults 0 0 /dev/uyuni-proxy/tftpboot /var/lib/uyuni/proxy-tftpboot xfs defaults 0 0 Run these commands to create custom volumes: podman volume create --driver local --opt device=/dev/mapper/uyuni--proxy-rhn--cache --opt type=xfs uyuni-proxy-rhn-cache podman volume create --driver local --opt device=/dev/mapper/uyuni--proxy-squid--cache --opt type=xfs uyuni-proxy-squid-cache podman volume create --driver local --opt device=/dev/mapper/uyuni--proxy-tftpboot --opt type=xfs uyuni-proxy-tftpboot To install the systemd service starting the Uyuni proxy, run the mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz command. It is possible to add custom arguments passed to podman container pod with the one or more --podman-arg parameters to the install command. It is possible to modify the tag to use for container images with the --tag=latest parameter to the install command. Changing the containers images and version parameters is dangerous and can cause a non-functional system. By default, the Uyuni Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services. However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with -tag and -image. 例如，可以按如下方式使用此命令： mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds is the image to use and 0.1.0 is the version tag, before restarting it. To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters: mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it. Uyuni Proxy 容器以所谓的 node-port 服务形式工作。这意味着代理容器 Pod 会共享容器主机网络 TCP 和 UDP 端口空间。因此，容器主机防火墙必须配置为接受 Uyuni Proxy 容器所用端口上的传入流量。这些端口包括： 69/UDP - TFTP 80/TCP - HTTP 443/TCP - HTTPS 4505/TCP - Salt 4506/TCP - Salt 8022/TCP - SSH Continue with setting up the installed Uyuni Proxy as a containers at 容器化 Uyuni Proxy 设置.","title":"Install containerized Uyuni Proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"proxy-container-installation-uyuni","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/proxy-container-installation-uyuni.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This guide presumes you have already successfully deployed a Uyuni 2024.07 Server. To successfully deploy, you will perform the following actions: Checklist: Proxy Deployment Review hardware requirements. Synchronize the openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 parent channel and the Proxy extension child channel on the server. Install openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 on a bare-metal machine. During the installation, register openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 along with the Uyuni 2024.07 Proxy extension. Create a Salt activation key. Bootstrap the Proxy as a Salt minion. Generate a Proxy configuration. Transfer the Proxy configuration from Server to Proxy Use the Proxy configuration to register the Salt minion as a Proxy with Uyuni. Supported operating system for the Proxy Container Host The supported operating system for the container host is openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. Container host A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. This table shows the hardware requirements for deploying Uyuni Proxy. Table 1. 代理硬件要求 Hardware Details Recommendation CPU x86-64, ARM Minimum 2 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores RAM Minimum 2 GB Recommended 8 GB Disk Space / (root directory) Minimum 40 GB /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/srv-www Minimum 100 GB, Storage requirements should be calculated for the number of ISO distribution images, containers, and bootstrap repositories you will use. /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-cache (Squid) Minimum 100 GB Products are listed on the Admin Setup Wizard → Products page.

Task: Update the Proxy Host Select the host from the Systems list and apply all patches to update it. Reboot the Proxy host. The configuration archive of the Uyuni Proxy is generated by the Uyuni Server. Each additional Proxy requires its own configuration archive. The container host for the Uyuni Proxy must be registered as a salt minion to the Uyuni Server prior to generating this Proxy configuration. You will perform the following tasks: Generate a Proxy configuration file. Transfer the configuration to the Proxy. Start the Proxy with the mgrpxy command. Task: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration using Web UI 在 Web UI 中，导航到系统 代理配置，然后填写所需数据： 在代理 FQDN字段中，键入代理的完全限定域名。 在父 FQDN字段中，键入 Uyuni 服务器或另一个 Uyuni 代理的完全限定域名。 在代理 SSH 端口字段中，键入 SSH 服务在 Uyuni 代理上监听的 SSH 端口。建议保留默认值 8022。 在最大 Squid 缓存大小 [MB]字段中，键入允许的最大 Squid 缓存大小。一般该值最多应为容器可用存储空间的 60 %。 在 SSH 证书选择列表中，选择应为 Uyuni 代理生成新服务器证书还是使用现有证书。您可以考虑作为 Uyuni 内置（自我签名）证书生成的证书。 然后根据所做的选择提供用于生成新证书的签名 CA 证书的路径，或者要用作代理证书的现有证书及其密钥的路径。 The CA certificates generated on the server are stored in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/ssl-build directory. 有关现有或自定义证书的详细信息以及企业和中间证书的概念，请参见 导入 SSL 证书。 单击 生成 以在 Uyuni 服务器中注册新代理 FQDN，并生成包含容器主机细节的配置存档。 片刻之后，系统会显示文件可供下载。请将此文件保存在本地。 The Web UI generates a configuration archive. This archive needs to be made available on the Proxy container host. Task: Copy the Proxy configuration Copy the files from the Server container to the Server host OS: mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz . Next copy the files from the Server host OS to the Proxy host: scp config.tar.gz :/root Install the Proxy with: mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz Container can now be started with the mgrpxy command: Task: Start and Check Proxy Status Start the Proxy by calling: mgrpxy start Check container status by calling: mgrpxy status 应该会显示五个 Uyuni Proxy 容器： proxy-salt-broker proxy-httpd proxy-tftpd proxy-squid proxy-ssh And should be part of the proxy-pod container pod. By default, the Uyuni Proxy suite is set to use the same image version and registry path for each of its services. However, it is possible to override the default values for a specific service using the install parameters ending with -tag and -image. 例如，可以按如下方式使用此命令： mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz It adjusts the configuration file for the httpd service, where registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds is the image to use and 0.1.0 is the version tag, before restarting it. To reset the values to defaults, run the install command again without those parameters: mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz This command first resets the configuration of all services to the global defaults and then reloads it.","title":"Deploy a Uyuni 2024.07 Proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"proxy-deployment-uyuni","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/proxy-deployment-uyuni.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

What is air-gapped deployment? Air-gapped deployment refers to the setup and operation of any networked system that is physically isolated from insecure networks, especially the internet. This type of deployment is commonly used in high-security environments such as military installations, financial systems, critical infrastructure, and anywhere sensitive data is handled and must be protected from external threats. You can easily deploy container images using Podman, Docker, or Skopeo on a machine with internet access. Pull the desired image then, save the image as a tar archive. For example: Listing 1.

Persistent volumes In this section, you will gain expertise in setting up and deploying a Uyuni Server. The process encompasses the installation of Podman, Uyuni container utilities, deployment, and then initiating interaction with the container through mgrctl. This section assumes you have already configured an openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 host server, whether it is running on a physical machine or within a virtual environment. For general requirements, see General requirements. An openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 server should be installed from installation media. This procedure is described below. For CPU, RAM, and storage requirements, see Hardware requirements. To guarantee that clients can resolve the FQDN domain name, both the containerized server and the host machines must be linked to a functional DNS server. Additionally, it is essential to ensure correct configuration of reverse lookups. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 On your local host open a terminal window or start up a virtual machine running openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. Login. Enter the transactional-update shell: transactional-update shell Add the following repository to your openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 server: zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable:/ContainerUtils/openSUSE_Leap_Micro_5.5/systemsmanagement:Uyuni:Stable:ContainerUtils.repo Refresh the repository list and accept the key: zypper ref Install the container tools: zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion netavark Exit the transactional shell: transactional update # exit Reboot the host. For more information on the Uyuni Container Utilities, see Uyuni Container Utilities. Uyuni is deployed as a container using the mgradm tool. There are two methods of deploying a Uyuni server as a container. In this section we will focus on basic container deployment. For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy, see Custom YAML Configuration and Deployment with mgradm. For additional information, you can explore further by running mgradm --help from the command line. Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman From the terminal run the following command as the sudo user or as root. sudo mgradm install podman You must deploy the container as sudo or root. The following error will be displayed at the terminal if you miss this step. INF Setting up uyuni network 9:58AM INF Enabling system service 9:58AM FTL Failed to open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service for writing error=\"open /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service: permission denied\" Wait for deployment to complete. Open a browser and proceed to your servers FQDN. In this section you learned how to deploy an Uyuni Server container. Many users will want to specify locations for their persistent volumes. If you are just testing out Uyuni you do not need to specify these volumes. mgradm will setup the correct volumes by default. Specifying volume locations will generally be used for larger production deployments. By default podman stores its volumes in /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/. You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk. This is especially important for the database and package mirrors. For a list of all persistent volumes in the container, see List of persistent storage volumes.","title":"Deploy on openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"server-deployment-uyuni","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/server-deployment-uyuni.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Migrating To migrate a regular Uyuni server to a container, a new machine is required. It is not possible to perform an in-place migration. The original server is referred to as the source server, while the newly set-up machine is designated as the destination server. The migration procedure currently does not include any hostname renaming functionality. Consequently, the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the new server will remain identical to that on the source server. Therefore, following migration, it will be necessary to manually adjust the DNS records to point to the new server. Procedure: Initial preparation Stop the source server: spacewalk-service stop Stop the source services: systemctl stop postgresql Procedure: Preparing the SSH connection The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the host for a passwordless connection to the source server. To establish a passwordless connection, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the server. If one isn’t active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then, add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add /path/to/the/private/key. You’ll be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. The migration script only uses the source server fully qualified domain name in the SSH command. This means that every other configuration required to connect needs to be defined in the ~/.ssh/config file. Before executing the migration command with mgradm migrate, it’s essential to predefine Persistent Volumes, especially considering that the migration job initiates the container from scratch. Please consult the installation section for comprehensive guidance on preparing these volumes.

Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_5 \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_5-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_5-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-155 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see 注册 openSUSE Leap 客户端. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see 注册 openSUSE Leap 客户端. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see Register Clients with a Bootstrap Script. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL 证书. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

Optional: Synchronizing Products from SUSE Customer Center This quick start guide shows you how to install and configure a Uyuni 2024.07 container for x86-64 architecture on openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. This table shows the software and hardware requirements for deploying Uyuni Server. Table 1. Bare metal Host Software and Hardware Requirements Software and Hardware Recommended Operating System: openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5: CPU: Minimum 4 dedicated 64-bit x86-64CPU cores RAM: Development server Minimum 16 GB Production server Minimum 32 GB Disk Space: Disk space depends on your channel requirements, at least 100 GB 50 GB per SUSE or openSUSE product and 360 GB per Red Hat product Swap space: 3 GB Official operating system for the Server Container Host The supported operating system for the container host is openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5. Container host A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. Server deployment mandates the use of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). In the absence of automatic DNS provision of an FQDN by your router or network, the deployment process will not proceed successfully. An FQDN typically follows the format ..com. For instance: uyuni.example.com uyuni.fritz.box uyuni.container.lab For additional details, refer to the section on network requirements in the Installation and Upgrade Guide, available at 网络要求. Proceed to: Download openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 Select and download the Offline Image. Prepare a USB fash disk or DVD for installation. Insert a DVD or a bootable USB stick containing the installation image for openSUSE Leap. Boot or reboot your system. For detailed documentation on preparing your machines OS (virtual or physical), see SLE Micro 5.5 Deployment Guide. Procedure: openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 Installation Use the arrow keys to select Installation. On the Language, Keyboard and license Agreement page click Next. On the NTP Configuration page click Next. On the Authentication for the System page enter a password for the root user. Click Next. On the Installation Settings page click Install. Login at the prompt as root.

Uyuni is deployed as a container using the mgradm tool. There are two methods of deploying a Uyuni server as a container. In this section we will focus on basic container deployment. For information on using a custom configuration file to deploy see, Configuration and deployment with mgradm and a custom yaml file. For additional information, you can explore further by running mgradm --help from the command line. Procedure: Deploying an Uyuni container with Podman From the terminal run the following command as root. mgradm install podman Input a password for the CA certificate, an administrative account password and your email for notifications: leapmicro:~ # mgradm install podman 3:07PM INF Welcome to mgradm 3:07PM INF Executing command: podman Password for the CA certificate to generate: Administrator password: Administrator's email: admin@example.com The container will take some minutes to deploy. Once complete open a browser and visit https://leapmicro.uyuni.lab to begin working with Uyuni. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This table lists architecture, channels, and status information. If your SUSE Linux Enterprise client is based on x86_64 architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products to start product synchronization. When a channel is added, Uyuni will schedule the channel for synchronization. Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time. You can monitor synchronization progress in the Web UI. For more information about using the setup wizard, see Wizard. When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients. For more instructions, see 客户端注册.","title":"Deploy Uyuni 2024.07 Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"quickstart-deploy-uyuni-server","url":"/uyuni/quickstart/container-deployment/uyuni/quickstart-deploy-uyuni-server.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring your own subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pay as you go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in 公有云要求. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete setup in the Uyuni Web UI.","title":"Initial setup","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"setup","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/byos/setup.html","titles":[]},"557":{"id":557,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

I no longer require support; how can I end the Uyuni PAYG subscription? Last updated: October 2023 BYOS Bring-your-own-subscription Uyuni deployments are supported on the cloud, however, billing will not be via the cloud marketplace. Once the existing subscription term ends, you can purchase Uyuni PAYG via the cloud provider marketplace and manage your instances with a Uyuni deployment that is billed via the cloud. Yes, the listing works independently from your existing BYOS Uyuni subscriptions. Please remember that support processes may be different for deployments using your existing BYOS subscription and those billed via the cloud and note that there is currently no process for migrating deployments between BYOS and PAYG versions. When purchasing Uyuni via the AWS & Azure Marketplaces, the billing is as follows: Billing is monthly and handled via cloud marketplace. Managed instances are recorded hourly. The peak usage total is recorded for the month. There is a monthly usage charge for each instance in the count. SLES for SAP Applications PAYG/on-demand instances, when purchased via the cloud marketplace, include Lifecycle Management(LCM) entitlements for Uyuni. The Uyuni PAYG billing engine recognizes the embedded LCM entitlements and does not include them in the count. This means there are no additional charges to manage these with the Uyuni PAYG listing. However, if Uyuni Monitoring is required for these instances, additional charges will apply for this feature. If using the Uyuni PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace, billing will commence from the time of deployment and when applicable client instances are on-boarded to Uyuni. There is the Uyuni BYOS listing in the cloud marketplace that can be used, a trial subscription key can be obtained via the SUSE Website. This deployment cannot be directly converted to allow billing via cloud marketplaces. To benefit from monthly billing via the cloud marketplace, Uyuni needs to be redeployed using the version from the PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace. Billing is based on the number of managed instances. Below are 3 examples of how the node count is calculated, check the table below for the detail. Static usage Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management, for 1 month with no additional managed clients added in the month. Bursting Model Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management for 3 weeks in the month, bursting to 30 managed instances for 1 week. Transient model A temporary deployment of Uyuni with 20 managed instances, for 2 weeks (336 hours) The total is calculated by counting number of active nodes (checked hourly). There is a monthly charge for each managed node under management in the billing cycle. Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated. Table 1. Usage calculations for different scenarios Managed Instances Peak Usage Billed for Static Usage 10 10 10 Bursting Model 10 - 3 Weeks, 30 - 1 Week 30 30 Transient Cluster 20 - 2 Weeks 20 20 It is dependent on the deployment and the cloud provider, as every Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has its own commercial terms and offers. It may be possible to secure special commercial terms such as an annual subscription. For example, AWS can offer Uyuni PAYG via a Private Offer. Please contact SUSE for more information. There are such programs at the cloud providers: Azure MACC Program AWS Enterprise Discount Program Google CUD Yes, it can. Please contact your cloud provider sales team for more details. Once Uyuni PAYG has been deployed from the marketplace listing and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase to manage additional instances. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of instances Uyuni is managing. Just on-board additional instances to Uyuni as needed, this will be reflected in your cloud marketplace bill. By default, the Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is ongoing for as long as Uyuni is deployed and instances are registered. Currently, there is no volume discount available. If you no longer require support, there are 2 options: Unregister all systems from the Uyuni Server Terminate the Uyuni instance.","title":"Billing - General","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-billing-general","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-billing-general.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

What client Operating Systems are supported with Uyuni PAYG? Currently, it is not possible to migrate an existing instance to the PAYG version. Customers can simply deploy a new Uyuni PAYG instance from the cloud marketplace and re-onboard all instances using the standard process. Client configuration overview It is simple to open a support case with SUSE for Uyuni PAYG. Create a ‘supportconfig’ via Uyuni PAYG instance CLI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) at the following link: https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport Providing marketplace billing is active, a support case will be opened. The Uyuni PAYG product available in the cloud marketplace is the same product, with similar functionality that you would run on-premises or with a manual installation. The only exceptions being the ability to bill via the cloud marketplace and connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure for Uyuni product updates. It is also worth checking the list of supported client operating systems to ensure your needs are met. It is recommended that the Uyuni instance always remains active. Uyuni PAYG, when deployed via the cloud marketplace will automatically connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure, no separate Uyuni subscription key is required. Updates to the Uyuni instance can be applied from those channels using standard SUSE tooling (i.e. zypper). Yes, Uyuni Hub is recommended for customers with more than 10,000 managed clients. If the Uyuni Hub instance has no connected clients, there will be no charge for the Uyuni Hub software components. Billing will occur from the downstream Uyuni PAYG Server instance, where managed instances are connected. To manage BYOS instances, SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Yes, it is possible to manage instances, in the cloud, on premises or both. To enable management of SUSE workloads in an on-premises data center, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider's network. With a hybrid landscape, egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider. To reduce these costs, SUSE recommend the use of the containerized proxy. Please note: Whilst the SUSE Manger Proxy usage is included as part of the Uyuni PAYG subscription, an LCM+ subscription will be billed if the proxy is also a managed workload, so in other words it counted as a managed client.

Last updated: October 2023 No, all components needed to handle the billing are part of the Uyuni PAYG code base. The cloud marketplace listing for Uyuni PAYG will deploy a Uyuni instance, together with the embedded billing engine. The cloud marketplace listing for Uyuni PAYG is tied to a specific version of Uyuni (4.3.8 at launch). Future listings will typically include the latest version available at the time of product/image creation. Please check the listing for further information. No, there is no choice over the Uyuni version when deploying using the cloud marketplace listing. If a prior version of Uyuni is required, this will need to be installed manually using the standard documentation and BYOS billing. The Marketplace listing is tied to a specific version of Uyuni, which is the latest version available at the time of the listing. Typically, the listing in the cloud marketplace is updated quarterly, or more frequently if there are security issues. It is worth noting that the image update process may not be fully aligned to the Uyuni product maintenance releases (every 6-8 weeks), so Uyuni PAYG instances should be patched regularly after deployment. Yes, the billing mechanism for the products is independent. Each deployment will be billed separately via the cloud marketplace. Existing deployments cannot be directly converted or updated to provide billing via the cloud marketplace. To benefit from monthly billing, Uyuni PAYG must be deployed directly from the cloud marketplace listing.","title":"Billing - Technical","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-billing-technical","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-billing-technical.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Last updated: October 2023 By selecting the Uyuni PAYG listing from the cloud marketplace, customers can deploy Uyuni to their cloud environment with the advantage of having monthly billing via the cloud provider. Customers still have the option of using Uyuni BYOS (Bring-your-own-subscription), for which subscriptions and billing is handled directly by SUSE. The listings can be found in the AWS & Azure Marketplaces. There are two listings: On the AWS Marketplace, you will find the following: Uyuni Server Family (Non-EU and non-UK only) Uyuni Server Family (EU and UK only) On the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, you will find: Uyuni with 24x7 Support Uyuni with 24x7 Support (EMEA Orders Only) For the purposes of this FAQ, we will refer to these listings as Uyuni PAYG. We have 2 listings for Uyuni: EU and UK only / EMEA Orders Only non-EU and non-UK only. You should pick the listing that reflects in which country your AWS & Azure account gets billed. The Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is not available to purchase in all countries. In case it is not available in your country you can still use the BYOS option. Your billing country is based on the AWS & Azure Account ID used to do the deployment. You can find out more about confirming your tax location as follows: For Amazon Web Services, it depends on the tax address of the account, see Tax help based on location For Microsoft Azure, it depends on the sold to address of the account, see Azure account profile Please see the link at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact Uyuni PAYG via the cloud marketplaces. If your cloud provider account is billed to one of the allowed countries, it is possible to deploy Uyuni in any region. It is not possible to transact/bill Uyuni PAYG via AWS & Azure Marketplaces in China. It is possible to deploy into regions in China. This means you can deploy Uyuni in a region in China if your billing is performed in a country that has the PAYG option available. Please see the addendum at the end of this FAQ for a list of countries that can and cannot transact Uyuni PAYG via the cloud. Yes, for customers that wish to use an existing annual Uyuni subscription, the BYOS Uyuni listing is available. If a Uyuni Proxy is required as part of the architecture, it is suggested to use the containerized proxy. See the SUSE documentation at: documentation.suse.com Select Uyuni Uyuni {2024.07} Installation and Upgrade guide Installation Uyuni Proxy Install Containerized Proxy From the subscription point of view, Uyuni Proxy is a managed client. There is no need to subscribe twice. Subscribing to the listing in the cloud provider marketplace allow the Uyuni PAYG instance to perform metered billing for Uyuni usage. If you onboard an instance and enable Uyuni monitoring, there is a monthly charge for management and another charge for monitoring.","title":"Public Cloud Listings","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-listings","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-listings.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Registering Clients PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) Images Connecting and registering PAYG images is supported and can be done without additional prerequisites. BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) Images Registering BYOS images requires SCC (SUSE Customer Center) credentials beforehand. If a user attempts to onboard a BYOS image without providing SCC credentials, the operation will fail, as these credentials are required to verify your subscription. Always verify the type of image (PAYG or BYOS) prior to initiating the registration process with Uyuni to ensure a smooth and error-free connection. If you have SCC credentials ensure your SCC credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions for utilizing BYOS images. Do not register PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center. Only BYOS instances should be registered against the SUSE Customer Center. Registering PAYG instances with the SUSE Customer Center or your own RMT server will create conflicts that are not easily solved. PAYG instances are automatically registered against the correct update server when added to your cloud service provider Uyuni instance. For more information on using SUSE PAYG products such as SUSE Linux Enterprise in the public cloud see: SUSE Linux Enterprise Public Cloud Guide It is important to recognize that there is a difference between Pay-as-you-go connections and bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is also known as client registration. Once you have started up your Uyuni PAYG instance and refreshed products you can add Pay-as-you-go connections via the Admin Setup Wizard Pay-as-you-go +Add Pay-as-you-go button. This action links your Uyuni PAYG instance with additional PAYG products on Microsoft Azure. Bootstrapping or client registration is the process of onboarding clients in Uyuni. The registration process installs the appropriate client tools and provides full management functionality. To manage your clients, start by establishing connections and then proceed to bootstrap your clients. These two actions are the steps required for initiating and completing the client onboarding process. Procedure: Connecting SUSE Linux Enterprise PAYG instances to Uyuni PAYG Return to the SUSE Manager Server WebUI. Navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Pay-as-you-go and click the +Add Pay-as-you-go button. Add a description. Complete the instance SSH connection data: Host: CSP URL of the machine SSH Port: 22 User: root Password: SSH Private Key Click Create and wait for the sync to finish. Proceed to Admin Setup Wizard Products to access your PAYG SUSE Linux Enterprise products. Now that you have established connections to the Uyuni PAYG instance you can register them as clients.

Network Configuration 2. Configure Storage Procedure: Login and update the system SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system. sudo -i zypper refresh zypper update Before initiating yast2 susemanager_setup, ensure the network is correctly configured for Microsoft Azure. For Uyuni PAYG setup it is required, that a new Virtual Network and a new subnet is configured. It is impossible to setup the instance in an existing network. When you setup new clients which should be managed, take care that you put them into the private subnet which is configured with Uyuni PAYG. If you want to manage systems in an already existing network, you must configure peering. Procedure: Network Configuration Ensure the network configuration aligns such that hostname -f yields the identical name as the reverse DNS lookup of the private IP address. For instance, when executing nslookup 10.0.0.X. Insert the private IP with its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into /etc/hosts. For example: 10.0.0.4 instancename.internal.cloudapp.net Edit /etc/sysconfig/network/config and append internal.cloudapp.net to NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST. Execute netconfig update. Subsequently, hostname -f should return the same FQDN as obtained from nslookup 10.0.0.X. When adding new virtual machines (VMs), such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5, it’s crucial to ensure that they are configured within the same subnet as the SUSE Manager instance. This step is essential for successful network setup and integration. Additionally, be mindful of the geographical restrictions associated with your plans. Make sure to utilize the appropriate Azure accounts which correspond to the specific geographic zones of your project. SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system. sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Configure storage with the mgr-storage-server tool or in the case of the proxy use mgr-storage-proxy. For more information, see mgr-storage-server --help or mgr-storage-proxy --help. This tool simplifies creating the container storage and database volumes. Format the command in the following manner: mgr-storage-server [] #For example: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 This command will create the following persistent storage volumes at /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes: For more information, see List of persistent storage volumes.
