":"Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled{ldquo}GNU Free Documentation License{rdquo}. If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the “ with…​Texts.” line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

Keycloak refers to endpoints as clients. 过程：将端点添加为客户端 在 Keycloak Web UI 中，使用以下细节创建新客户端： In the Client type field, select SAML. 在客户端 ID 字段中，输入服务器配置文件中以 java.sso.onelogin.saml2.idp.entityid 形式指定的端点。 For example, https:///rhn/manager/sso/metadata. In the Settings tab, fine-tune the client using these details: Toggle the Sign assertions switch to On. In the Signature algorithm field, select RSA_SHA1. 在 SAML 签名密钥名称字段中选择密钥 ID。 In the Keys tab: Set Client signature required to Off. In the Advanced tab, in the Fine Grain SAML Endpoint Configuration section, add the two endpoints using these details: 在声明使用者服务字段中，输入服务器配置文件中以 java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url 形式指定的端点。 For example, https:///rhn/manager/sso/acs. 在注销服务字段中，输入服务器配置文件中以 java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.single_logout_service.url 形式指定的端点。 For example, https:///rhn/manager/sso/sls. 将端点添加为客户端后，可以配置客户端范围，并在 Keycloak 和 Uyuni 之间映射用户。 过程：配置客户端范围和映射程序 In the Keycloak Web UI, navigate to the Clients Client scopes tab and assign role_list as the default client scope. Navigate to the Client_scopes Mappers tab and add a mapper for user attribute uid, using the default values. Uyuni 需要此 SAML 属性。 Navigate to the Client_scopes Mappers and click on role_list mapper. Set Single Role Attribute to On. 导航到用户 管理员部分并创建一个管理用户。 此用户不需要与 Uyuni 管理用户匹配。 Navigate to the Users Role mappings tab, add an attribute named uid with a value that matches the username of the Uyuni administrative user. 导航到用户 身份凭证选项卡，设置 Uyuni 管理用户所用的同一口令。 . 保存更改。 When you have completed the configuration, you can test that the installation is working as expected. Restart the Uyuni Server to pick up your changes, and navigate to the Uyuni Web UI. If your installation is working correctly, you are redirected to the Keycloak SSO page, where you can authenticate successfully.","title":"示例 SSO 实现","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auth-methods-sso-example","url":"/uyuni/administration/auth-methods-sso-example.html","titles":[]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 先决条件 2. 启用 SSO Uyuni 通过实现安全声明标记语言 (SAML) 2 协议来支持单点登录 (SSO)。 单点登录是一种身份验证过程，它允许用户使用一组身份凭证访问多个应用程序。SAML 是一套基于 XML 的标准，用于交换身份验证和授权数据。SAML 身份服务提供者 (IdP) 向服务提供者 (SP) 提供身份验证和授权服务，例如 Uyuni。Uyuni 公开三个端点，必须启用它们才能进行单点登录。 Uyuni 中的 SSO 支持： 使用 SSO 登录。 使用服务提供者发起的单点注销 (SLO) 和身份服务提供者单点注销服务 (SLS) 注销。 声明和 nameId 加密。 声明签名。 使用 AuthNRequest、LogoutRequest 和 LogoutResponses 进行消息签名。 启用声明使用者服务端点。 启用单点注销服务端点。 发布 SP 元数据（可签名）。 Uyuni 中的 SSO 不支持： 身份服务提供者 (IdP) 的产品选择和实现。 对其他产品的 SAML 支持（请查看相关的产品文档）。 有关 SSO 的示例实现，请参见 示例 SSO 实现。 如果您从默认身份验证方法更改为单点登录，则新的 SSO 身份凭证仅适用于 Web UI。mgr-sync 或 spacecmd 等客户端工具仍然只能使用默认身份验证方法。 在开始之前，需要事先使用这些参数配置一个外部身份服务提供者。请查看 IdP 文档获取说明。 The mapping between the IdP user and the Uyuni user is specified in a SAML:Attribute. The SAML:Attribute must be configured in the IdP and must be passed to Uyuni in the SAML authentication. The attribute must be named uid and must contain the Uyuni user mapped to it after login. The Uyuni must be created before you activate single sign-on. 需要以下端点： 声明使用者服务 (ACS)：接受 SAML 消息以建立与服务提供者的会话的端点。 Uyuni 中 ACS 的端点是：https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/acs 单点注销服务 (SLS)：从 IdP 发起注销请求的端点。 Uyuni 中 SLS 的端点是：https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/sls 元数据：用于检索 SAML 的 Uyuni 元数据的端点。 Uyuni 中元数据的端点是：https://server.example.com/rhn/manager/sso/metadata 使用用户 orgadmin 成功通过 IdP 完成身份验证后，您将以 orgadmin 用户身份登录到 Uyuni，前提是 Uyuni 中存在 orgadmin 用户。 SSO 与其他类型的身份验证是互斥的：请要么启用，要么禁用 SSO。默认已禁用 SSO。 过程：启用 SSO 如果您的用户在 Uyuni 中尚不存在，请先创建他们。 编辑 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf，在文件末尾添加下面一行： java.sso = true 在 /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf 中找到您要自定义的参数。 将要自定义的参数插入 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf，并在这些参数的前面加上 java.sso. 作为前缀。例如，在 /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_java_sso.conf 中找到： onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs 要自定义此参数，请在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中创建相应的选项并在选项名称前面加上java.sso. 作为前缀： java.sso.onelogin.saml2.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = https://YOUR-PRODUCT-HOSTNAME-OR-IP/rhn/manager/sso/acs 要查找您需要更改的所有参数实例，请在文件中搜索占位符 YOUR-PRODUCT 和 YOUR-IDP-ENTITY。每个参数都附带了其作用的简要说明。 重启动 spacewalk 服务以应用更改： spacewalk-service restart 访问 Uyuni URL 时，您将重定向到 SSO 的 IdP，需要在其中完成身份验证。身份验证成功后，您将重定向到 Uyuni Web UI，并以经过身份验证的用户身份登录。如果您在使用 SSO 登录时遇到问题，请查看 Uyuni 日志了解详细信息。","title":"使用单点登录 (SSO)

依赖于某个数据库以及已安装的程序和配置，因此备份所有安装组件非常重要。本章包含有关需要备份的文件的信息，并介绍如何使用 smdba 工具来管理数据库备份。其中还包含有关在发生系统故障时如何从备份中还原的信息。 无论您使用哪种备份方法，可用空间必须是当前安装使用的空间量的至少三倍。空间不足可能导致备份失败，因此请经常检查可用空间。 备份 Uyuni 安装的最完整方法是备份相关文件和目录。这可以节省备份管理时间，并且在发生故障时可以更快地重新安装和重新同步。但是，这种方法需要大量磁盘空间，并且可能需要很长时间才能完成备份。 如果您只想备份所需的文件和目录，请使用以下列表。为使此过程更简单、更完整，我们建议备份整个 /etc 和 /root 目录，而不仅仅是此处指定的目录。某些文件仅在您实际使用相关 SUSE Manager 功能时才存在。 /etc/cobbler/ /etc/dhcp.conf /etc/fstab 和所需的任何 ISO 挂载点。 如果您的 UUID 已更改，请确保已相应地更新 fstab 项。 /etc/rhn/ /etc/salt /etc/sudoers /etc/sysconfig/rhn/ /root/.gnupg/ /root/.ssh 如果您使用 SSH 隧道或 SSH push，则此文件存在。此外，必须已保存 id-susemanager 键的副本。 /root/ssl-build/ /srv/formula_metadata /srv/pillar /srv/salt /srv/susemanager /srv/tftpboot/ /srv/www/cobbler /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ /srv/www/os-images

/var/spacewalk/ 包含自定义数据（例如脚本、Kickstart 或 AutoYaST 配置文件和自定义 RPM）的任何目录。 还需要备份您的数据库，此操作可以使用 smdba 工具来完成。 过程：从手动备份中还原 重新安装 Uyuni Server。有关详细信息，请参见 安装 Uyuni 2023.02 Server。 使用 yast2 susemanager_setup 安装 Uyuni Server。有关详细信息，请参见 SUSE Manager Server 设置。 使用 Uyuni Web UI 或在命令提示符下使用 mgr-sync 工具重新同步您的 Uyuni 软件源。您可以选择重新注册产品，或跳过注册和 SSL 证书生成部分。 重新安装 /root/ssl-build/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-MACHINE_NAME-VER-REL.noarch.rpm 软件包。 安排在下次启动 rhn-search 服务时重新创建搜索索引。此命令仅生成调试消息，而不生成错误消息： rhn-search cleanindex 检查是否需要还原 /var/spacewalk/packages/。如果 /var/spacewalk/packages/ 不在您的备份中，则需要还原它。如果源软件源可用，则您可以通过完整通道同步来还原 /var/spacewalk/packages/： mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels smdba 工具用于管理本地 PostgreSQL 数据库。使用此工具可以备份和还原数据库，以及管理备份。它还可用于检查数据库的状态，以及执行管理任务，例如重启动。有关 smdba 工具的详细信息，请参见 [reference:cli-smdba]。 smdba 工具仅适用于本地 PostgreSQL 数据库，而不适用于远程访问的数据库或 Oracle 数据库。 smdba 工具需要 sudo 访问权限，以便能够执行系统更改。在开始之前，请通过检查 /etc/sudoers 文件中的下面一行，来确保为 admin 用户启用了 sudo 访问权限： admin ALL=(postgres) /usr/bin/smdba 使用以下命令检查数据库的运行时状态： smdba db-status 此命令返回 online 或 offline，例如： Checking database core... online 可使用以下命令启动和停止数据库： smdba db-start 和 smdba db-stop smdba 工具执行连续存档备份。这种备份方法将合并当前会话期间对数据库所做和每项更改的日志，以及一系列较传统的备份文件。发生崩溃时，首先会从磁盘上和最近备份文件中还原数据库状态，然后精确重放当前会话的日志，使数据库恢复到当前状态。smdba 连续存档备份是在数据库正在运行的情况下执行的，因此无需停机。 这种备份方法非常稳定，通常会创建一致的快照，但可能会占用大量储存空间。请确保至少提供当前数据库大小三倍的可用空间用于备份。可以通过导航到 /var/lib/pgsql/ 并运行 df -h 来检查当前数据库大小。 smdba 工具还可以管理存档，仅保留最近的备份和当前日志存档。日志文件的最大文件为 16 MB，因此，当文件达到此大小时会创建一个新日志文件。每次创建新备份时，会清除以前的备份以释放磁盘空间。我们建议您使用 cron 来安排 smdba 备份以确保您的储存得到有效管理，并随时准备好一个备份，以防发生故障。 smdba 工具可直接从命令行运行。我们建议您在安装后立即运行手动数据库备份，或者在对配置进行任何重大更改后运行手动备份。 首次运行 smdba 或者更改了备份位置时，需要先重启动数据库，然后再执行存档。这会导致短暂的停机。定期数据库备份完全不需要停机。 过程：执行手动数据库备份 为备份分配永久储存空间。此示例使用 /var/spacewalk/ 中的目录。此目录将成为备份的永久目标，因此请确保您的服务器始终可以访问此目录。 在您的备份位置为备份创建一个目录： 以 root 身份运行以下命令： install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup 确保您对备份位置拥有适当的权限： chown postgres:postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup 首次创建备份时，请运行 smdba backup-hot 命令并设置 enable 选项。这会在指定的目录中创建备份，并根据需要重启动数据库： smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup 此命令将生成调试消息，成功完成时会返回以下输出： INFO: Finished 检查 /var/spacewalk/db-backup 目录中是否存在备份文件，确保备份成功。 无需关闭系统即可使用 smdba 执行数据库备份。但是，由于备份是一项大规模操作，因此在运行备份时，数据库性能可能会下降。我们建议您将定期数据库备份安排在低流量时段，以尽量减少中断。 请确保至少提供当前数据库大小三倍的可用空间用于备份。可以通过导航到 /var/lib/pgsql/ 并运行 df -h 来检查当前数据库大小。 过程：安排自动备份 为备份创建一个目录并设置适当的权限（以 root 身份）： install -m 700 -o postgres -g postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup 打开 /etc/cron.d/db-backup-mgr（如果该文件不存在，请创建），并在其中添加下面一行内容以创建 cron 作业： 0 2 * * * root /usr/bin/smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup 定期检查备份目录以确保备份按预期进行。 发生故障时，可以使用 smdba 工具从备份中还原。 过程：从备份中还原 关闭数据库： smdba db-stop 启动还原过程并等待它完成： smdba backup-restore start 重启动数据库： smdba db-start 检查 RPM 和数据库之间是否有差异。 spacewalk-data-fsck 数据库管理工具 smdba 可以通过存档日志记录来执行热备份。在包含嵌入式数据库的 Uyuni 中，默认已启用存档日志记录。 PostgreSQL 维护有限数量的存档日志。在使用默认配置的情况下，大约可以储存 64 个大小为 16 MiB 的文件。 创建用户并同步通道： SLES12-SP2-Pool-x86_64 SLES12-SP2-Updates-x86_64 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool-x86_64-SP2 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates-x86_64-SP2 PostgreSQL 会额外生成大约 1 GB 数据。因此，请务必考虑备份策略并定期创建备份。 存档日志储存在 /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog/ (postgresql)

AppStream 过滤器 本节提供了一些常见示例来说明如何使用内容生命周期管理。请使用这些示例来构建您自己的个性化实现。 每月增补周期的示例项目包括： 创建一个按日期过滤器 将过滤器添加到项目 将过滤器应用于新项目构建 从项目中排除补丁 在项目中包含补丁 按日期过滤器排除指定日期之后发布的所有补丁。此过滤器对于遵循每月增补周期的内容生命周期项目很有用。 过程：创建按日期过滤器 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中键入过滤器的名称。 例如，按日期排除补丁。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（发布日期）。 在匹配器字段中，已自动选择晚于或等于。 选择日期和时间。 单击 保存。 过程：将过滤器添加到项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目并从列表中选择一个项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器 链接以查看所有可用的过滤器 选择新的按日期排除补丁过滤器。 单击 保存。 新过滤器已添加到过滤器列表，但仍然需要将其应用于项目。要应用过滤器，需要构建第一个环境。 过程：使用过滤器 单击 构建 以构建第一个环境。 可选：添加消息。 可以使用消息来帮助跟踪构建历史记录。 在测试服务器上使用新通道来检查过滤器是否正常工作。 单击 升级 将内容移到下一个环境。 如果您有大量过滤器，或者过滤器非常复杂，则构建过程需要较长时间。 测试可以帮助您发现问题。如果发现问题，请排除按日期过滤器之前发布的有问题补丁。 过程：排除补丁 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中输入过滤器的名称。 例如，排除 openjdk 补丁。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（建议名称）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 在建议名称字段中键入建议名称。 例如，SUSE-15-2019-1807。 单击 保存。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器 链接，选择排除 openjdk 补丁，然后单击 保存。 当您使用 构建 按钮重构建项目时，新过滤器将与前面添加的按日期过滤器一起使用。 此示例假设您收到了一条安全警报。当前工作月刚过几天，发布了一个重要的安全补丁。新补丁的名称是SUSE-15-2019-2071。您需要将此新补丁包含在您的环境中。 允许过滤器规则会覆盖拒绝过滤器规则的排除功能。有关详细信息，请参见 内容生命周期管理。 过程：在项目中包含补丁 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中键入过滤器的名称。 例如，包含内核安全修复。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（建议名称）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 在建议名称字段中键入 SUSE-15-2019-2071，然后选中允许。 单击 保存 以储存该过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并从列表中选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，然后选择包含内核安全补丁。 单击 保存。 单击 构建 以重构建环境。 每月增补周期完成后，您可以更新下个月的增补周期。 过程：更新每月增补周期 在按日期字段中，将过滤器的日期更改为下个月。 或者，创建一个新过滤器并更改项目的指派。 检查是否可以将 SUSE-15-2019-1807 的排除过滤器从项目中分离。 可能有一个新补丁可以修复此问题。 分离前面添加的允许过滤器。 默认已包含该补丁。 重构建项目以创建包含下个月补丁的新环境。 本节介绍如何设置过滤器以创建可在线增补的环境。 当您准备使用在线增补时，需要注意一些重要事项 永远只在您的系统上使用一个内核版本。 在线增补软件包与特定内核一起安装。 在线增补更新作为一个补丁交付。 后续会安装一系列新在线增补内核的每个内核补丁会显示需要重引导标志。 这些内核补丁附带在线增补工具。安装这些补丁后，需要在下一年开始之前至少重引导系统一次。 仅安装与已安装内核版本匹配的在线补丁更新。 在线补丁作为独立补丁提供。 您必须排除内核版本高于当前安装版本的所有常规内核补丁。 在此示例中，您将使用 SUSE-15-2019-1244 补丁更新您的系统。此补丁包含 kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64。 需要排除所有包含较高版本 kernel-default 的补丁。 过程：排除内核版本较高的软件包 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中键入过滤器的名称。 例如，排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（包含软件包）。 在匹配器字段中选择版本大于。 在软件包名称字段中键入 kernel-default。 将纪元字段留空。 在版本字段中键入 4.12.14。 在发行版字段中键入 150.17.1。 单击 保存 以储存该过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包，然后单击 保存。 单击 构建 后，会创建一个新环境。新环境包含版本不高于所安装版本的所有内核补丁。 所有内核版本更高的内核补丁都将被去除。只要在线增补内核不是发行系列中的第一个，它们就仍然可用。 可以使用过滤器模板自动完成此过程。有关如何应用在线增补过滤器模板的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templates。 特定内核版本的在线增补仅可使用一年。一年后，您必须更新系统上的内核。执行以下环境更改： 过程：切换到新内核版本 确定要升级到哪个内核版本。 例如：4.12.14-150.32.1 创建新的内核版本过滤器。 分离先前创建的过滤器排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包并挂接新过滤器。 单击 构建 以重构建环境。新环境包含版本不高于所选新内核版本的所有内核补丁。使用这些通道的系统具有可供安装的内核更新。您需要在系统执行升级后重引导系统。新内核的有效期为一年。在当年安装的所有软件包与当前在线增补内核过滤器匹配。 如果您使用的是 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 客户端，则无法直接从模块化软件源（例如 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream 软件源）执行软件包操作，例如安装或升级。您可以使用 AppStream 过滤器将模块化软件源转换为常规软件源。为此，该过滤器会将软件包保留在软件源中，并除去模块元数据。可以在 Uyuni 中像使用常规软件源一样使用转换后的软件源。 AppStream 过滤器将选择要包含在目标软件源中的单个模块流。您可以添加多个过滤器来选择多个模块流。 如果您不在 CLM 项目中使用 AppStream 过滤器，则模块化源中的模块元数据将保持不变，并且目标软件源包含相同的模块元数据。只要在 CLM 项目中至少启用一个 AppStream 过滤器，所有目标软件源就会转换为常规软件源。 在某些情况下，您可能想要构建常规软件源，而不包含任何模块的软件包。要实现此目的，请使用匹配器无（禁用模块化）添加 AppStream 过滤器。这会在目标软件源中禁用所有模块。此设置非常适合用于 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 客户端，这种客户端大多数模块的默认版本均已包含在作为常规软件源提供的 AppStream 软件源中。 要使用 AppStream 过滤器，需要一个包含模块化软件源（例如 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream）的 CLM 项目。在开始之前，请确保包含所需的模块作为源。 过程：使用 AppStream 过滤器 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到您的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLM 项目。 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 在模块名称字段中键入模块名称。 例如 postgresql。 在流字段中键入所需流的名称。 例如 10。如果将此字段留空，则会选择模块的默认流。 单击 保存 以创建新过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，选择您的新 AppStream 过滤器，然后单击 保存。 可以使用创建/编辑过滤器表单中的浏览功能从模块化通道的可用模块流列表中选择一个模块。 过程：浏览可用模块流 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到您的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLM 项目。 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 单击浏览可用模块以查看所有模块化通道。 选择一个通道以浏览模块和流： 在模块名称字段中，开始键入要搜索的模块名称，或者从列表中选择。 在流字段中，开始键入要搜索的流名称，或者从列表中选择。 只能在浏览模块时选择通道。选定的通道不会与过滤器一起保存，并且不会对 CLM 过程产生任何影响。 您可以为要包含在目标软件源中的任何其他模块流创建额外的 AppStream 过滤器。会自动包含选定流所依赖的任何模块流。 请小心不要指定有冲突的、不兼容的或缺失的模块流。例如，从同一个模块中选择两个流是无效的。 过程：禁用模块化 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到您的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 CLM 项目。 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择无（禁用模块化）。 单击 保存 以创建新过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，选择您的新 AppStream 过滤器，然后单击 保存。 这样会有效从目标软件源中去除模块元数据，并排除属于模块的所有软件包。 当您使用 Web UI 中的 构建 按钮构建 CLM 项目时，目标软件源是不包含任何模块的常规软件源，其中包含来自选定模块流的软件包。 在 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 项目中完全禁用模块化可能导致环境存在缺陷，因为在 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 中，某些模块对于系统的健康运行是不可或缺的。","title":"内容生命周期管理示例","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

构建内容生命周期项目 5. 升级环境 6. 将客户端指派到环境 内容生命周期管理允许您在更新生产客户端之前自定义和测试软件包。如果您需要在有限的维护时段内应用更新，此功能将特别有用。 内容生命周期管理允许您选择软件通道作为源、根据环境的需要调整软件通道，并在安装到生产客户端之前对其进行全面的测试。 虽然您无法直接修改供应商通道，但可以克隆它们，然后通过添加或去除软件包和自定义补丁来修改克隆版本。可以将这些克隆的通道指派到测试客户端，以确保它们按预期工作。然后，在所有测试通过后，可以将它们升级到生产服务器。 此功能是通过一系列环境实现的，软件通道在其生命周期内可以在这些环境之间转移。大多数环境生命周期至少包括测试和生产环境，但您可以创建任意所需数量的环境。 本章介绍基本的内容生命周期过程以及可用的过滤器。有关更具体的示例，请参见 内容生命周期管理示例。 要设置内容生命周期，需要从一个项目开始。该项目定义软件通道源、用于查找软件包的过滤器，以及构建环境。 过程：创建内容生命周期项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目并单击 创建项目。 在 标签字段中输入项目的标签。 标签字段仅接受小写字母、数字、句点、连字符和下划线。 在名称字段中输入项目的描述性名称。 单击 创建 按钮以创建项目并返回项目页面。 单击 挂接/分离源。 在源对话框中选择源类型，然后选择项目的基础通道。 此时会显示所选基础通道的可用子通道，包括有关通道是必需通道还是建议通道的信息。 选中所需的子通道，然后单击 保存 返回项目页面。 您选择的软件通道现在应会显示出来。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 在筛选器对话框中，选择要挂接到项目的过滤器。 要创建新过滤器，请单击 创建新过滤器。 单击 添加环境。 在环境生命周期对话框中，为第一个环境指定名称、标签和说明，然后单击 保存。 标签字段仅接受小写字母、数字、句点、连字符和下划线。 继续创建环境，直到为整个生命周期创建了所有环境。 可以选择环境在生命周期中的顺序，方法是在创建某个环境时在在前面插入字段中选择该环境。 Uyuni 允许您创建各种类型的过滤器来控制用于构建项目的内容。使用过滤器可以选择要在构建中包含或排除哪些软件包。例如，可以排除所有内核软件包，或仅包含某些软件包的特定发行版。 支持的过滤器为： 软件包过滤 按名称 按名称、纪元、版本、发行版和体系结构 按提供的名称 补丁过滤 按建议名称 按建议类型 按摘要 按关键字 按日期 按受影响的软件包 模块 按流 在内容过滤期间不会解析软件包依赖项。 可以将多个匹配器与过滤器配合使用。哪些匹配器可用取决于所选的过滤器类型。 可用的匹配器为： 包含 匹配（必须采用正则表达式形式） 等于 大于 大于或等于 低于或等于 低于 高于或等于 每个过滤器都有一个规则参数，可将此参数设置为允许或拒绝。过滤器的处理方式如下： 如果某个软件包或补丁满足拒绝过滤器的条件，则从结果中排除它。 如果某个软件包或补丁满足允许过滤器的条件，则将它包含在结果中（即使它已由拒绝过滤器排除）。 当您想要使用一般的拒绝过滤器来排除大量软件包或补丁，并想要使用特定的允许过滤器来“挑选”特定的软件包或补丁时，此行为很有用。 内容过滤器在您的组织中是全局性的，并可以在项目之间共享。 如果您的项目已包含构建的源，当您添加环境时，该环境中会自动填充现有内容。内容是从周期中的前一个环境（如果有）提取的。如果前一个环境不存在，则将内容留空，直到再次构建了项目源。 为了帮助为某些常见方案创建过滤器，Uyuni 提供了过滤器模板。应用这些模板有助于提前创建一组针对特定用例定制的过滤器。 本节介绍可用的模板及其用法。 在包含在线增补的项目中，必须排除未来的常规内核软件包，以便仅将在线补丁软件包作为更新提供给客户端。另一方面，仍然必须包含已安装的常规内核软件包以保持系统完整性。 应用此模板会创建三个所需的过滤器来实现以下行为： 允许其中包含与基础内核版本相同的 kernel-default 软件包的补丁 拒绝其中包含 reboot_suggested 关键字的补丁 拒绝其中包含带有名称 installhint(reboot-needed) 的软件包的补丁 有关如何设置在线增补项目的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version。 过程：应用模板 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择根据 SUSE 产品在线增补。 在产品字段中，选择要为其设置在线增补的产品。 在内核字段中，从所选产品的可用版本列表中选择一个内核版本。拒绝后续常规内核补丁的过滤器将基于此版本。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择具有指定前缀的三个过滤器，然后单击 保存。 如果您想要根据特定已注册系统中安装的内核版本设置在线增补项目，可以使用根据系统在线增补模板。 应用此模板会创建三个所需的过滤器来实现以下行为： 允许其中包含与基础内核版本相同的 kernel-default 软件包的补丁 拒绝其中包含 reboot_suggested 关键字的补丁 拒绝其中包含带有名称 installhint(reboot-needed) 的软件包的补丁 有关如何设置在线增补项目的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version。 过程：应用模板 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择根据特定系统在线增补。 在系统字段中，从列表中选择一个系统，或键入系统名称以缩小选项的范围。 在内核字段中，从所选系统上安装的版本列表中选择一个内核版本。拒绝后续常规内核补丁的过滤器将基于此版本。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择具有指定前缀的三个过滤器，然后单击 保存。 如果您想要在项目中包含模块化软件源中提供的所有可用模块，可以使用此过滤器模板自动添加这些模块。 应用后，此模板将为每个模块及其默认流创建一个 AppStream 过滤器。 如果从项目的页面完成此过程，则过滤器将自动添加到项目。否则，创建的过滤器可能会列在内容生命周期 过滤器中，并根据需要添加到任何项目。 可以编辑每个过滤器以选择不同的模块流，或去除所有这些过滤器以从目标软件源中排除该模块。 由于并非所有模块流都相互兼容，因此更改单个流可能会导致无法成功解析模块化依赖关系。如果发生这种情况，项目细节页面中的过滤器窗格会显示描述问题的错误，并且在选择的所有模块都兼容之前，构建按钮将会禁用。 自 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 起，模块便不再具有任何定义的默认流。因此，对 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 源使用此模板将不会有任何效果。 有关如何使用内容生命周期管理设置 AppStream 软件源的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters。 过程：应用模板 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您的项目。 在过滤器部分，单击 挂接/分离过滤器，然后单击 创建新过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择含默认值的 AppStream 模块。 在通道字段中，选择一个模块化通道以从中获取模块。此下拉列表中仅显示模块化通道。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 滚动到过滤器部分以查看新挂接的 AppStream 过滤器。 可以编辑/去除任何一个过滤器以根据您的需要定制项目。 创建项目、定义环境、挂接源和过滤器后，可以首次构建项目。 构建过程会将过滤器应用于挂接的源，并将过滤器克隆到项目中的第一个环境。 可以使用相同的供应商通道作为多个内容项目的源。在这种情况下，Uyuni 不会为每个克隆的通道创建新的补丁克隆版本，而是在所有克隆的通道之间共享一个补丁克隆版本。如果供应商修改了某个补丁（例如，撤回了该补丁，或者更改了补丁中的软件包），则这可能会导致问题。当您构建某个内容项目时，默认情况下，共享克隆补丁的所有通道将与原始通道同步，即使这些共享通道位于内容项目的其他环境中，或者位于您的组织的其他内容项目通道中，也是如此。可以通过在组织设置中关闭自动补丁同步来更改此行为。要在以后为共享补丁的所有通道手动同步补丁，请导航到软件 管理 通道，单击要同步的通道，然后导航到同步子选项卡。即使手动同步补丁，也会影响共享补丁的所有组织通道。 过程：构建内容生命周期项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您要构建的项目。 Make sure you have the environment available before building the project. 查看挂接的源和过滤器，然后单击 构建。 提供版本消息以描述此构建中的更改或更新。 可以在环境生命周期部分监视构建进度。 构建完成后，环境版本号将会加 1，可将构建的源（例如软件通道）指派到您的客户端。 构建项目后，可将构建的源按顺序升级到环境。 过程：升级环境 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您要处理的项目。 在环境生命周期部分，找到要升级到其后继版本的环境，然后单击 升级。 可以在环境生命周期部分监视构建进度。 当您构建和升级内容生命周期项目时，Uyuni 会创建一个软件通道树。要将客户端添加到环境，请使用客户端的系统细节页面中的软件 软件通道将基础通道和子软件通道指派到客户端。 新添加的克隆通道不会自动指派到客户端。如果您添加或升级了源，则需要手动检查并更新您的通道指派。 在将来的版本中，自动指派会添加到 Uyuni。","title":"内容生命周期管理","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

自定义通道使您能够创建自己的软件包和软件源，然后可以使用这些软件包和软件源来更新您的客户端。它们还使您能够在环境中使用第三方供应商提供的软件。 本节提供有关如何创建、管理和删除自定义通道的更多细节。您必须拥有管理员特权才能创建和管理自定义通道。 在创建自定义通道之前，请确定要将其关联到哪个基础通道，以及要为内容使用哪些软件源。 如果您需要将自定义软件包安装在客户端系统上，可以创建自定义子通道来管理它们。需要在 Uyuni Web UI 中创建通道，并为软件包创建软件源，然后将该通道指派到系统。 不要创建其中有软件包与客户端系统不兼容的子通道。 如果您要使用供应商提供的软件包，可以选择供应商通道作为基础通道。或者，选择无以将自定义通道设为基础通道。 过程：创建自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击 创建通道。 在创建软件通道页面上，为您的通道命名（例如 My Tools SLES 15 SP1 x86_64）和标签（例如 my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64）。 标签不能包含空格或大写字母。 在父通道下拉菜单中选择相关的基础通道（例如 SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64）。 确保为软件包选择兼容的父通道。 在体系结构下拉菜单中选择适当的硬件体系结构（例如 x86_64）。 根据环境的需要，在联系方法细节、通道访问控制和 GPG 字段中提供任何附加信息。 单击 创建通道。 自定义通道有时需要额外的安全设置。许多第三方供应商使用 GPG 保护软件包。如果您想要在自定义通道中使用受 GPG 保护的软件包，需要信任用来为元数据签名的 GPG 密钥。然后，可以选中包含已签名的元数据？复选框，以将软件包元数据与受信任的 GPG 密钥进行匹配。 如果远程通道和软件源已使用 GPG 密钥签名，则您可以导入并信任这些 GPG 密钥。例如，从 Uyuni Server 上的命令行执行 spacewalk-repo-sync： /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync -c -t yum 基础 zypper 调用将导入密钥（如果已提供）。Web UI 不提供此功能。 仅当您要镜像的软件源是以特殊方式设置的，并且软件源中的签名旁边提供了“key”时，才可以正常完成此操作。开放式构建服务 (OBS) 生成的所有软件源都是这种情况。对于其他软件源，需要完成特殊的准备步骤（参见下文！）。 当您创建新通道时，默认会选中启用 GPG 检查字段。如果您要将自定义软件包和应用程序添加到您的通道，请务必取消选中此字段，以便能够安装未签名的软件包。如果软件包来自不受信任的源，则禁用 GPG 检查会带来安全风险。 If you are registering traditional Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 clients you might notice errors with unsigned packages. For more information, see 对注册传统 Red Hat 客户端时出现的问题进行查错. 仅当软件源是有效的软件软件源时，才能使用 Web UI 将其添加到 Uyuni。提前检查是否提供了所需的软件源元数据。可以使用 createrepo 和 reprepro 等工具进行这种检查。mgr-push 可帮助您将单个 RPM 推送到通道，而无需创建软件源。有关详细信息，请参见 createrepo_c 和 reprepro 的手册页。 过程：添加软件软件源 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 软件源，然后单击 创建软件源。 在创建软件源页面上，为该软件源指定标签（例如 my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo）。 在软件源 URL 字段中，提供包含 repodata 文件的目录的路径（例如 file:///opt/mytools/）。可以在此字段中使用任何有效寻址协议。 取消选中包含已签名的元数据？复选框。 可选：如果您的软件源需要客户端证书身份验证，请填写 SSL 字段。 单击 创建软件源。 仅当您要镜像的软件源中在签名旁边提供了“key”时，才能正常完成上述过程。OBS 生成的所有软件源都是这种情况，但其他不是由 OBS 提供的操作系统软件源并非如此。 如果您要使用的软件源不包含 GPG 密钥，您可以自己提供一个 GPG 密钥并手动将其导入密钥环。如果您使用 gpg 命令行工具将密钥导入 /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir 密钥环，将永久储存该密钥。即使清理了 chroot 环境，也会持久保存该密钥。 过程：使用 GPG 密钥创建软件软件源 用于将密钥导入 pub 密钥环的 gpg 命令是： gpg --keyring /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --import /path/to/gpg.key gpg --edit-key 使用 uyuni_suite、uyuni_component 和 uyuni_arch 查询参数添加 Debian 非平面软件源。 uyuni_suite 是必需的。在 Debian 文档中，此参数也名为 distribution。使用此参数可以指定 apt 源。如果不提供此参数，则会使用原始方法。如果该参数以 / 结尾，则会将软件源标识为平面软件源。 uyuni_component 是可选的。此参数只能指定一个组件。无法列出组件。一个 apt 源项允许指定多个组件，但对于 Uyuni 无法做到这一点。对此，您必须为每个组件创建单独的软件源。 uyuni_arch 是可选的。如果将其省略，则会使用 SQL 查询为数据库中的通道计算体系结构名称。如果uyuni_arch与通道体系结构不匹配（有时体系结构命名不明确），请显式指定此参数。 下面提供了一些示例： Table 1. Debian 非平面软件源映射 类型 源行/URL apt 源行 deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ URL 映射 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable?uyuni_suite=binary/ apt 源行 deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main URL 映射 https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists?uyuni_suite=stable&uyuni_component=main 在此处查找有关 Debian 软件源定义格式的背景信息。此信息基于 https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Overview。 软件源定义格式如下： deb URI 套件 [组件 1] [组件 2] [...] 例如： deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable main 或 deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ 对于每一对套件和组件，规范定义了一个根据基 URL + 套件 + 组件计算的不同 URL。 过程：将软件源指派到通道 通过导航到软件 管理 通道，单击新建的自定义通道的名称，然后导航到软件源选项卡，将新软件源指派到自定义通道。 确保选中您要指派到通道的软件源，然后单击 更新软件源。 默认情况下，同步过程会立即开始。有关通道同步的详细信息，请参见下文。 过程：将自定义通道添加到激活密钥 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 激活密钥，然后选择要将自定义通道添加到的密钥。 在细节选项卡上的子通道列表中，选择要关联的通道。 如果需要，您可以选择多个通道。 单击 更新激活密钥。 为了避免错过重要更新，SUSE 建议通过远程软件源更改来使您的自定义通道保持最新。 默认情况下，您创建的所有自定义通道将自动同步。具体而言，在以下情况下将发生同步： 在 UI 中或者使用 spacewalk-common-channels 将软件源添加到通道后 在执行日常任务 mgr-sync-refresh-default 的过程中，这将同步您的所有自定义通道和供应商通道。 要禁用此默认行为，请在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中设置： java.unify_custom_channel_management = 0 关闭此属性后，将不会自动执行同步，要使自定义通道保持最新，您需要： 通过导航到同步选项卡并单击 立即同步 来手动同步该通道。 在软件源选项卡中设置自动同步日程安排。 该过程开始后，可通过多种方式检查通道是否已完成同步： 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到管理 安装向导，然后选择产品选项卡。 产品同步时，此对话框将为每个产品显示一个完成栏。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与软件源关联的通道。 导航到软件源 同步选项卡。软件源名称旁边会显示同步状态。 在命令提示符下检查同步日志文件： tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log 每个子通道在同步过程中会生成自身的日志。您需要检查所有基础通道和子通道日志文件，以确保同步完成。 如果您创建新的自定义通道但未从现有通道克隆，则创建的通道不包含任何软件包或补丁。可以使用 Uyuni Web UI 添加所需的软件包和补丁。 自定义通道只能包含克隆的或者自定义的软件包或补丁，并且这些软件包或补丁必须与通道的基础体系结构相匹配。添加到自定义通道的补丁必须适用于通道中的软件包。 过程：将软件包添加到自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到软件包选项卡。 可选：通过导航到列出/去除选项卡查看当前包含在通道中的所有软件包。 通过导航到添加选项卡将新软件包添加到通道。 选择要为其提供软件包的父通道，然后单击 查看软件包 以填充列表。 检查要添加到自定义通道的软件包，然后单击 添加软件包。 如果您觉得选择合适，请单击 确认添加 以将软件包添加到通道。 可选：可以通过导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到软件包 比较选项卡，将当前通道中的软件包与其他通道中的软件包进行比较。 要使两个通道相同，请单击 合并差异 按钮，然后解决任何冲突。 过程：将补丁添加到自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到补丁选项卡。 可选：通过导航到列出/去除选项卡查看当前包含在通道中的所有补丁。 通过导航到添加选项卡，然后选择要添加的补丁类型，将新补丁添加到通道。 选择要为其提供补丁的父通道，然后单击 浏览关联补丁 以填充列表。 检查要添加到自定义通道的补丁，然后单击 确认。 如果您觉得选择合适，请单击 确认 以将补丁添加到通道。 Uyuni 管理员和通道管理员可以更改或删除任何通道。 要授予其他用户更改或删除通道的权限，请导航到软件 管理 通道，然后选择要编辑的通道。导航到管理者选项卡，并选中要向其授予权限的用户。单击 更新 以保存更改。 如果您删除某个已指派到一组客户端的通道，与已删除通道关联的任何客户端的通道状态将立即更新。这是为了确保在软件源文件中准确反映所做的更改。 无法使用 Web UI 删除 Uyuni 通道。只能删除自定义通道。 过程：删除自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后选择要删除的通道。 单击 删除软件通道。 在删除通道页面上，检查您要删除的通道的细节，然后选中取消订阅系统复选框，以从任何可能仍已订阅的系统中去除该自定义通道。 单击 删除通道。 删除通道时，不会自动去除其中的软件包。您无法更新其通道已被删除的软件包。 可以在 Uyuni Web UI 中删除与通道没有关联的软件包。导航到软件 管理 软件包，选中要去除的软件包，然后单击 删除软件包。","title":"自定义通道","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"custom-channels","url":"/uyuni/administration/custom-channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

受限操作会对客户端进行重大修改，可能导致客户端停止运行。受限操作的一些示例包括： 软件包安装 客户端升级 产品迁移 Highstate 应用（针对 Salt 客户端） 非受限制操作属于次要操作，一般认为它们是安全的，不太可能会在客户端上造成问题。非受限操作的一些示例包括： 软件包配置文件更新 硬件刷新 订阅软件通道 在开始之前，必须创建一个要上载的 ical 文件，或链接到 ical 文件以创建日历。可以在您偏好的日历工具（例如 Microsoft Outlook、Google Calendar 或 KOrganizer）中创建 ical 文件。 过程：上载新的维护日历 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到日程安排 维护时段 日历，然后单击 创建。 在日历名称部分，为日历键入一个名称。 提供 ical 文件的 URL，或直接上载该文件。 单击 创建日历 以保存您的日历。 过程：创建新的日程安排 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到日程安排 维护时段 日程安排，然后单击 创建。 在日程安排名称部分，为日程安排键入一个名称。 可选：如果您的 ical 文件包含要应用于多个日程安排的事件，请选中多个。 选择要指派到此日程安排的日历。 单击 创建日程安排 以保存您的日程安排。 过程：将日程安排指派到客户端 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，选择要将日程安排指派到的客户端，找到系统属性面板，然后单击 编辑这些属性。 或者，可以通过系统集管理器指派客户端，方法是导航到系统 系统集管理器并使用其他 维护时段选项卡。 在编辑系统细节页面中，找到维护日程安排字段，然后选择要指派的日程安排的名称。 单击 更新属性 以指派维护日程安排。 当您将新的维护日程安排指派到某个客户端时，可能已经为该客户端安排了一些受限操作，而这些操作现在可能与新的维护日程安排有冲突。如果发生这种情况，Web UI 会显示错误，并且您无法将该日程安排指派到该客户端。要解决此问题，请在指派日程安排时选中 取消受影响的操作 选项。这样就会取消以前安排的与新维护日程安排冲突的所有操作。 创建维护时段后，可以安排要在维护时段内执行的受限操作，例如软件包升级。 过程：安排软件包升级 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，选择要升级的客户端，然后转到软件 软件包 升级选项卡。 从列表中选择要升级的软件包，然后单击 升级软件包。 在维护时段字段中，选择由客户端用来执行升级的维护时段。 单击 确认 以安排软件包升级。 创建日历时，该日历会包含许多事件，这些事件可能是一次性事件，也可能是重复性事件。每个事件包含一个摘要字段。如果您要为一个日历创建多个维护日程安排，可以使用摘要字段为每个日程安排指定事件。 例如，您可能想要为生产服务器创建一个日程安排，并为测试服务器创建另一个日程安排。在这种情况下，可以针对生产服务器的事件指定摘要：生产服务器，并针对测试服务器的事件指定摘要：测试服务器。 日程安排分为两种类型：“单”或“多”。如果您的日历包含应用于多个日程安排的事件，则您必须选择多，并确保根据日历文件中使用的摘要字段为日程安排命名。 过程：创建多日程安排 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到日程安排 维护时段 日程安排，然后单击 创建。 在日程安排名称部分，键入日程安排的名称。 确保此名称与日历的摘要字段匹配。 选中多选项。 选择要指派到此日程安排的日历。 单击 创建日程安排 以保存您的日程安排。 要创建下一个日程安排，请单击 创建。 在日程安排名称部分，键入第二个日程安排的名称。 确保此名称与第二个日历的摘要字段匹配。 选中多选项。 单击 创建日程安排 以保存您的日程安排。 对需要创建的每个日程安排重复上述过程。 本节包含受限和非受限操作的完整列表。 受限操作会对客户端进行重大修改，可能导致客户端停止运行。受限操作只能在维护时段内运行。受限操作包括： 软件包操作（例如安装、更新或去除软件包） 补丁更新 重引导客户端 回滚事务 配置管理更改任务 应用 Highstate（针对 Salt 客户端） 自动安装和重新安装 远程命令 产品迁移 群集操作 对于 Salt 客户端，可以随时通过导航到 Salt 远程命令来直接运行远程命令。无论 Salt 客户端是否处于维护时段，都可以这样做。有关远程命令的详细信息，请参见 操作。 非受限制操作属于次要操作，一般认为它们是安全的，不太可能会在客户端上造成问题。如果某个操作不受限制，则它在定义上就是非受限操作，随时都可以运行。","title":"维护时段","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"maintenance-windows","url":"/uyuni/administration/maintenance-windows.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Understanding PTF packages 2. Installing PTF packages 3. After PTF installation 4. Removing the patched version of a package 5. Removing the patched version of a package on the client SUSE provides temporary fixes for all currently supported solutions shipped directly to its customers. These PTFs (Program Temporary Fixes) are now available as repositories, which can be synced in Uyuni. PTF packages are installed via a proxy package and are named ptf-xxxxxx, where xxxxxx is a number and part of the name of the package, not its version. They will depend on the correct version of the package that is known to include the correction in the software. This type of package: cannot be installed accidentally (i.e. zypper update will never suggest installing them), cannot be removed accidentally (i.e. a newer package version will not replace the PTF one, unless the user makes it explicitly on the zypper command line), is only updated when the newer version is known to address the specific issue previously solved by the PTF, updates only packages already installed on the system (i.e. if a software is split into multiple packages, the PTF will replace only those currently installed on the system). The correct ID of the package will be provided by SUSE Support during the course of the support case investigation, along with instruction on how to deploy/restart the affected services. PTF packages are currently only supported for SLE 12 and SLE 15 based systems. Other versions or Operating Systems do not have this feature yet and the pages are not visible for them. Procedure: Enable and Synchronize PTF repositories using the command line On the console enter mgr-sync refresh. Enter mgr-sync list channel and look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. E.g. a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Enable the PTF channel with mgr-sync add channel . Now this channel is available and can be added to every system which is using the same base channel. PTF packages need to be installed explicitly, since they are not automatically picked up when updating a system. The SUSE Customer Support will provide the PTF number to fix a specific problem. With the number the proxy package can be identified in the PTF list. In Uyuni Web UI every system with PTFs available for installation has a page which lists them. Procedure: Enable and Synchronize PTF repositories via the Uyuni Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Products and look for the product you want to enable the PTF repository for. Click Show product’s channels next to the products sync status. You should see a popup listing mandatory and optional channels for the product. In the optional channels list look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. E.g. a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Select the channel using the checkbox next to its name and click Confirm to schedule the sync. Note that the product has to be installed to be able to add optional channels to it. Procedure: Installation of PTF packages In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client where you want to install a PTF. Navigate to the Systems Software Packages Software Channels and select the PTF channel. 单击 下一步，然后单击 确认 [guimenu]````以确认软件通道更改。 To check if the channel assignment is finished, navigate to Systems Events History to see the results. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs Install sub tab. Select the ptf package you want to install. Click Install PTF, and Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Installation with Confirm. To see PTF installation results, navigate to Systems Events History. In case a PTF should be installed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageInstall API can be used with the proxy package name. Once a PTF is confirmed to address the reported issue, the updated package will be tracked for inclusion into a future maintenance update before being widely distributed as an regular maintenance update in the update repositories. When this regular update with the fix is released, an updated version of the PTF will also be released into the account-specific PTF repository. The updated PTF will remove the strict dependencies and allow updates to be installed again. The replacement of the PTF with the maintenance update which includes the fix happens automatically via a standard package update or patch installation. In cases where a PTF needs to be uninstalled and the non-patched version of the packages need to be installed on the system, a simple package remove cannot be used. The ptf package is not selectable in the standard package list page. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client you want to remove a PTF from. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs List/Remove sub tab. Select the ptf package you want to remove. Click Remove PTFs, and on the Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Removal page click Confirm. To see the results, navigate to Systems Events History. Removing PTFs requires a special version of libzypp and zypper to be installed on the client system. Check zypper --help whether removeptf is supported. The List/Remove tab is only visible if this condition is met. In case the PTF should be removed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageRemove api can be used with the proxy package name. In case a PTF should be removed directly on the client using the console, it is required to use a special command zypper removeptf …​. All other ways result either in an error or can lead to unwanted behavior like removing important packages from the system and make the system unusable.

服务器证书的主机名必须与其部署到的计算机的完全限定主机名匹配。可以在证书的 X509v3 Subject Alternative Name 部分中设置主机名。还可以根据环境的需要列出多个主机名。 第三方颁发机构通常使用中间 CA 来为请求的服务器证书签名。在这种情况下，链中的所有 CA 都必须可用。如果没有额外的参数或选项可用于指定中间 CA，请注意所有 CA（根 CA 和中间 CA）都将储存在一个文件中。 Uyuni 默认使用自我签名证书。完成初始设置后，可将默认证书替换为导入的证书。 过程：在新的 Uyuni Server 上导入证书 根据 安装 中的说明安装 Uyuni Server。 根据 SUSE Manager Server 设置 完成初始设置。 在命令提示符下，将 SSL 环境变量指向证书文件位置： export CA_CERT= export SERVER_KEY= export SERVER_CERT= 完成 Uyuni 设置： yast susemanager_setup 在设置过程中，当系统提示您输入证书细节时，请填写随机值。这些值将由您在命令提示符下指定的值覆盖。 在从中导出了环境变量的同一个外壳中执行 yast susemanager_setup 命令。 Uyuni Proxy 默认使用自我签名证书。完成初始设置后，您可以将默认证书替换为导入的证书。 过程：在新的 Uyuni Proxy 上导入证书 根据安装中的说明安装 Uyuni Proxy。 根据SUSE Manager Proxy 设置完成初始设置。 在命令提示符下，运行： configure-proxy.sh 出现您要导入现有证书吗？提示时，键入 y。 按照提示完成设置。 使用同一证书颁发机构为服务器和代理的所有服务器证书签名。使用不同 CA 签名的证书将不匹配。 您可以将 Uyuni 安装中的活动证书替换为新证书。要替换证书，可以将已安装的 CA 证书替换为新 CA，然后更新数据库。 过程：替换现有证书 在 Uyuni Server 上的命令提示符下，调用命令 mgr-ssl-cert-setup 并提供证书作为参数： mgr-ssl-cert-setup --root-ca-file= --server-cert-file= --server-key-file= 中间 CA 可以在使用 --root-ca-file 指定的文件中提供，也可以使用 --intermediate-ca-file 作为附加选项来指定。可以多次指定 --intermediate-ca-file 选项。此命令将对提供的文件执行一些测试，以测试它们是否有效并可用于请求的用例。 重启动服务以应用更改： spacewalk-service stop systemctl restart postgresql.service spacewalk-service start 使用新 CA 更新数据库： /usr/bin/rhn-ssl-dbstore --ca-cert= 如果您使用代理，则需要使用代理的主机名和 cname 为每个代理生成一个服务器证书 RPM。还应在 Uyuni Proxy 上使用 mgr-ssl-cert-setup 来替换证书。由于 Uyuni Proxy 没有 postgreSQL 数据库，因此运行 spacewalk-service restart 就足够了。 如果根 CA 已更改，则需要将其部署到与 Uyuni 连接的所有客户端。 过程：在 Salt 客户端上部署根 CA 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 概览。 选中所有 Salt 客户端以将其添加到系统集管理器。 导航到系统 系统集管理器 概览。 在状态字段中，单击 应用 以应用系统状态。 在 Highstate 页面中，单击 应用 Highstate 以将更改传播到客户端。 传统客户端已弃用，请改用 Salt 客户端。 在仍有传统受管客户端连接到 Uyuni 的情况下，如果需要替换 CA，则需要执行一些额外的步骤。 重要的是，当新 CA 在 Uyuni Server 和 Proxy 上激活时，这些客户端不会断开连接。将旧的和新的根 CA 证书部署到受影响的客户端并信任这些证书。使用配置通道将证书文件部署到客户端，并使用远程命令功能重新生成信任储存。 在 Uyuni Server 和 Proxy 上激活新证书后，测试连接是否正常，以及是否仍然可以在客户端上安排操作。如果一切正常，则可以从客户端中去除旧的根 CA。","title":"导入 SSL

Uyuni Server 的客户端将通过验证服务器证书来检查它是否连接到正确的服务器。此过程称为 SSL 握手。 在 SSL 握手期间，客户端将检查服务器证书中的主机名是否与预期相符。客户端还需要检查服务器证书是否受信任。 证书颁发机构 (CA) 是用于为其他证书签名的证书。所有证书必须由证书颁发机构 (CA) 签名，只有这样，才会将它们视为有效，并且客户端才能成功地匹配它们。 为使 SSL 身份验证能够正常进行，客户端必须信任根 CA。这意味着必须在每个客户端上安装根 CA。 默认的 SSL 身份验证方法是让 Uyuni 使用自我签名证书。在这种情况下，Uyuni 已生成所有证书，并且根 CA 已直接为服务器证书签名。 另一种方法是使用中间 CA。在这种情况下，根 CA 为中间 CA 签名。然后中间 CA 可为任意数量的其他中间 CA 签名，而最后一个中间 CA 为服务器证书签名。这称为链式证书。 如果您在链式证书中使用中间 CA，则根 CA 将安装在客户端上，而服务器证书则安装在服务器上。在 SSL 握手期间，客户端必须能够校验根 CA 与服务器证书之间的整个中间证书链，因此它们必须能够访问所有中间证书。 可以通过两种主要方式实现此目的。在较旧版本的 Uyuni 中，所有中间 CA 默认都安装在客户端上。但是，您也可以在服务器上配置服务以将其提供给客户端。在这种情况下，在 SSL 握手期间，服务器会提供服务器证书以及所有中间 CA。此机制现已用作新的默认配置。 Uyuni 默认使用没有中间 CA 的自我签名证书。为了提高安全性，您可以安排一个第三方 CA 来为您的证书签名。第三方 CA 执行检查以确保证书中包含的信息正确。他们通常针对此项服务收取年费。使用第三方 CA 可以提高证书的伪造难度，并为安装提供附加的保护。如果您的证书已由第三方 CA 签名，您可以将其导入 Uyuni 安装中。 本手册分 2 个步骤介绍 SSL 证书的用法 如何使用 Uyuni 工具创建自我签名证书 如何在 Uyuni Server 或 Proxy 上部署证书 如果证书由第三方实例（例如自有或外部的 PKI）提供，则可以跳过步骤 1。 有关如何创建自我签名证书的详细信息，请参见

客户端搭配使用可确保您的客户端拥有正确的软件权利、可连接到适当的通道以及订阅相关的组。每个激活密钥都绑定到一个组织，您可以在创建密钥时设置此项。 在 Uyuni 中，激活密钥是一组带有标签的配置设置。您可以通过将某个激活密钥的标签作为参数添加到引导脚本，来应用与该激活密钥关联的所有配置设置。我们建议您结合引导脚本来使用激活密钥标签。当执行引导脚本时，与该标签关联的所有配置设置都将应用到运行脚本的系统上。 激活密钥可以指定以下各项： 通道指派 系统类型或附加权利 联系方法 配置文件 要安装的软件包 系统组 在注册客户端时需使用激活密钥，之后将不再使用。无论激活密钥指定了什么内容，注册好客户端后，就能以任何方式对其进行更改。记录激活密钥与客户端之间的关联仅为了历史记载。 过程：创建激活密钥 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，以管理员身份导航到系统 激活密钥。 单击 创建密钥 按钮。 在激活密钥细节页面的说明字段中，输入激活密钥的说明。 在密钥字段中，输入激活密钥的名称。 例如，SLES15-SP4 表示 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4。 对于任何 SUSE 产品，请不要在密钥字段中使用逗号或双引号。不过，对于 Red Hat 产品，则 必须 使用逗号。 所有其他字符均可使用，不过系统会自动去除 <> (){}（包括空格）。 如果将字段留空，系统会生成一个随机字符串。 在基础通道下拉框中，选择适当的基础软件通道，并允许填充相关子通道。 有关详细信息，请参见 reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc#vle.webui. admin.wizard.products 和 自定义通道。 选择所需的子通道（例如，必需的 SUSE Manager 工具和更新通道）。 如果需要启用任何选项，请选中附加系统类型复选框。 建议您保留默认设置的联系方法。 建议您将统一默认设置保留未选中状态。 单击 创建激活密钥 以创建激活密钥。 选中配置文件部署复选框以对此密钥启用配置管理，然后单击 更新激活密钥 保存此更改。 在您创建激活密钥前，配置文件部署复选框将不会显示。如果您需要启用配置管理，请务必返回并选中该复选框。 在传统客户端上执行引导脚本时，可以组合多个激活密钥。组合密钥可让您更好地控制系统上可以安装哪些产品，并可减少大型或复杂环境密钥的重复几率。 组合激活密钥仅可用于传统客户端。Salt 客户端不支持组合激活密钥。如果您对 Salt 客户端使用组合密钥，系统只会使用第一个密钥。 您可以在命令提示符处或在单个自动安装配置文件中指定多个激活密钥。 在 Uyuni 服务器的命令提示符处，使用 rhnreg_ks 命令并用逗号分隔密钥名称。要在 Kickstart 配置文件中指定多个密钥，请导航到系统 自动安装，然后编辑您要使用的配置文件。 在组合激活密钥时需小心，因为如果某些值相互冲突，则可能会导致客户端注册失败。开始前，请检查以下值，确保它们未包含冲突信息： 软件包 软件子通道 配置通道。 如果检测到冲突，系统的处理方式如下： 基础软件通道中的冲突：注册失败。 系统类型中的冲突：注册失败。 启用配置 标志中的冲突：启用配置管理。 如果其中一个密钥为系统特定密钥：注册失败。 重新激活密钥可用来重新注册客户端并重新获得所有 Uyuni 设置，但只能使用一次。重新激活密钥为客户端特定密钥，包含系统 ID、历史记录、组和通道。 要创建重新激活密钥，请导航到系统，单击要为其创建重新激活密钥的客户端，然后导航到细节 重新激活选项卡。单击 生成新密钥 以创建重新激活密钥。记录密钥细节以供日后使用。与未与特定系统 ID 关联的典型激活密钥不同，此处创建的密钥不会显示在系统 激活密钥页面中。 对于 Salt 客户端，当您创建重新激活密钥后，可在 /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf 中将其作为 management_key grain 使用。例如： grains: susemanager: management_key: \"re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e\" 重启动 salt-minion 进程以应用重新激活密钥。 您可以结合引导脚本来使用重新激活密钥。有关引导脚本的详细信息，请参见 使用引导脚本注册客户端。 对于传统客户端，当您创建重新激活密钥后，可结合 rhnreg_ks 命令行实用程序使用该密钥。此命令会重新注册客户端并恢复其 Uyuni 设置。在传统客户端上，您可以将重新激活密钥与激活密钥进行合并，以便为单个系统配置文件聚合多个密钥的设置。例如： rhnreg_ks --server=/XMLRPC \\ --activationkey=, \\ --force 如果您使用客户端现有的 Uyuni 配置文件自动安装客户端，该配置文件会使用重新激活密钥来重新注册系统并恢复其设置。请勿在正在进行基于配置文件的自动安装时重新生成、删除或使用此密钥， 否则会导致自动安装失败。 默认父通道 避免使用 SUSE Manager Default 父通道。此设置会强制 Uyuni 选择与所安装操作系统最匹配的父通道，而这有时可能会导致非预期的行为。请改为创建特定于每个发行套件和体系结构的激活密钥。 使用激活密钥引导 如果您要使用引导脚本，请考虑为每个脚本创建一个激活密钥。这有助于您调整通道指派、软件包安装、系统组成员资格和配置通道指派。注册后，您需要与系统手动交互的情形也会减少。 带宽要求 使用激活密钥可能导致在注册时自动下载软件，这对于存在带宽限制的环境来说可能并不适宜。 下列选择会产生带宽用量： 指派 SUSE Product Pool 通道会导致自动安装相应的产品描述符软件包。 安装软件包部分中的所有软件包。 配置部分中的任何 Salt 状态都可能会触发下载，具体视其内容而定。 密钥标签命名 如果您没有为激活密钥输入直观易懂的名称，系统会自动生成一串数字字符串，这会使得您的密钥难以管理。 请考虑为您的激活密钥使用一种命名模式，以方便您进行跟踪。设计与您组织的基础结构相关的名称有助于您更轻松地执行较复杂的操作。 在创建密钥标签时，请考虑以下提示： 操作系统命名（必需）：密钥应始终代表提供的设置所适用的操作系统 体系结构命名（建议）：除非您的公司仅在一个体系结构上运行（例如 x86_64），否则最好提供含体系结构类型的标签。 服务器类型命名：此服务器的用途是什么？ 位置命名：服务器位于何处？机房、建筑物或部门？ 日期命名：维护时段、季度等。 自定义命名：哪种命名模式符合您组织的需求？ 激活密钥标签名称示例： sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le 包含的通道 在创建激活密钥时，您还需要注意哪些软件通道与其关联。应为密钥指派特定的基础通道， 不建议使用默认基础通道。有关详细信息，请在 客户端注册 中查看您要安装的客户端操作系统。","title":"激活密钥","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"activation-keys","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/activation-keys.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

另一个方法是使用特定于发行套件的机制： 对于 SUSE 系统，请使用 KIWI 准备 ISO 映像。有关信息，请参见使用 KIWI 构建 SUSE ISO 映像。 对于 Red Hat 系统，请使用 mkisofs。有关信息，请参见使用 mkisofs 构建 RedHat ISO 映像。 在所有情况下，您都需要使用生成的映像刻录 CD-ROM 或准备 USB 密钥。 Cobbler 可创建包含一组发行套件、内核和菜单的 ISO 引导映像，该映像的工作方式与 PXE 安装类似。 IBM Z 上不支持使用 Cobbler 构建 ISO。 与通过 PXE 进行网络引导类似，为了使用 Cobbler 准备 ISO 映像，您需要准备发行套件和配置文件。有关创建发行套件的信息，请参见 可自动安装的发行套件。有关创建配置文件的信息，请参见 自动安装配置文件。 The Cobbler buildiso command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO. Specifying the distribution with --distro is mandatory when running buildiso command. cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro= You must use distro and profile labels as listed by Cobbler, and not simply as shown in the UI. To list the names of distributions and profiles stored by Cobbler, run the commands: # cobbler distro list # cobbler profile list 引导 ISO 默认包含所有配置文件和系统。您可以通过 --profiles 和 --systems 选项来限制使用的配置文件和系统。例如： cobbler buildiso --systems=\"system1 system2 system3\" \\ --profiles=\" --distro=\" 如果您无法将 ISO 映像写入到公共 tmp 目录,请检查 /usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.service 中的 systemd 设置。 KIWI 是一个映像创建系统。您可以使用 KIWI 创建供目标系统用于安装 SUSE 系统的可引导 ISO 映像。重引导或打开系统时，它会从映像引导，从 Uyuni 装载 AutoYaST 配置，并根据 AutoYaST 配置文件安装 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server。 要使用 ISO 映像，请引导系统并在提示符处键入 autoyast（假设您将 AutoYaST 引导的标签保留为 autoyast）。按 kbd: [Enter] 开始 AutoYaST 安装。 有关 KIWI 的详细信息，请参见 http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/。 您可以使用 mkisofs 创建供目标系统用于安装 Red Hat 系统的可引导 ISO 映像。重引导或打开系统时，它会从映像引导，从 Uyuni 装载 Kickstart 配置，并根据 Kickstart 配置文件安装 Red Hat Enterprise Linux。 过程：使用 mkisofs 构建可引导 ISO 复制目标发行套件第一个 CD-ROM 中 /isolinux 的内容。 编辑 isolinux.cfg 文件，使其默认指向 'ks'。将 'ks' 部分更改为： label ks kernel vmlinuz append text ks=`url` initrd=initrd.img lang= devfs=nomount \\ ramdisk_size=16438 `ksdevice` 基于 IP 地址的 Kickstart URL 如下所示： http://`my.manager.server`/kickstart/ks/mode/ip_range 通过 IP 范围定义的 Kickstart 发行套件应与您要基于其构建的发行套件匹配，以免发生错误。 可选：如果您要使用 ksdevice，相应命令如下所示： ksdevice=eth0 可以通过指定新的发行套件标签，更改某个系列中 kickstart 配置文件的发行套件，例如将 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4 更改为 Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 4。请注意，您无法在两个版本（从 4 到 5）或两个更新（从 U1 到 U2）之间移动。 根据需要进一步自定义 isolinux.cfg。例如，您可以添加多个选项、不同的引导消息或较短的超时期限。 使用以下命令创建 ISO： mkisofs -o file.iso -b isolinux.bin -c boot.cat -no-emul-boot \\ -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -R -J -v -T isolinux/ 请注意，isolinux/ 是从发行套件 CD 中复制且经过修改的 isolinux 文件所在目录的相对路径，而 file.iso 是输出 ISO 文件，位于当前目录中。 将 ISO 刻录到 CD-ROM 并插入磁盘。或者，准备 USB 密钥并插入。 引导系统并在提示符处键入 ks（如果您将 Kickstart 引导的标签保留为“ks”）。 按 Enter 启动 Kickstart。","title":"通过 CD-ROM 或 USB 密钥安装","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-cdrom","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-cdrom.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 使用 Cobbler 构建 ISO 映像","hash":"build-iso-with-cobbler","id":1},{"text":"2. 使用 KIWI 构建 SUSE ISO 映像","hash":"build-iso-with-kiwi","id":2},{"text":"3. 使用 mkisofs 构建 RedHat ISO 映像","hash":"build-iso-with-mkisofs","id":3}]},"50":{"id":50,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 基于 ISO 映像的发行套件 2. 基于 RPM 软件包的发行套件 3. 声明可自动安装的发行套件 自动安装过程依赖于几个文件来启动安装。这些文件包括 Linux 内核、初始 RAM 磁盘和在安装模式下引导操作系统所需的其他文件。 您可以从 DVD 映像中提取所需的文件。有关信息，请参见 基于 ISO 映像的发行套件。 或者，您也可以安装 tftpboot-installation 软件包。有关信息，请参见基于 RPM 软件包的发行套件。 对于与这些文件相同的操作系统版本，您还必须在 Uyuni 服务器上同步基础通道。 当您准备好文件并已同步基础通道时，您需要声明发行套件。此操作会将安装文件关联到基础通道。发行套件可能会由一个或多个安装配置文件引用。有关信息，请参见声明可自动安装的发行套件。 此方法假设您有要在客户端上安装的操作系统的安装媒体。这通常是 DVD .iso 映像，其中包含 Linux 内核、initrd 文件和在安装模式下引导操作系统所需的其他文件。 过程：从安装媒体导入文件 将安装媒体复制到您的 Uyuni 服务器上。对于 SUSE 操作系统，您可以从 https://www.suse.com/download/下载安装媒体。 以循环方式挂载 ISO 映像，并将其内容复制到某处： # mount -o loop,ro .iso /mnt # mkdir -p /srv/www/distributions # cp -a /mnt /srv/www/distributions/ # umount /mnt Take a note of the file path.

服务器还可以向客户端提供其他配置信息，例如主机名、路由器的地址和域名服务器的地址。自动安装可能需要其中某些信息，例如，当您通过域名指定安装服务器时。 在 PXE 引导菜单中，第一个选项是本地引导。如果选择此选项，将从本地磁盘驱动器继续引导过程。如果一段时间后未选择任何配置文件，系统会自动选择此选项。这是一种安全措施，用于防止在没有操作人员选择其中一个配置文件时启动自动安装。 安装也可以从其中一个配置文件自动启动，而无需手动干预。这称为“无人照管的置备”。 “裸机”功能是一种基于 PXE 引导的无人照管置备。在这种情况下，引导加载程序文件只会在 Uyuni 服务器中注册客户端，而不启动安装。您可以稍后触发就地重新安装。 过程：通过 PXE 引导安装 准备 DHCP 服务器，请参见准备 DHCP 服务器。 准备可自动安装的发行套件，请参见 可自动安装的发行套件。

DHCP 配置文件，使其指向作为 TFTP 引导服务器的安装服务器。 例如：配置 ISC DHCP 服务器 在 DHCP 服务器上，以 root 身份打开 /etc/dhcpd.conf 文件。 修改您的客户端的声明： host myclient { (...) next-server 192.168.2.1; filename \"pxelinux.0\"; } 保存文件并重启动 dhcpd 服务。 此示例将 PXE 客户端 myclient 定向到 192.168.2.1 处的安装服务器，并指示其检索 pxelinux.0 引导加载程序文件。 或者，如果您的 DHCP 服务器已在 Uyuni 中注册，则可以改为使用 DHCPd 公式来配置： 例如：使用 DHCPd 公式配置 ISC DHCP 服务器 导航到系统 系统列表，选择要更改的客户端，然后转到公式选项卡以启用 DHCPd 公式。 转到公式的 Dhcpd 选项卡，并在下一台服务器字段中输入安装服务器的主机名或 IP 地址。 在文件名 EFI 字段中，键入 grub/grub.efi 以启用 EFI PXE 支持。 在文件名字段中，键入 pxelinux.0 以启用旧式 BIOS 支持。 单击 保存公式 以保存您的配置。 应用 Highstate。 如果使用安全引导，请在文件名 EFI 字段中键入

SUSE Linux Enterprise 客户端的 Unified Installer 更新通道 通道是一种用于对软件包分组的方法。软件包由软件源提供，而软件源与通道关联。客户端订阅软件通道后，便可安装并更新与其关联的任何软件。 在 Uyuni 中，通道分为基础通道和子通道。以此方式组织通道可确保每个系统上只安装兼容的软件包。客户端只能订阅一个基础通道，该通道是在注册期间根据客户端操作系统和体系结构指派的。对于供应商提供的付费通道，您必须具有关联的订阅。 基础通道中包含为特定操作系统类型、版本和体系结构构建的软件包。例如，SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86-64 基础通道中仅包含与该操作系统和体系结构兼容的软件。 子通道与基础通道关联，仅提供与基础通道兼容的软件包。一个系统可订阅其基础通道的多个子通道。将系统指派到基础通道后，该系统便只能安装相关的子通道。例如，如果将系统指派到 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86_64 基础通道，那么便只能安装或更新通过兼容基础通道或它的任何关联子通道提供的软件包。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，您可以导航到软件 通道列表 所有来浏览可用通道。您可以通过导航到软件 管理 通道修改或创建新通道。 有关使用通道（包括自定义通道）的详细信息，请参见 通道管理。 SUSE Package Hub 是 SUSE Linux Enterprise 产品的扩展，用于提供额外的开源软件（由 openSUSE 社区提供）。 SUSE Package Hub 中的软件包由 openSUSE 社区提供。SUSE 不会为这些软件包提供支持。 如果您在客户端上使用的是 SUSE Linux Enterprise 操作系统，则可启用 SUSE Package Hub 扩展来访问这些额外的软件包。这样会提供 SUSE Package Hub 通道，您可以为客户端订阅这些通道。 SUSE Package Hub 提供了大量软件包，可能需要花很长时间进行同步，并会占用大量磁盘空间。除非您确实需要 SUSE Package Hub 提供的软件包，否则请不要启用它。 为了避免无意间安装或更新不支持的软件包，建议您实施一开始会拒绝所有 SUSE Package Hub 软件包的内容生命周期管理策略。然后，您可以显式启用所需的特定软件包。有关内容生命周期管理的详细信息，请参见 内容生命周期管理。 对于基于 Red Hat 的客户端，通过 AppStream 来提供额外的软件包。大多数情况下都需要 AppStream 软件包来确保您已拥有所有必需的软件。 当您在 Uyuni Web UI 中管理 AppStream 软件包时，您可能会注意到系统会显示相互矛盾的软件包更新建议。这是由于 Uyuni 无法正确解释模块化元数据。您可以使用内容生命周期管理 (CLM) AppStream 过滤器将 AppStream 软件源转换为非模块化软件源，以在执行某些升级操作时使用。有关 CLMR AppStream 过滤器的详细信息，请参见 内容生命周期管理示例。 对于基于 Red Hat 的客户端，通过 EPEL 提供额外的软件包（适用于企业版 Linux 的额外软件包）。EPEL 是可选软件包软件源，用于提供额外的软件。 EPEL 中的软件包由 Fedora 社区提供。SUSE 不会为这些软件包提供支持。 如果您在客户端上使用的是 Red Hat 操作系统，则可启用 EPEL 扩展来访问这些额外的软件包。这样会提供 EPEL 通道，您可以为客户端订阅这些通道。 EPEL 提供了大量软件包，可能需要花很长时间进行同步，并会占用大量磁盘空间。除非您确实需要 EPEL 提供的软件包，否则请不要启用 EPEL 软件源。 为了避免无意间安装或更新不支持的软件包，建议您实施一开始会拒绝所有 EPEL 软件包的内容生命周期管理 (CLM) 策略。然后，您可以显式启用所需的特定软件包。有关内容生命周期管理的详细信息，请参见 内容生命周期管理。 Unified Installer 使用此通道来确保其在安装操作系统前是最新的。所有 SUSE Linux Enterprise 产品在安装期间都应能够访问安装程序更新通道。 对于 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 客户端，默认会在您添加包含安装程序更新通道的产品时对这些通道进行同步，并会在您创建包含这些产品通道的可自动安装发行套件时予以启用。 对于所有其他 SUSE Linux Enterprise 变体，包括 SUSE Linux Enterprise for SAP，您必须手动添加安装程序更新通道。要完成此操作，请克隆这些 SUSE Linux Enterprise 变体的基础通道下的相应 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 安装程序更新通道。克隆通道后，为这些 SUSE Linux Enterprise 变体创建可自动安装的发行套件时，会自动使用相应通道。","title":"软件通道","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"channels","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 通过 SUSE Package Hub 提供的软件包","hash":"_通过_suse_package_hub_提供的软件包","id":1},{"text":"2. 通过 AppStream 提供的软件包","hash":"_通过_appstream_提供的软件包","id":2},{"text":"3. 通过 EPEL 提供的软件包","hash":"_通过_epel_提供的软件包","id":3},{"text":"4.

Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. 有关 GPG 密钥的详细信息，请参见 GPG 密钥。 Debian 客户端可能需要安装多个 GPG 密钥。 同步第三方 Debian 软件源时，您需要在服务器上导入相应的 GPG 密钥。如果缺少 GPG 密钥，同步将会失败。 使用 Debian 软件源时，系统只会对元数据签名。因此不需要导入软件通道的 GPG 密钥。Uyuni 将不会对软件包重新签名。 要查看已导入 Uyuni 服务器的 GPG 密钥，请运行以下命令： sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys 要导入新的 GPG 密钥，请使用 --import 参数： sudo gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --import .gpg 默认会为 Debian 上的 root 用户禁用 SSH 访问权限。 要想能够使用普通用户进行初始配置，您需要编辑 sudoers 文件。 过程：向 Root 用户授予访问权限 在客户端上，编辑 sudoers 文件： sudo visudo 在 sudoers 文件末尾添加下面一行，以向用户授予 sudo 访问权限。以在 Web UI 中引导客户端的用户的名称替换 ： ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 此过程无需口令便可授予 root 访问权限，而注册客户端需要提供口令。客户端成功安装后会以 root 特权运行，因此将不再需要该访问权限。客户端成功安装之后，建议您从 sudoers 文件中去除该行。 要注册您的 Debian 客户端，需要有引导软件源。默认会每天重新生成引导软件源。您可以在命令提示符处使用以下命令手动创建引导软件源： mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 对于 Debian 10，出现提示时请选择 debian10-amd64-uyuni。 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。","title":"注册 Debian 客户端","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-debian","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-debian.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 准备注册","hash":"_准备注册","id":1},{"text":"2. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":2},{"text":"3. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":3},{"text":"4. 管理 GPG 密钥","hash":"_管理_gpg_密钥","id":4},{"text":"5.

Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. openSUSE Leap Micro clients require reboot after registering. Reboot is automatically scheduled after registration is completed, but it is respecting the default reboot manager maintenance window. This window may be several hours after the client is registered. To speed up openSUSE Leap Micro registration, manually reboot the client after the registration script finishes. To register openSUSE Leap Micro clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using the command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo For more information on registering clients, see 客户端注册.","title":"Registering openSUSE Leap Micro Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-opensuseleapmicro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-opensuseleapmicro.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":1},{"text":"2. 注册客户端","hash":"_注册客户端","id":2}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 添加软件通道 2. 检查同步状态 3. 创建激活密钥 4. 管理 GPG 密钥 5. 注册客户端 本节包含有关注册运行 Oracle Linux 操作系统的传统客户端和 Salt 客户端的信息。 Traditional clients are not available on Oracle Linux 9 and 8.

Traditional clients are available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 only. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 clients are supported as Salt clients. 如果您是在公有云（例如 Amazon EC2）中运行客户端，请使用此方法。 可以将 RHUI 与 Red Hat 内容分发网络 (CDN) 搭配使用来管理您的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 订阅。有关使用 Red Hat CDN 的信息，请参见 使用 CDN 注册 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 客户端。 You are responsible for connecting Uyuni Server to the Red Hat update infrastructure. All clients that get updates using this RHUI certificate need to be correctly licensed, please check with your cloud provider and the Red Hat terms of service for more information. 当使用 RHUI 注册的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 客户端关闭时，Red Hat 可能会声称证书无效。在此情况下，您需要再次打开客户端，或获取新的 RHUI 证书。 Red Hat 客户端需要 Red Hat 证书颁发机构 (CA) 和权利证书以及权利密钥。 Red Hat 客户端使用 URL 来复制软件源。URL 更改取决于 Red Hat 客户端是在何处注册的。 Red Hat 客户端可通过三种方式注册： redhat.com 上的 Red Hat 内容分发网络 (CDN) Red Hat 从属服务器 云中的 Red Hat 更新基础结构 (RHUI) 本指南将介绍注册到 Red Hat 更新基础结构 (RHUI) 的客户端。您至少须有一个注册到 RHUI 的系统并拥有授权订阅，以获得软件源内容。 而有关使用 Red Hat 内容分发网络 (CDN) 的信息，请参见 使用 CDN 注册 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 客户端。 要为客户端系统使用从属证书，必须有从属服务器和订阅。Uyuni 服务器不支持使用从属证书的客户端。 The entitlement certificates and keys need to be copied from the client system to a location that your web browser can access. 密钥和证书的名称可能与此处所示的名称略有不同。您的权利证书和 Red Hat CA 证书文件的文件扩展名为 .crt。密钥的文件扩展名为 .key。 过程：将证书复制到服务器 Copy your entitlement certificate and key from the client system, to your workstation: Amazon EC2 cp /etc/pki/rhui/product/content-.crt //entitlement/ cp /etc/pki/rhui/content-.key //entitlement/ Azure 使用以下命令检查证书链： openssl s_client -connect rhui-1.microsoft.com:443 -showcerts 示例输出如下所示： CONNECTED(00000003) depth=2 C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Global Root G2 verify return:1 depth=1 C = US, O = Microsoft Corporation, CN = Microsoft Azure TLS Issuing CA 06 verify return:1 depth=0 C = US, ST = WA, L = Redmond, O = Microsoft Corporation, CN = rhui-1.microsoft.com verify return+ Check the second certificate (CN = Microsoft Azure), if it is the same on your VM, note the certificate name. Refer to the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/certificate-authorities to download the certificate. Click the AIA link to download the certificate. The certificate will be downloaded with the .cer suffix. Convert it to .crt with the command: openssl x509 -inform DER -in -out Google Cloud Platform cp /etc/pki/rhui/product/content.crt //entitlement/ cp /etc/pki/rhui/key.pem //entitlement/ 将客户端系统中的 Red Hat CA 证书文件复制到权利证书和密钥所在的相同位置： Amazon EC2 cp /etc/pki/rhui/cdn.redhat.com-chain.crt //entitlement Azure 将转换后的证书上载到 //entitlement Google Cloud Platform cp /etc/pki/rhui/ca.crt //entitlement To manage repositories on your Red Hat client, you need to import the CA and entitlement certificates to the Uyuni Server. This requires that you perform the import procedure three times, to create three entries, one of each for the entitlement certificate, the entitlement key, and the Red Hat certificate. 过程：将证书导入服务器 在 Uyuni 服务器 Web UI 上，导航到系统 自动安装 GPG 和 SSL 密钥。 单击 创建储存的密钥/证书，并为权利证书设置下列参数： 在说明字段中，键入 Entitlement-Cert-Date。 在类型字段中，选择 SSL。 在选择要上载的文件字段中，浏览到您保存权利证书的位置，然后选择 .crt 证书文件。 单击 创建密钥。 单击 创建储存的密钥/证书，并为权利密钥设置下列参数： 在说明字段中，键入 Entitlement-Key-Date。 在类型字段中，选择 SSL。 在选择要上载的文件字段中，浏览到您保存权利密钥的位置，然后选择 .key 密钥文件。 单击 创建密钥。 单击 创建储存的密钥/证书，并为 Red Hat 证书设置下列参数： 在说明字段中，键入 redhat-cert。 在类型字段中，选择 SSL。 在选择要上载的文件字段中，浏览到您保存 Red Hat 证书的位置，然后选择证书文件。 单击 创建密钥。 将 Red Hat 客户端注册到您的 Uyuni 服务器之前，您需要添加所需的软件通道，并同步这些通道。 下面的小节中的说明通常默认使用 x86_64 体系结构。请根据情况将其替换为其他体系结构。 此过程所需的通道包括： Table 1. Red Hat 通道 - CLI OS Version Base Channel Client Channel Tools Channel Red Hat 9 el9-pool-x86_64 - el9-manager-tools-pool-x86_64, el9-manager-tools-updates-x86_64 Red Hat 8 rhel8-pool-x86_64 - res8-manager-tools-pool-x86_64 Red Hat 7 rhel-x86_64-server-7 - res7-suse-manager-tools-x86_64 过程：在命令提示符下添加软件通道 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符下，以 root 身份使用 spacewalk-common-channels 命令添加相应的通道： spacewalk-common-channels \\ \\ \\ \\ ... 如果 自动同步 处于关闭状态，请同步通道： spacewalk-repo-sync -p 确保同步已完成，然后再继续操作。 spacewalk-common-channels 提供的客户端工具通道来自 Uyuni 而非 SUSE。 AppStream 软件源会提供模块化软件包。这会导致 Uyuni Web UI 中显示不正确的软件包信息。您无法使用 Web UI 或 API 直接从模块化软件源执行安装或升级等软件包操作。 或者，您可以使用 Salt 状态管理 Salt 客户端上的模块化软件包，或在客户端上使用 dnf 命令。有关 CLM 的详细信息，请参见 内容生命周期管理。 要使用 RHUI，需要将所需的 HTTP 标头手动添加到配置文件。没有这些标头，将无法成功执行客户端同步。 过程：将 HTTP 标头添加到配置文件 从您的 RHUI 实例中找到 X-RHUI-ID 和 X-RHUI-SIGNATURE HTTP 标头。 您可以在 Red Hat 客户端上使用以下命令从 169.254.169.254 处的云实例元数据 API 中获得值： echo \"X-RHUI-ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document|base64|tr -d '\\n')\" echo \"X-RHUI-SIGNATURE=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature|base64|tr -d '\\n')\" 打开 /etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf 配置文件，使用正确信息添加或编辑下面几行： [] X-RHUI-ID= X-RHUI-SIGNATURE= [] X-RHUI-ID= X-RHUI-SIGNATURE= Replace above with the names of the custom channels you are planning to create (see next section): [rhel8-baseos-repo] X-RHUI-ID=... X-RHUI-SIGNATURE=... Red Hat Enterprise Linux may renew these headers at any point in time. In such a case, repeat the procedure to get the new HTTP headers in place. 要从 RHUI 镜像软件，您需要在 Uyuni 中创建自定义通道和软件源，它们都将通过 URL 链接到 RHUI。您必须在 Red Hat 门户中拥有这些产品的权利，此功能才能正常工作。可以使用 yum 实用程序获得要镜像的软件源的 URL： yum repolist -v | grep baseurl 可以使用这些软件源 URL 来创建自定义软件源。这样您便可只镜像管理客户端所需的内容。 如果您在 Red Hat 门户中拥有正确的权利，就可以只创建 Red Hat 软件源的自定义版本。 此过程所需的细节包括： Table 2. Red Hat 自定义软件源设置 选项 设置 软件源 URL RHUI 提供的内容 URL 包含已签名的元数据？ 取消选中所有 Red Hat Enterprise 软件源 SSL CA 证书 redhat-cert SSL 客户端证书 Entitlement-Cert-Date SSL 客户端密钥 Entitlement-Key-Date 过程：创建自定义软件源 在 Uyuni 服务器 Web UI 上，导航到软件 管理 软件源。 单击 创建软件源，然后为软件源设置适当的参数。 单击 创建软件源。 对需要创建的所有软件源重复以上步骤。 此过程所需的通道包括： Table 3. Red Hat 自定义通道 Red Hat 9 RHEL el9-pool-x86_64 Red Hat 8 RHEL or CentOS 8 Base rhel8-pool-x86_64 Red Hat 7 RHEL7 Base x86_64 rhel7-pool-x86_64 过程：创建自定义通道 在 Uyuni 服务器 Web UI 上，导航到软件 管理 通道。 单击 创建通道，然后为通道设置相应的参数。 在父通道字段中，选择相应的基础通道。 单击 创建通道。 对需要创建的所有通道重复以上步骤。每个自定义软件源都应该有一个自定义通道。 您可以导航到软件 通道列表 所有，以检查是否已创建所有相应的通道和软件源。 对于 Red Hat 8 客户端，请添加基础通道和 AppStream 通道。您需要来自这两个通道的软件包。如果未添加这两个通道，将会因缺少软件包而无法创建引导软件源。 创建所有通道之后，可以将其与您创建的软件源关联： 过程：将通道与软件源关联 在 Uyuni 服务器 Web UI 上，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击要关联的通道。 导航到软件源选项卡，然后选中要与此通道关联的软件源。 单击 更新软件源 以将通道与软件源相关联。 对需要关联的所有通道和软件源重复以上步骤。 可选：导航到同步选项卡，为此软件源设置定期同步日程安排。 单击 立即同步 以立即开始同步。 过程：在 Web UI 中检查同步进度 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与软件源关联的通道。 导航到软件源选项卡，然后单击同步并选中同步状态。 过程：在命令提示符处检查同步进度 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，以 root 身份使用 tail 命令检查同步日志文件： tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/.log 每个子通道在同步过程中都会生成自己的日志。 您需要检查所有基础通道和子通道日志文件，以确保同步已完成。 Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels can be very large. Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. 安装软件包之前，客户端会使用 GPG 密钥检查这些软件包的真实性。只有可信软件才能安装在客户端上。 Trusting a GPG key is important for security on clients. It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. 有关 GPG 密钥的详细信息，请参见 GPG 密钥。 To register your Red Hat clients, you need a bootstrap repository.

To speed up SLE Micro registration, manually reboot the client after the registration script finishes. To register your SLE Micro clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。","title":"注册 SLE Micro 客户端","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-slemicro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-slemicro.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":1},{"text":"2. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":2},{"text":"3. 注册客户端","hash":"_注册客户端","id":3}]},"85":{"id":85,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 添加软件通道 本节包含有关注册运行 SUSE Liberty Linux 操作系统的传统客户端和 Salt 客户端的信息。SUSE Liberty Linux 客户端基于 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 或 CentOS。 SUSE Liberty Linux 客户端有时也称为 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Expanded Support (SLESES)、Liberty、RES 或 Red Hat Expanded Support。 SUSE 提供的 SUSE Liberty Linux 软件通道只提供软件包更新，不提供软件包本身。要注册 SUSE Liberty Linux 客户端，您需要注册（下面列出的）SUSE Liberty Linux 产品以创建必需的基础通道，然后导入任何所需的 Red Hat 或 CentOS 软件包作为自定义子通道。您必须直接从 Red Hat 或 CentOS 获取初始软件包，然后才能应用 SUSE Liberty Linux 软件通道提供的更新。 您需负责安排对 Red Hat 或 CentOS 基础媒体软件源和安装媒体的访问权限。 对于 Uyuni 上的 SUSE Liberty Linux 系统，SUSE 不提供支持。 传统客户端不适用于 SUSE Liberty Linux 8 或 9。仅当 SUSE Liberty Linux 8 和 9 客户端为 Salt 客户端时才受支持。 对于 SUSE Liberty Linux 客户端，所需的一些软件包包含在 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 或 CentOS 安装媒体中。您必须安装这些软件包才能注册 SUSE Liberty Linux 客户端。 SUSE Liberty Linux 产品由 SUSE Customer Center 提供。其中还包含客户端工具软件包。 将 SUSE Liberty Linux 客户端注册到您的 Uyuni 服务器之前，您需要添加所需的软件通道，并同步这些通道。 您需要选择两组不同的通道，一组通道用于提供 SUSE Liberty Linux，另一组通道用于提供客户端工具。 您需要与适当 SUSE Liberty Linux 通道关联的激活密钥。有关激活密钥的详细信息，请参见 激活密钥。 此过程所需的通道包括：","title":"注册 SUSE Liberty Linux 客户端","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-sleses","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-sleses.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":1}]},"86":{"id":86,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 添加软件通道 2. 检查同步状态 3. 管理 GPG 密钥 4.

SELinux 上下文以启用所需的文件属性（例如用户、角色和文件类型）。 如果配置文件包含宏，请输入标记宏开始位置和结束位置的符号。 在文件内容文本框中，使用脚本下拉框选择相应的脚本语言输入配置文件内容。 单击 创建配置文件。 您可以为单个客户端订阅配置通道，方法是导航到系统 系统列表，选择要使用的客户端，然后导航到配置选项卡。要为多个客户端订阅配置通道，可以使用系统集管理器 (SSM)。 过程：为多个客户端订阅配置通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，然后选择要使用的客户端。 导航到系统 系统集管理器，然后转到配置 订阅通道子选项卡，以查看可用配置通道的列表。 可选：单击目前订阅的系统列中的数字以查看目前订阅了配置通道的客户端。 选中要订阅的配置通道，然后单击 继续。 使用向上和向下箭头对配置通道排名。 两个配置通道之间的设置发生冲突时，系统会优先使用更靠近列表顶部的通道。 确定通道应用到所选客户端的方式。 单击 订阅为最低优先级 可将新通道添加为比目前订阅的通道都低的优先级。单击 订阅为最高优先级 可将新通道添加为比目前订阅的通道都高的优先级。单击 替换现有订阅 可去除现有通道并将其替换为新通道。 单击 应用订阅。 如果新配置通道优先级与现有通道冲突，系统会去除重复的通道并根据新优先级进行替换。如果某个操作要对客户端的配置优先级重新排序，Web UI 会要求您在继续之前先确认更改。 您也可以使用系统集管理器 (SSM) 将客户端上部署的配置文件与储存在 Uyuni 服务器上的配置文件进行比较。 过程：比较配置文件 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表，然后选择订阅了要比较的配置文件的客户端。 导航到系统 系统集管理器，然后转到配置 比较文件子选项卡，以查看可用配置文件的列表。 可选：单击系统列中的数字以查看目前订阅了配置文件的客户端。 选中要比较的配置文件，然后单击 安排文件比较。 能够储存一个文件并共用相同的配置非常有用，但有些情况下，您可能需要同一配置文件的许多变体，或者需要只有系统特定细节（例如主机名和 MAC 地址）不同的多个配置文件。在此情况下，您可以在配置文件中使用宏或变量。这样您便可上载和分发包含数百甚至数千变体的单个文件。除了用于提供自定义系统信息的变量外，我们还支持以下标准宏： rhn.system.sid rhn.system.profile_name rhn.system.description rhn.system.hostname rhn.system.ip_address rhn.system.custom_info(key_name) rhn.system.net_interface.ip_address(eth_device) rhn.system.net_interface.netmask(eth_device) rhn.system.net_interface.broadcast(eth_device) rhn.system.net_interface.hardware_address(eth_device) rhn.system.net_interface.driver_module(eth_device) 要使用此功能，请通过配置通道细节页面上载或创建配置文件。然后打开其配置文件细节页面，并根据需要包含支持的宏。请确保用于偏置变量的分界符与宏起始分界符和宏结束分界符字段中设置的分界符匹配，并且与文件中的其他字符不冲突。我们建议使用长度为两个字符且不含百分号 (%) 的分界符。 例如，您可能有一个适用于所有服务器，但只有 IP 地址和主机名不同的文件。您无需为每台服务器都管理一个单独的配置文件，而是可以创建一个文件（例如 server.conf），在其中包含 IP 地址和主机名宏。 hostname={| rhn.system.hostname |} ip_address={| rhn.system.net_interface.ip_address(eth0) |} 当文件传送到各个系统时（无论是通过 Uyuni Web UI 中安排的操作，还是在命令行中使用 Uyuni 配置客户端 (mgrcfg-client) 传送），变量将被替换为 Uyuni 的系统配置文件中所记录的系统主机名和 IP 地址。在此示例中，部署的版本将如下所示： hostname=test.example.domain.com ip_address=177.18.54.7 要获取自定义系统信息，请在自定义信息宏 (rhn.system.custom_info) 中插入键标签。例如，如果您开发了一个标记为“asset”的键，则可以在配置文件中将其添加到自定义信息宏中，以便在任何包含该键的系统上替换该值。该宏将如下所示： asset={@ rhn.system.custom_info(asset) @} 将文件部署到包含该键值的系统上时，宏将会被转译，生成如下所示的字符串： asset=Example#456 如果要包含默认值（例如，如果需要默认值以防发生错误），您可以将其追加到自定义信息宏中，如下所示： asset={@ rhn.system.custom_info(asset) = 'Asset #' @} 此默认值会被任何包含该值的系统上的值覆盖。 在 Uyuni 客户端计算机上可以使用 Uyuni 配置管理器 (mgrcfg-manager) 来协助进行系统管理。它不会转译或更改文件，因为该工具与系统没有关联。mgrcfg-manager 命令不依赖于系统设置。无法插入二进制文件。","title":"配置管理","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuration-management","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/configuration-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For more information about Salt in general, see Salt Guide Overview. The Salt Contact Method is the best scaling method. All new Uyuni features are supported and it has the widest variety of supported operating systems. All new operating systems are always supported with this contact method. Software updates are generally pushed from the server to the client. Connections are initiated from the client. This means you must open ports on the server, not on clients. The Salt clients are also known as Salt minions. Uyuni Server installs a daemon on every client. If you need to use Salt clients in a disconnected setup you can configure Push via Salt SSH as a contact method. With this contact method, clients can be located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. For more information about Push via Salt SSH, see 通过 Salt SSH 推送. Salt 使用自己的数据库来保存受控端的密钥。此数据库需要与 Uyuni 数据库保持同步。 一旦 Salt 中接受了密钥，Uyuni 中的初始配置过程即会开始。 初始配置过程通过搜索 minion_id 和 machine-id 在 Uyuni 数据库中查找现有系统。 如果没有找到任何系统，将会创建新系统。 如果找到包含 minion_id 或 machine-id 的项，将会迁移该系统以与新系统匹配。 如果找到包含这两项的系统，并且它们不是同一个系统，将会中止初始配置并显示错误。 在这种情况下，管理员需要至少去除一个系统来解决冲突。","title":"Salt 客户端的联系方法","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-salt","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-salt.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 初始配置细节","hash":"onboarding-details","id":1}]},"95":{"id":95,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 什么是 Salt 捆绑包？ 2. 使用 Salt 捆绑包将客户端注册为受控端 2.1. 将 Salt 捆绑包与 Salt 受控端结合使用 2.2. 从 Salt 受控端切换到 Salt 捆绑包 3. 使用 Salt 捆绑包执行 Salt SSH 操作 4. 使用 pip 通过 Python 软件包扩展 Salt 捆绑包 Salt 捆绑包是单个二进制软件包，包含 Salt 受控端、Python 3、必需的 Python 模块以及库。 Salt 捆绑包随附 Python 3 以及运行 Salt 所需满足的所有条件。因此 Salt 捆绑包不会将客户端上安装的 Python 版本用作系统软件。Salt 捆绑包可以安装在不满足指定 Salt 版本的要求的客户端上。 此外，还可以在所运行 Salt 受控端连接到 Uyuni Salt 主控端以外的 Salt 主控端的系统上使用 Salt 捆绑包。 建议的注册方法是使用 Salt 捆绑包进行注册。本节介绍当前实现的优点和局限性。Salt 捆绑包以 venv-salt-minion 的形式提供，其中包含 Salt、Python 3 以及 Salt 依赖的 Python 模块。通过 Web UI 引导时使用的也是 Salt 捆绑包，因此通过 Web UI 引导不依赖 Python 来进行。借助 Salt 捆绑包，客户端不再需要提供任何 Python 解释器或模块。 如果您引导新客户端，默认的注册方法是使用 Salt 捆绑包注册。您可以将现有客户端切换为使用 Salt 捆绑包方法。如果切换，将会安装 salt-minion 软件包及其依赖项。 可以同时使用 Salt 捆绑包与由 Uyuni 服务器以外的 Salt 主控端管理的 Salt 受控端。如果将 Salt 捆绑包安装在客户端上，Uyuni 服务器将会管理 Salt 捆绑包的配置文件，在此情况下，salt-minion 的配置文件将不会受到管理。有关详细信息，请参见 Salt 捆绑包配置。 如果某个客户端的 Salt 受控端由 Uyuni 服务器以外的 Salt 主控端进行管理，要引导该客户端，建议在生成引导脚本时使用 mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle，或在引导脚本中将 FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION 设为 1。 要使用 Web UI 进行引导，可以全局指定 mgr_force_venv_salt_minion 设为 true 的 pillar。有关详细信息，请参见 Salt States and Pillars。 可以使用 Salt 状态 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 从 salt-minion 切换到 venv-salt-minion。建议分两步来切换到 venv-salt-minion，以免在切换过程中出现任何问题： 过程：使用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 状态切换到 venv-salt-minion 首先，在不指定任何 pillar 的情况下应用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion。这样会通过复制配置文件等数据切换到 venv-salt-minion。此过程不会清理原始的 salt-minion 配置及其软件包。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 在 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt 设为 True（用于去除 salt-minion）以及 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files 设为 True（用于去除与 salt-minion 相关的所有文件）的情况下应用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion。此第二步用于确保第一步已经处理，然后去除旧配置文件以及现已过时的 salt-minion 软件包。 salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' 如果切换过程中跳过第一步来运行第二步，状态应用过程可能会失败，因为此过程需要停止用于在客户端执行命令的 salt-minion。 反过来，您也可以不安装 Salt 捆绑包，而是继续使用 salt-minion。在此情况下，请指定以下其中一个选项： 指定 --no-bundle 选项来执行 mgr-bootstrap。 在生成的引导脚本中，将 AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION 设为 1。 对于引导状态，将 mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillar 设为 True。 在对客户端执行 Salt SSH 操作时，也可使用 Salt 捆绑包。 在执行任何 Salt 命令前，外壳脚本会将 Salt 捆绑包部署到目标系统上，而不会安装 venv-salt-minion。由于 Salt 捆绑包包含整个 Salt 代码库，因此不会部署 salt-thin。Salt SSH（包括使用 Web UI 进行引导）使用捆绑包中的 Python 3 解释器。目标系统上不需要安装任何其他 Python 解释器。 随该捆绑包部署的 Python 3 用于处理客户端上的 Salt SSH 会话，因此 Salt SSH（包括使用 Web UI 进行引导）不依赖于在系统上安装 Python。 可以将 salt-thin 作为一种后备方法，但这种方法需要在客户端上安装 Python 3。不建议也不支持使用此方法，此方法仅用于开发目的。请在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 配置文件中将 web.ssh_use_salt_thin 设为 true。 The bootstrap repository must be created before bootstrapping the client with Web UI. Salt SSH is using the Salt Bundle taken from the bootstrap repository based on the detected target operating system. For more information, see client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository. Salt SSH 使用 /var/tmp 在安装了绑定 Python 的客户端上部署 Salt 捆绑包和执行 Salt 命令。因此，切勿使用 noexec 选项挂载 /var/tmp。无法通过 Web UI 引导使用 noexec 选项挂载 /var/tmp 的客户端，因为引导过程是使用 Salt SSH 来访问客户端的。 Salt 捆绑包提供了 pip，使用该命令可以通过额外的 Python 软件包扩展绑定 Salt 受控端的功能。 默认情况下，salt pip.install 会将 指定的 Python 软件包安装到 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local 中。 如果需要，可以通过为 venv-salt-minion.service 设置 VENV_PIP_TARGET 环境变量来覆盖路径 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local。建议为该服务使用 systemd 普适性配置文件。可以使用配置文件 /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf 来实现该目的： [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip 更新 Salt 捆绑包时，通过 pip 安装的 Python 软件包不会发生变化。为了确保更新后这些软件包可用且可正常运行，建议在 Salt 捆绑包更新后在应用了 Salt 状态的情况下安装这些软件包。","title":"Salt 捆绑包","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 什么是 Salt 捆绑包？","hash":"_什么是_salt_捆绑包","id":1},{"text":"2. 使用 Salt 捆绑包将客户端注册为受控端","hash":"_使用_salt_捆绑包将客户端注册为受控端","id":2},{"text":"2.1. 将 Salt 捆绑包与 Salt 受控端结合使用","hash":"_将_salt_捆绑包与_salt_受控端结合使用","id":3},{"text":"2.2. 从 Salt 受控端切换到 Salt 捆绑包","hash":"_从_salt_受控端切换到_salt_捆绑包","id":4},{"text":"3. 使用 Salt 捆绑包执行 Salt SSH 操作","hash":"_使用_salt_捆绑包执行_salt_ssh_操作","id":5},{"text":"4. 使用 pip 通过 Python 软件包扩展 Salt 捆绑包","hash":"_使用_pip_通过_python_软件包扩展_salt_捆绑包","id":6}]},"96":{"id":96,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 可用参数 2. 操作的执行 3. 未来的功能 Push via Salt SSH is used in environments where Salt clients cannot reach the Uyuni Server directly. In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network where the Uyuni Server is located. Push via Salt SSH is also to use if installing a daemon agent on clients is not possible. The Push via Salt SSH method has serious limitations. It does not scale well, and consumes more Server resources and network bandwidth than the plain Salt method. The Push via Salt SSH method is not at all supported with large setups (1000 clients and more). The Push via Salt SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the Uyuni Server on the internal network to the clients located in the DMZ. After all actions such as updates and events are pushed and executed, the tunnel is closed. The server uses the Salt SSH to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. 下图说明了通过 Salt SSH 推送的进程路径。Taskomatic 块左侧的各项表示在 Uyuni 客户端上运行的进程。 To use Push via Salt SSH, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the salt-api daemon running on the Uyuni Server.

When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted as soon as the channel is refreshed or the first package gets installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. 由于基于 Debian 的系统仅会对元数据签名，因此不需要为各个通道指定确切的密钥。如果用户按 为软件源元数据签名 中的“使用自己的 GPG 密钥”所述配置了自己的 GPG 密钥来对元数据签名，系统会自动部署并信任该密钥。 用户可以自行定义要部署到客户端的 GPG 密钥。 通过提供某些 pillar 数据并在 Salt 文件系统中提供 GPG 密钥文件，系统会自动将它们部署到客户端。 这些密钥会分别部署到 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/（在基于 RPM 的操作系统上）和 /usr/share/keyrings/（在 Debian 系统上）中： 为您要将密钥部署到的客户端定义 pillar 键 custom_gpgkeys 并列出密钥文件名。 cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg 此外，在 Salt 文件系统中创建名为 gpg 的目录，并将 custom_gpgkeys pillar 数据中所指定的 GPG 密钥文件储存在该目录下。 ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 密钥现在会部署到客户端的 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 和 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 中。 最后一步是将 URL 添加到软件通道的“GPG 密钥 URL”字段中。请导航到软件 管理 通道，然后选择要修改的通道。将值 file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 添加到 GPG 密钥 URL中。 过程：在客户端上使用引导脚本信任 GPG 密钥 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，检查 /srv/www/htdocs/pub/

This workflow shows you how to use the Uyuni Web UI to create a centrally managed configuration file, assign it to a Salt client, and apply the configuration. If you are managing a lot of clients, you probably do not want to manually apply configuration settings to each of them in turn. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a configuration channel containing a configuration file, have assigned clients to the channel, and applied the configuration successfully. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. At least one Salt client registered to your server. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a centrally managed configuration file and a Salt state. You can also use locally managed configuration files, traditional clients, and different methods, to get more flexibility in how you manage configuration in your environment.

Related topics If you are managing a lot of clients and you need to apply customized packages to them, you can use content lifecycle management (CLM) to manage your packages. CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, which you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. Procedure: Create a new CLM project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. Leave the Filters section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example. You can add filters later on if you need to. In the Environment Lifecycle section, create three environments: production, testing, and development. Click Add Environment and complete the name and label for each. For the production environment, leave the Insert before field blank. For the testing environment, in the Insert before field, select production. For the development environment, in the Insert before field, select testing``. Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel -production-. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel -testing-. Click Next to assign the client. Procedure: Promote Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section.

Migration of Traditional clients This workflow shows how to automatically complete the task of in-place SUSE Linux Enterprise Server instances upgrade with Uyuni Server. The workflow is applicable for both Salt and Traditional clients. In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/Autoyast file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade true #if $channel_prefix != \"\" https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #else https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #end if $channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool sle-manager-tools Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration depending on the type of your client. For Salt clients, go to Migration of Salt clients. For Traditional clients, go to Migration of Traditional clients. Procedure: Migrating Salt clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. + image::wf-inplaceMigration-06.png[scaledwidth=80%] + image::wf-inplaceMigration-07.png[scaledwidth=80%] Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time for Salt clients. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console. If your profile is clean, it should complete an in-place migration in about 30 minutes - depending on the speed of your network, client, and the number of required packages in the migration. Procedure: Migrating Traditional clients Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. If your system is able to use PXE, it can be completely automated from here. If your system is not able to use PXE, you can create an ISO to install with cobbler commands using the SUSE Manager server CLI. Copy the ISO file output to the machine you wish to migrate and boot from it. View all the profiles with this: cobbler profile list Output will look something like: 15sp1-demo-test:1:Demosite Then build the ISO file with this command: cobbler buildiso --iso=/tmp/15sp1-demo-test.iso --profiles=15sp1-demo-test:1:Demosite The --iso= section is the output of the buildiso command, and needs full path. Copy this ISO to the virtualization environment where your system can use it as boot media.","title":"In-place upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Step-by-step workflow instructions 5. Related topics Uyuni is all about managing client systems. So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients. This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see 支持的客户端系统. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see 客户端注册方法. Procedure: Configure a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on your client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.suma.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.suma.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare software channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an activation key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Image copying from SUSE registry to internal registry 2. Air-gapped solution for Podman It is possible to deploy containerized images in an environment without an internet connection. In such case, the images can be copied from SUSE registry to an internal registry, or saved to a tar file. This example illustrates deployment of Salt proxies only. Machines must have access to registry.suse.com. Procedure: Deploying Salt Proxy from an internal image registry On a machine with access to registry.suse.com install skopeo: zypper in skopeo This can be Uyuni Server.

Red Hat 或其他产品需增加 1 GB。 如果服务器是 ISS 主服务器，则空间需要增加一倍。 交换空间 3 GB Uyuni 性能取决于硬件资源、网络带宽、客户端与服务器之间的延迟，等等。 根据所用体验和部署方式的不同，Uyuni 服务器与足够数量的代理配套使用时，建议每个服务器处理的客户端不要超过 10,000 个，以便获得最佳性能。当客户端数量超过 10,000 个时，强烈建议改为使用集线器设置并咨询相关专业人员。即使优化了设置并配备了充足的代理，数量如此庞大的客户端也可能导致发生性能问题。 有关如何管理大量客户端的详细信息，请参见 Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deployments。 Table 2. 代理硬件要求 硬件 细节 建议 CPU 最少 2 个专用的 64 位 CPU 核心 RAM

/var/cache/ 目录越大，代理与 Uyuni 服务器之间的流量就越少。 使代理上的 /var/cache/ 目录与 Uyuni 服务器上的 /var/spacewalk/ 保持相同的大小，可以避免在首次同步后出现大量的流量。 Uyuni 服务器上的 /var/cache/ 目录相比代理上的目录可能较小。 有关大小估算的指导，请参见 服务器硬件要求 一节。 我们建议将 Uyuni 的软件源和数据库储存在单独的储存设备上。这有助于避免数据丢失。必须在运行 YaST Uyuni 安装过程之前设置储存设备。 Uyuni 需要三个不同的卷： 数据库卷：/var/lib/pgsql 通道卷：/var/spacewalk 缓存：/var/cache 我们建议使用 XFS 作为所有卷的文件系统类型。此外，对于本地安装，请考虑使用逻辑卷管理 (LVM) 来管理磁盘。用于储存软件源的磁盘大小取决于您要使用 Uyuni 管理的发行套件和通道数目。请参见本节中的表格来估算所需大小。 在 Uyuni 服务器上，使用以下命令找到所有可用的储存设备： hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" 使用 lsblk 命令查看每个设备的名称和大小。 结合设备名使用 suma-storage 命令将外部磁盘设置为数据库和软件源的位置： suma-storage [] 外部储存卷将设置为挂载到 /manager_storage 和 /pgsql_storage 的 XFS 分区。 可对通道数据和数据库使用同一个储存设备。但不建议这样做，因为不断增长的通道软件源可能会填满储存，从而给数据库完整性带来风险。使用独立的储存设备还可以提高性能。如果您想要使用单个储存设备，请结合单个设备名参数运行 suma-storage。 如果您正在安装代理，suma-storage 命令只采用单个设备名参数，并将外部储存位置设置为 Squid 缓存。 为 Uyuni 服务器和代理创建磁盘分区时，请确保正确设置权限。 对于 /var/lib/pgsql： 拥有者：读取、写入、执行 组：读取、执行 用户：无 对于 /var/spacewalk： 拥有者：读取、写入、执行 组：读取、写入、执行

为使安全链保持不变，Uyuni Proxy 功能要求为 SSL 证书签名的 CA 与为 Uyuni Server 证书签名的 CA 相同。不支持对代理和服务器使用由不同 CA 签名的证书。 configure-proxy.sh 脚本将完成 Uyuni Proxy 的设置。 执行交互式 configure-proxy.sh 脚本。如果在不提供其他输入的情况下按 Enter，脚本将使用方括号 [] 中提供的默认值。下面是有关所请求设置的一些信息： Uyuni 父项：Uyuni 父项可以是另一个代理或 Uyuni 服务器。 HTTP 代理 Uyuni Proxy 可以通过 HTTP 代理访问 Web。如果防火墙禁止直接访问 Web，则需要使用 HTTP 代理。 回溯电子邮件 要将问题报告到的电子邮件地址。 使用 SSL 出于安全原因，请按 Y。 您要导入现有证书吗？ 请按 N。这可以确保使用前面从 Uyuni 服务器复制的新证书。 组织 下一组问题与代理 SSL 证书的用法特征有关。组织可能是服务器上使用的同一组织，当然，如果您的代理不在主服务器所在的同一组织中，则两个组织是不同的。 组织单位 此处的默认值是代理的主机名。 城市 附加到代理证书的其他信息。 州/省 附加到代理证书的其他信息。 国家/地区代码 在国家/地区代码字段中，输入安装 Uyuni 期间设置的国家/地区代码。例如，如果您的代理位于美国，而 Uyuni 位于德国，请为代理输入 DE。 国家/地区代码必须是两个大写字母。有关国家/地区代码的完整列表，请参见 https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search。 CNAME 别名（空格分隔） 如果可以通过不同的 DNS CNAME 别名访问您的代理，请使用此字段。否则可将其留空。 CA 口令 输入 Uyuni 服务器的证书使用的口令。 您要使用现有的 SSH 密钥来代理 SSH-Push Salt 受控端吗？ 如果您要重复使用对服务器上的 SSH-Push Salt 客户端所用的 SSH 密钥，请使用此选项。 要创建并填充配置通道 rhn_proxy_config_1000010001 吗？ 接受默认值 Y。 SUSE Manager 用户名 使用 Uyuni 服务器上的相同用户名和口令。 如果缺少某些部分（例如 CA 密钥和公共证书），脚本将列显必须执行的以集成所需文件的命令。复制必需的文件后，请再次运行 configure-proxy.sh。如果在执行脚本期间收到 HTTP 错误，请再次运行脚本。 configure-proxy.sh 激活 Uyuni Proxy 所需的服务，例如 squid、apache2、salt-broker 和 jabberd。 要检查代理系统及其客户端的状态，请在 Web UI 中单击代理系统的细节页（单击系统 代理，然后单击系统名称）。连接和代理子选项卡会显示各种状态信息。 要通过代理启用 PXE 引导，必须在 Uyuni 代理和 Uyuni 服务器上安装并配置额外的软件。 在 Uyuni Proxy 上安装 susemanager-tftpsync-recv 软件包： zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv 在 Uyuni Proxy 上，运行 configure-tftpsync.sh 设置脚本并输入请求的信息： configure-tftpsync.sh 需要提供 Uyuni 服务器和代理的主机名与 IP 地址。此外，需要输入代理上 tftpboot 目录的路径。 在 Uyuni 服务器上安装 susemanager-tftpsync： zypper in susemanager-tftpsync 在 Uyuni 服务器上运行 configure-tftpsync.sh。 这会创建配置并将其上载到 Uyuni Proxy： configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy 在 Uyuni 服务器上启动初始同步： cobbler sync 也可以在 Cobbler 中发生了需要立即同步的更改后执行此操作。如果不执行此操作，Cobbler 同步将在需要时自动运行。有关 Cobbler 所支持的自动安装的详细信息，请参见 操作系统安装。 Uyuni 使用 Cobbler 进行客户端置备。PXE (tftp) 默认已安装并已激活。客户端必须能够使用 DHCP 在 Uyuni Proxy 上找到 PXE 引导。对于包含要置备的客户端的区域，请使用以下 DHCP 配置： next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" 代理不会储存有关与它连接的客户端的任何信息，因此您随时可更换代理。此过程通过重新激活密钥处理，这样可防止您丢失代理的历史记录。如果不使用重新激活密钥，更换代理将会变成新代理，但会使用新的 ID。更换代理必须使用与其前任代理相同的名称和 IP 地址。 要将传统代理转变为 Salt 代理，您可以重新安装代理。 在安装代理期间，客户端将无法访问 Uyuni 服务器。删除某个代理后，系统列表可能暂时不正确。以前已连接到该代理的所有客户端将显示为直接连接到服务器。在客户端上成功完成第一个操作（例如执行远程命令，或者安装软件包或补丁）后，此信息将自动更正。这种更正可能发生在几小时之后。 准备替换时，请关闭旧代理并使其保持已安装状态。为此系统创建重新激活密钥，然后使用重新激活密钥注册新代理。如果您不使用重新激活密钥，则需要针对新代理重新注册所有客户端。 过程：替换传统代理并保持客户端的已注册状态 开始迁移前，请根据需要保存旧代理的数据。请考虑将重要数据或自定义数据复制到新代理也可访问的中心位置。 关闭旧代理。 安装新的 Uyuni 代理。有关安装说明，请参见 代理安装。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，选择新安装的 Uyuni 代理并将其从系统列表中删除。 在 Web UI 中，为旧代理系统创建重新激活密钥。在旧代理的系统细节选项卡上单击重新激活。单击生成新密钥并记下新密钥。 按 SUSE Manager Proxy 注册 中所述使用引导脚本注册新代理。在引导脚本中，使用 REACTIVATION_KEY 参数设置重新激活密钥。 基于您之前创建的备份恢复代理数据。请参见此过程的第 1 步。 对于 Salt 代理，您需要在引导新代理之前执行一些额外的步骤。 过程：替换 Salt 代理并保持客户端的已注册状态 开始迁移前，请根据需要保存旧代理的数据。请考虑将重要数据或自定义数据复制到新代理也可访问的中心位置。 关闭旧代理。 在 Web UI 中，为旧代理系统创建重新激活密钥。在旧代理的系统细节选项卡上单击重新激活。单击生成新密钥并记下新密钥。 在 Web UI 中，导航到 Salt 密钥，找到与旧代理关联的 Salt 密钥，然后单击 删除。 安装新的 Uyuni 代理。有关安装说明，请参见 代理安装。 按 SUSE Manager Proxy 注册 中所述使用引导脚本注册新代理。在引导脚本中，使用 REACTIVATION_KEY

上对这些指令进行过测试，不过它们进行一定修改后在其他提供商的云服务上也应能正常工作。 在开始之前，请注意以下一些事项： Uyuni 设置过程执行正向确认的反向 DNS 查找。此操作必须成功，设置过程才能完成，并且 Uyuni 才能按预期方式运行。请务必在设置 Uyuni 之前执行主机名和 IP 配置。 Uyuni Server 和 Proxy 实例需在适当的网络配置中运行，该网络配置可让您控制 DNS 项，但无法通过因特网自由访问。 在此网络配置中必须提供 DNS 解析：hostname -f 必须返回完全限定的域名 (FQDN)。 DNS 解析对于连接客户端也很重要。 DNS 取决于所选的云框架。有关详细说明，请参见云提供商文档。 我们建议将软件软件源、服务器数据库和代理 squid 缓存储存在外部虚拟磁盘上。这可以防止在实例意外终止时丢失数据。本节包含有关设置外部虚拟磁盘的说明。 如果您正在尝试引导传统客户端，请在已登录到客户端的情况下检查是否可以解析服务器的主机名。可能需要将服务器的 FQDN 添加到客户端上的 /etc/hosts 本地解析文件。请结合服务器的本地 IP 地址使用 hostname -f 命令进行检查。 在公有云上使用 Uyuni 时，必须使用受限制的网络。我们建议使用带有适当防火墙设置的 VPN 专用子网。只能允许指定 IP 范围内的计算机访问该实例。 在公有云上运行 Uyuni 时，必须应用安全措施来限制对该实例的访问。全球可访问的 Uyuni 实例违反了 Uyuni EULA 的条款，且不受 SUSE 的支持。 要访问 Uyuni Web UI，请在配置网络访问控制时允许 HTTPS。这将允许您访问 Uyuni Web UI。 在 EC2 和 Azure 中，创建一个新安全组，并添加 HTTPS 入站和出站规则。在 GCE 中，选中防火墙部分下的允许 HTTPS 流量复选框。 我们建议将 Uyuni 的软件源和数据库储存在不同于根卷的储存设备上。这有助于避免数据丢失。不要使用逻辑卷管理 (LVM) 进行公有云安装。 必须在运行 YaST Uyuni 设置过程之前设置储存设备。 用于储存软件源的磁盘大小取决于您要使用 Uyuni 管理的发行套件和通道数目。挂接虚拟磁盘时，它们将作为 Unix 设备节点显示在实例中。设备节点的名称因提供商及所选实例类型而异。 确保 Uyuni 服务器的根卷大小不少于 100 GB。如果可能，请另外添加一个 500 GB 或以上大小的储存磁盘，并选择 SSD 储存类型。当您的实例启动时，Uyuni 服务器的云映像会使用脚本来指派这个单独的卷。 启动实例后，您便可登录 Uyuni 服务器，并使用以下命令查找所有可用的储存设备： hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" 如果您不确定应选择哪个设备，可使用 lsblk 命令查看每个设备的名称和大小。请选择与要寻找的虚拟磁盘大小匹配的名称。 您可以使用 suma-storage 命令设置外部磁盘。这会创建一个挂载到 /manager_storage 的 XFS 分区，并使用它作为储存数据库和软件源的位置：

Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_4 \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see 注册 openSUSE Leap 客户端. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[]. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see 使用引导脚本注册客户端. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL 证书. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see 通过网络安装（PXE 引导）. Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Manager Proxy 设置. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_4 \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see 注册 openSUSE Leap 客户端. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[]. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see 使用引导脚本注册客户端. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL 证书. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see 通过网络安装（PXE 引导）. Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Manager Proxy 设置. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

Configure a resolvable fully qualified domain name on the server before you begin, to ensure that the server is accessible across the network. The Uyuni Server software is available from download.opensuse.org, and you can use zypper to retrieve the software and install it. Procedure: Installing openSUSE Leap with Uyuni Install openSUSE Leap as the base system, and ensure all available service packs and package updates have been applied. Configure a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. At the command prompt, as root, add the repository for installing the Uyuni Server software: repo=repositories/systemsmanagement:/ repo=${repo}Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-x86_64-Media1/ zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/$repo uyuni-server-stable Refresh metadata from the repositories: zypper ref Install the pattern for the Uyuni Server: zypper in patterns-uyuni_server Reboot the server. When the installation is complete, you can continue with Uyuni setup. For more information, see Uyuni Server 设置. The initial setup procedure is handled by YaST. Procedure: Uyuni Setup Log in to the Uyuni Server and start YaST. In YaST, navigate to Network Services Uyuni Setup to begin the setup. From the introduction screen select Uyuni Setup Set up Uyuni from scratch and click Next to continue. Enter an email address to receive status notifications and click Next to continue. Uyuni can sometimes send a large volume of notification emails. You can disable email notifications in the Web UI after setup, if you need to. Enter your certificate information and a password. Passwords must be at at least seven characters in length, and must not contain spaces, single or double quotation marks (' or \"), exclamation marks (!), or dollar signs ($). Always store your passwords in a secure location. If you need to also set up a Uyuni Proxy Server, ensure you have taken a note of the certificate password. Click Next to continue. From the Uyuni Setup Database Settings screen, enter a database user and password and click Next to continue. Passwords must be at at least seven characters in length, and must not contain spaces, single or double quotation marks (' or \"), exclamation marks (!), or dollar signs ($). Always store your passwords in a secure location. Click Next to continue. Click Yes to run setup when prompted. When setup is complete, click Next to continue. You will see the address of the Uyuni Web UI. Click Finish to complete Uyuni setup. Before you can log in to the server to manage your clients, you need to have created an administration account. The main administration account has the highest authority within Uyuni. Ensure you keep access information for this account secure. We recommend that you create lower level administration accounts for organizations and groups. Do not share the main administration access details. Procedure: Setting Up the Main Administration Account In your web browser, enter the address for the Uyuni Web UI. This address was provided after you completed setup. Sign in to the Web UI, navigate to the Create Organization Organization Name field, and enter your organization name. In the Create Organization Desired Login and Create Organization Desired Password fields, enter your username and password. Fill in the account information fields, including an email for system notifications. Click Create Organization to finish creating your administration account. When you have completed the Uyuni Web UI setup, you are taken to the Home Overview page. SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This table lists architecture, channels, and status information. If your SUSE Linux Enterprise client is based on x86_64 architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products to start product synchronization. When a channel is added, Uyuni will schedule the channel for synchronization. Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time. You can monitor synchronization progress in the Web UI. For more information about using the setup wizard, see Wizard. When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients. For more instructions, see 客户端注册.","title":"Install Uyuni Server with openSUSE Leap","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"quickstart-install-uyuni-server","url":"/uyuni/quickstart/quickstart-install-uyuni-server.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

To get started, install the mgr-actions-control tool on the Uyuni Server, and use it to enable configuration management for your organization. Use the mgr-actions-control tool to enable and disable configuration management on a client. Actions that can be performed with mgr-actions-control include: Deploy a configuration file on a client Upload a file from the client Compare the configuration tools available on a client, with what is being used Run remote commands You must be logged in to Uyuni with an administrator account to use mgr-actions-control. This tool works by adding or removing files and directories on the client in the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/ directory. By default, this directory requires root permissions. The available options for mgr-actions-control are listed in this table. Use this syntax for mgr-actions-control commands: mgr-actions-control [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option] Table 2. Action Control Options Option Abbreviated Option Description enable-all Enable all options disable-all Disable all options. enable-deploy Allow mgrcfg-client to deploy files. enable-diff Allow mgrcfg-client to diff files. enable-upload Allow mgrcfg-client to upload files. enable-mtime-upload Allow mgrcfg-client to upload file modification time. enable-run Enable running scripts. disable-deploy Disable deployment. disable-diff Disable diff use. disable-upload Disable file uploads. disable-mtime-upload Disable modification time upload. disable-run Disable running scripts. report Report whether modes are enabled or disabled. force f Force the operation without asking first. help h Show help message and exit. For more information about the available options for the mgr-actions-control tool, see the man page: man mgr-actions-control Use the mgrcfg-client tool to manage configuration on a client. The mgrcfg-client has these primary modes: list get channels diff verify The available commands and arguments for mgrcfg-client are listed in this section. Use this syntax for mgrcfg-client commands: mgrcfg-client [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option] [mode] The list mode lists the configuration files for the client, including the labels of the configuration channels containing them. To see a complete list of all the configuration files that are currently applied to the client, use this command: mgrcfg-client list The output looks like this: DoFoS Config Channel File F config-channel-17 /etc/config-file F config-channel-17 /var/spool/aalib.rpm F config-channel-14 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf In this output, DoFoS means Directory, File, or Something else. Each entry in the output will be marked with D, F, or S. These configuration files apply to the client. Get more detail about a channel by specifying the channel name: mgrcfg-client list config-channel-14 The output looks like this: Files in config channel 'config-channel-14' /etc/config-file /etc/rhn/rhn.conf It is possible that there are duplicate configuration files in different channels. In this case, the file listing for the channel shows files that are not present when listing channels applied to the client. This is a result of file ranking, which means that channels can contain files that are not applied to the client, because they are outranked by a different file from a different channel. The get mode displays the contents of the primary configuration file for the client. To see the configuration file with the highest rank within the channel, use this command: mgrcfg-client get To see a specific configuration file, use this command: mgrcfg-client get The available options for mgrcfg-client get are listed in this table.

Comparing containerized and non-containerized workflows 5. Validating saltboot group configuration To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server 4.3 or newer one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized Uyuni for Retail environment does not use Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using Uyuni Server 4.3 or newer. Older images will not work. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configure DHCP for PXE booting. See DHCPd Formula how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server. Without using DHCP formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. See below for example. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Follow guide 系统组 to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. With this, our branch group is converted to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot Groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. See Terminal Names for explanation of possible configurations. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server 4.3 where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is build and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Non-Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with what parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Saltboot Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see 映像构建和管理. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Image Synchronizing to the Branch Server If you have very large images that you need to synchronize to the branch server, you can use delta images to save network bandwidth. A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be - and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar file in /srv/susemanager/pillar_data/images/. Performance tuning is possible with the -B option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once 2. Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains 3. Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot 4. Configure the Server to Auto-Accept You can configure Uyuni to automatically accept the keys of newly deployed terminals. This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once On the branch server, create a configuration file called /etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key At the command prompt, add the new configuration file to the existing initrd: echo ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf | / cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 11/12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 11 and SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the element, add: Save the file and rebuild the image. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot Configure the PXE formula to specify these kernel parameters during booting: SALT_AUTOSIGN_GRAINS=autosign_key: PXE boot the Salt client. The formula creates the ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf configuration file and passes it to initrd. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept On the Uyuni Server, open the master configuration file in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, and add or edit this line: autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot: For multiple keys, put each one on a new line.

Deploy Terminals over a Wireless Network 2.1. Change Wireless Credentials 2.2. Use Multiple Wireless Networks If you are not able to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deploy Terminals. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if= of= When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. Build the image. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Deploy Images to the Terminals 5. Re-Deploy Images to the Terminals 6. Customize the Terminal Image Download Process When you have the Uyuni Server and Branch Server set up, you are ready to deploy point-of-service terminals by following these steps: Create hardware type groups Assign and configure the Saltboot formula for each hardware type group Synchronize images to the branch server Deploy images to the terminals Each procedure is detailed in this section. For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. For Uyuni 4.2 and later, terminals can be either x86-64 or ARM64 architecture. For earlier versions, terminals must be x86 architecture only. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see 映像构建和管理. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync If you have 32-bit machines included in your branch, then you must use a 32-bit boot image as a default boot image. If a 32-bit boot image is not used as a default boot image, 32-bit terminals will be unable to boot and operate properly. Check the available boot images and their architecture from the command line: salt pillar.item boot_images Output: POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0: ---------- arch: x86_64 ... legacy-6.0.0: ---------- arch: i686 In this example, the legacy-6.0.0 boot image is 32-bit. You can set the default boot image in the Image Synchronization formula on the branch server, by adding the chosen boot image name to the Default boot image field. For more information about Image Synchronization formula, see Image Synchronization Formula. When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can instruct terminals to download and deploy images when they are restarted. This is achieved using a Salt state. Procedure: Forcing a Terminal to Re-Deploy Images On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, apply this Salt state: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. If your terminal encounters a problem with the file system or the partition table, you might need to remove the partition table and reformat the terminal. Re-partitioning a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions. Procedure: Forcing a Terminal to Re-partition the Hard Disk On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, apply this Salt state: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_repartition Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. 编辑 /srv/pillar/top.sls 文件： base: '*': - saltboot_proto Edit the /srv/pillar/saltboot_proto.sls file: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. 编辑 /srv/pillar/top.sls 文件： base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Edit the /srv/pillar/$branch_prefix.sls file: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin.","title":"Deploy Terminals","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Partitioning and Image Deployment Formula Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your Uyuni for Retail installation. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to apply common Uyuni formulas. For the most commonly used formulas, see Salt Formulas. All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. If you are unsure of the correct formula configuration details, run the retail_branch_init command before you begin to create the recommended formula configuration. You can then manually edit the formulas as required. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula VSFTP formula, see VsFTPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services. Use the Saltboot formula to specify disk partitioning, and to select which image should be deployed. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula.","title":"Introduction to Retail Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-formulas-intro","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-formulas-intro.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Synchronize Images to the Branch Server To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies, or containerized proxy one or more Uyuni build hosts This section covers how to configure your Uyuni for Retail environment, including: Prepare POS images Prepare system groups Configure services for Saltboot Synchronize POS images to the branch servers The very first time you set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps. You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see 映像构建和管理. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. SLES 11 reached end of life and is no longer supported and can stop working at any moment. POS Terminals based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP 3 can be deployed in much the same way as other terminals, with a few differences. You must use the SLES 11 template SLES 11 images need to be activated with the SLES11 SP3 i586 and SLEPOS 11 SP3 i586 channels Ensure that SLES 11 images are built on the SLES 11 build host. Building on the incorrect build host will cause your build to fail. If you are building images for SLES 11 using profiles from an HTTPS git repository that uses TLS 1.0 or greater, it will fail. SLES 11 does not support later versions of TLS. You will need to clone the repository locally to use it for building. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deploy Terminals. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 有关系统组的详细信息，请参见 系统组。 During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see 使用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 进行监视. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible 集成. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server ; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server ; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deploy Terminals. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly. For more information about Image Synchronization Formula, see Image Synchronization Formula.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Mass Configuration 1.1. Configure Multiple Branch Servers 2. Terminal Mass Configuration 2.1. Configure Multiple Terminals 3. Export Configuration to Mass Configuration File Mass configuration is possible with branch servers and terminals. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Migration with Complete Data Dump 2. Migration with Branch by Branch Data Dump 3. Converting XML to YAML This section describes migrating from an existing SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service 11 installation to a new Uyuni installation. You can perform this migration all at once by creating a data dump in a single file, and then moving it to the new server. Alternatively, you can perform the migration in stages by creating a data dump for each branch, and moving them to the new server one by one. Importing and deploying the converted data can also be done in one or multiple steps, depending on your environment. In this procedure, you create a single data dump in an XML file, convert it to YAML, and migrate it to the new infrastructure all at once. Install the Uyuni for Retail server 2023.02. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. On the SLEPOS Admin server export all the data stored in LDAP to an XML file. Run this command as an administrator: posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml The resulting dumpfile.xml file will contain global information, with parts about images, hardware and its partitioning, and the description of the branch servers with networking data, services, and attached terminals. Move the XML file to the newly created Uyuni server, and convert it to YAML: retail_migration dumpfile.xml retail.yml Review the generated YAML file (retail.yml) and adjust it as necessary. Consider HWTYPE group naming and image name and version changes in the partitioning data. Group names must not exceed the 56 character limit. You can shorten the names as needed, and the image names must match the images in Uyuni. The --save-mapping option can help you with this task. Also check whether there are duplicate MAC addresses of the terminals in the generated YAML file. Choose which entry you want to keep. If there are duplicate MAC addresses, importing the YAML file will fail. SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service images will not be migrated. You must rebuild the images using the OS image building functionality. For more information about building images, see 映像构建和管理. Import the complete data (YAML) with: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yml You can see statistical data while the import is in progress. Check the results in the Web UI by navigating to Systems System List All and find empty profiles. To see the groups for the hardware configuration, branches, servers, and terminals, navigate to Systems Groups. To finalize the branch server migration, you must install the branch server machines as Salt clients and bootstrap them as proxies. For more information about proxy installation, see Retail Installation. For more information about using an activation key to assign the required channels, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. After onboarded to Uyuni, the branch servers machines are connected with the empty profiles (by FQDN), and so they will get the Retail configuration. After all the branches are migrated, shutdown and remove the old SLEPOS Admin Server. In this procedure, you migrate the SLEPOS infrastructure and the branches one by one, first exporting and then importing. Install the Uyuni for Retail server 2023.02 For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. On every branch server: posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml These dumps will contain only the LDAP data of the branch, and any global data. Similarily, you can export the LDAP data of every branch if you run the command on the Admin server with the branch credentials explicitly specified: posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml --user $branch_dn \\ --password $password For background information about SLEPOS branch server configuration, see https://documentation.suse.com/sle-pos/11-SP3/html/SLEPOS-guide/cha.slepos_branchserv.html. Review the generated YAML file (retail.yml) and adjust it as necessary. Consider HWTYPE group naming and image name and version changes in the partitioning data. You can shorten the names as needed, and the image names must match the images in Uyuni. The --save-mapping option can help you with this task. Check whether there are duplicate MAC addresses of the terminals in the generated YAML file. Choose which entry you want to keep. As long as there are duplicate MAC addresses, Uyuni will refuse importing the YAML file. SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service images will not be migrated. You must rebuild the images using the OS image building functionality. For more information about building images, see 映像构建和管理. The data can be imported branch by branch. For each branch perform the following steps: Run the import command for one branch after the other: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yml --branch Repeat the command for every branch. To finalize each branch server migration, you must install the branch server machine as a Salt-based client and bootstrap it as a proxy. For more information about proxy installation, see Installing and Registering. For more information about using an activation key to assign the required channels, see Configuring Server. After onboarded to Uyuni for Retail, the branch server machine is connected with the empty profile (by FQDN), and so it will get the Retail configuration. Apply Highstate on the branch server; this will happen automatically if Configuration File Deployment is enabled. Boot the terminals of the branch. After all the branches are migrated, shut down and remove the old SLEPOS Admin Server. When you perform a migration using one of the methods in this chapter, one of the steps takes the XML data dump file from SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service, and converts it to a YAML file for Uyuni for Retail. The tool that performs this conversion has additional features, which are outlined in this section. To validate the XML file before conversion, and print any errors: retail_migration dumpfile.xml To write a mapping file called map.yml: retail_migration dumpfile.xml --save-mapping map.yml The mapping file contains two dictionaries: images, which maps old SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service images to new images built in Uyuni. groups, which maps legacy SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service scCashRegister objects to Uyuni HWTYPE groups. Group names must not exceed the 56 character limit. The mapping file should be edited as required for your environment. To perform a conversion using a mapping file: retail_migration dumpfile.xml retail.yml --mapping map.yml If you are performing a branch-by-branch migration, the resulting retail.yml file will contain a new version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service LDAP data. If you want to preserve any global changes in your Uyuni for Retail settings, remove the global hardware types from the resulting retail.yml file before importing it. Alternatively, you can import retail.yml using this command to import only the new systems and groups defined in the file, and leave any existing configuration settings untouched: retail_yaml --only-new","title":"Migrate SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service 11 to Uyuni for Retail","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-migration-slepostosuma","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-migration-slepostosuma.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Dedicated Network Architecture 1.2. External Network Architecture 1.3. Shared Network Architecture Uyuni for Retail uses a layered architecture: The first layer contains the Uyuni Server. The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services. It also contains one or more build hosts. The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see 在 openSUSE Leap 中安装 Uyuni Proxy. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements. The branch servers are in the same network as the Uyuni Server, and terminals use an isolated branch network. In this configuration, the branch servers are in the corporate network, and provide all DHCP, DNS, PXE, FTP, and TFTP services to the terminals in the branch networks. The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides PXE, FTP, and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network.

Cached Terminal Updates If the Uyuni Server is offline, you can still perform some operations on the terminals. This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded. When the terminal is rebooted and an uptodate POS image is found in the service partition, the terminal will automatically use this cached image for system redeployment.","title":"Offline Use","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-offline","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-offline.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for other purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. This guide provides an overview of Uyuni for Retail, and its initial installation and setup.

Prepare to Migrate from SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service This document is intended to guide you through migration your SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service or older Uyuni for Retail installation (3.1 or 3.2) to the newest version of Uyuni for Retail. This document is divided into scenarios. Pick the scenario that best suits your environment, and follow the instructions in that section to migrate your installation. Ensure your existing installation is fully updated, and that you have performed a backup, before you begin your migration. SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service cannot be upgraded directly to Uyuni for Retail. The migration requires you to perform some manual configuration. To assist you in the migration, as much information as possible about the existing hardware configuration and network infrastructure is recorded. Then this information is used for rebuilding the new Uyuni for Retail installation. In some cases, this will require a lengthy downtime to perform the migration. If you are not able to manage downtime, you can install new servers and run them in parallel to the existing ones while you perform the migration. This is especially relevant for large installations. It is possible to run a SLEPOS Admin server and Uyuni Server in parallel. In such a scenario, branches that have been migrated will run on the Uyuni server, while those that have not yet been migrated can continue to run on the SLEPOS Admin server. This includes all operations, such as adding new terminals, or building and deploying new images. However, if you run network services (especially DHCP) on the branch servers, you will not be able to run both old and new branch servers in parallel on the same branch, because they can conflict with each other. This can result in multiple terminals having the same IP address, or terminals randomly assigned to different branch servers. If you need to migrate in this environment, and you want to configure a new branch server while the branch is still running on old infrastructure, make sure that the new branch server is not connected to the network with the terminals. If your branch server does not provide DHCP services, you can configure the new one in parallel and, when you are ready, change the configuration of your DHCP server from the old to the new branch server.","title":"Before You Migrate","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-prepare-migration","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-prepare-migration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Naming by HWType 2. Naming by Hostname 3. Naming by FQDN 4. Assign Hostnames to Terminals Terminals can be named according to certain parameters, which can make it easier to match the physical device with its record in the Uyuni Web UI. Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, and HWType. Naming scheme can be selected in the Branch Network formula. For more information, see Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID 例如： B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID 例如： B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 例如： B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: hwAddress: hwtype: Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name.

For proxy installation procedures, see 在 openSUSE Leap 中安装 Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni Proxy 设置. Then continue with the following sections. Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. 此过程所需的产品包括： Table 1.

You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE 通道可能会非常大。同步所需的时间可能会长达数小时。 By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. 过程：在客户端上信任 GPG 密钥 On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. 打开相关的引导脚本，找到 ORG_GPG_KEY= 参数并添加所需的密钥。例如： uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. . If you are bootstrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.4 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.4 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.4 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) For more information about creating activation keys, see 激活密钥. You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。 A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see 代理注册. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. For more information about the proxy setup script, see xref:installation-and-upgrade:uyuni-proxy-setup.adoc#uyuni-proxy-setup-confproxy[]. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types. Configure the proxy to become a branch server.

会触发将 /srv/tftpboot 目录完全同步到 /etc/cobbler/settings 中配置的所有已指定代理的操作。此命令还会受到相关系统之间 WAN 连接延迟的影响。 根据 /var/log/cobbler/ 中的日志，同步过程可能需要很长时间才能完成。 例如，该过程开始时间为： Thu Jun 3 14:47:35 2021 - DEBUG | running python

Proxy 系统是通过 WAN 连接的； /srv/tftboot 包含大量发行套件文件和客户端 PXE 引导文件，总共有数千个文件； 已禁用 /etc/cobbler/settingsl 中的任一代理，否则 Uyuni 会继续将内容同步到代理。 #proxies: # - \"sumaproxy.sumaproxy.test\" # - \"sumaproxy2.sumaproxy.test\"

ethX 调整为由 Uyuni 用来与代理通讯的相应网络接口。 最后，不会捕获 ssh 通讯，从而进一步减少了软件包的数量。 开始 cobbler 同步。 要强制同步，请先删除 cobbler json 缓存文件，然后发出 cobbler sync： rm /var/lib/cobbler/pxe_cache.json cobbler sync cobbler 完成后，停止 TCPdumps。 使用 Wireshark 打开 TCPdumps，转到 Statistics（统计信息）> Conversations（对话），并等待分析转储。 切换到“TCP”选项卡。此选项卡上显示的数字是在 SUSE Manager 与 SUSE Manager Proxy 之间捕获的对话总数。 找到列 Duration（持续时间）。 首先按升序排序，找出传输文件所花费的最短时间。 继续按降序排序，找出大文件传输时间的最大值，例如内核和 initrd 传输。 忽略端口 4505 和 4506，因为它们用于 Salt 通讯。 TCPdumps 分析结果表明，将大小约为 1800 字节的小文件从 Uyuni Server 传输到 Proxy 大约花费了 0.3 秒。 此处的大文件不多，而大量的小文件导致建立了大量连接，因为每传输一个文件就要创建新的 TCP 连接。 因此，在知道最短传输时间和所需连接数（在本示例中大约为 5000）的情况下，可以大致估算出总传输时间：5000 * 0.3 / 60 = 25 分钟。","title":"对通过 WAN 连接在 Uyuni Server 与 Proxy

clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted as soon as the channel is refreshed or the first package gets installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. 由于基于 Debian 的系统仅会对元数据签名，因此不需要为各个通道指定确切的密钥。如果用户按 为软件源元数据签名 中的“使用自己的 GPG 密钥”所述配置了自己的 GPG 密钥来对元数据签名，系统会自动部署并信任该密钥。 用户可以自行定义要部署到客户端的 GPG 密钥。 通过提供某些 pillar 数据并在 Salt 文件系统中提供 GPG 密钥文件，系统会自动将它们部署到客户端。 这些密钥会分别部署到 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/（在基于 RPM 的操作系统上）和 /usr/share/keyrings/（在 Debian 系统上）中： 为您要将密钥部署到的客户端定义 pillar 键 custom_gpgkeys 并列出密钥文件名。 cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg 此外，在 Salt 文件系统中创建名为 gpg 的目录，并将 custom_gpgkeys pillar 数据中所指定的 GPG 密钥文件储存在该目录下。 ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 密钥现在会部署到客户端的 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 和 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 中。 最后一步是将 URL 添加到软件通道的“GPG 密钥 URL”字段中。请导航到软件 管理 通道，然后选择要修改的通道。将值 file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 添加到 GPG 密钥 URL中。 过程：在客户端上使用引导脚本信任 GPG 密钥 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，检查 /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ 目录的内容。此目录包含所有可用的公共密钥。记下为您正在注册的客户端指派的通道适用的密钥。 打开相关的引导脚本，找到 ORG_GPG_KEY= 参数并添加所需的密钥。例如： uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key 您无需删除任何以前储存的密钥。 信任 GPG 密钥对于客户端的安全非常重要。由管理员来决定需要哪些密钥，可以信任哪些密钥。如果不信任 GPG 密钥，便无法为客户端指派软件通道。","title":"","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"trust_gpg","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/snippets/trust_gpg.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 在客户端上信任 GPG 密钥","hash":"trust-gpg-keys-on-clients","id":1},{"text":"1.1. 用户定义的 GPG 密钥","hash":"_用户定义的_gpg_密钥","id":2},{"text":"1.2. 引导脚本中的 GPG 密钥","hash":"_引导脚本中的_gpg_密钥","id":3}]},"314":{"id":314,"text":"The Admin menu provides access to features for managing Uyuni configuration.

Configuration Channel Details Uyuni manages both central and local configuration channels and files. Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems, and is available for both traditional and Salt clients. For traditional clients, use local configuration management. Local configuration management allows you to specify overrides, and select configuration files that are not changed when the system is subscribed to a central channel. For Salt clients, use state channels. When you create a state channel, you can create or upload custom Salt states. For more information about custom Salt states, see Custom Salt States. Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel. If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the List/Remove Files page of that channel. If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the Configuration Channel Details Systems Subscribed Systems page for that channel. 概览 The Overview page of the Configuration Channel Details page is divided into several panels: Channel Properties [Management] Edit the name, label, and description of the channel by clicking Edit Properties. Channel Information Provides status information for the contents of the channel. Configuration Actions Provides access to the most common configuration tasks. For Salt clients, there is a link to edit the init.sls file. This panel allows you to deploy, compare, and add and create files. Some action are only availalble if you have files created and clients assigned to configuration channels. List/Remove Files This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel. You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels. Check the box next to files you want to manipulate, then click the action button at the bottom. Add Files The Add Files page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to Upload, Import, or Create configuration files to be included in the channel. Upload File To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the Upload Configuration File button. The Filename/Path field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed. You can set the Ownership via the user name and group name and the Permissions of the file when it is deployed. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure SELinux contexts to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type). If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro. For more information on using macros, see reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros. Import Files To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import. Then click Import Configuration Files. A sandbox icon () indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox. Files in a system’s sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable. Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel. Create File Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link to be included in the configuration channel. Deploy Files This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel. Deploy all files by clicking the Deploy All Files button or check selected files and click the Deploy Selected Files button. Select to which systems the files should be applied. All systems subscribed to this channel are listed. If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first.

Setup spacecmd Credentials 2. spacecmd Quiet Mode 3. spacecmd Help The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help ): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Creating a Distribution With spacecmd Sets Localhost Instead of FQDN 2. Spacecmd not Accepting Commands or Options 3. Spacecmd caching problems This section provides troubleshooting solutions when working with spacecmd The support article associated with this issue may be located at https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7018627 Situation When creating a distribution with spacecmd it will automatically set localhost as the server name instead of the FQDN of SUSE Manager. This will result in the following kernel option being written: install=http://localhost/ks/dist/ Resolution Set the FQDN in $HOME/.spacecmd/config like the following: test:~/.spacecmd # cat config [spacecmd] server=test.mytest.env username=admin password=password nossl=0 Cause This problem may be experienced if $HOME/.spacecmd/config has been created and the server name option was set to localhost. When running spacecmd non-interactively, you must escape arguments passed to the command. Always put -- before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments. Additionally, make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted. An example of a well-formed spacecmd command: spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \\'My Channel\\' -l channel1 -a x86_64 The spacecmd command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed. Sometimes, this can result in a mismatch between the system name and the system ID.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block//queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block//queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"481":{"id":481,"text":"Make sure the hub-xmlrpc-api service is started: systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api Once it is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Authentication Examples The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different authentication modes: Manual mode (default): API credentials must be explicitly provided for each server. Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python import xmlrpclib HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpclib.Server(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print (system) #logout client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2. Example Python Script for Relay Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python import xmlrpclib HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpclib.Server(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) #Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) #authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate) client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds) # perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print (system) #logout client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Auto-Connect Authentication Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers. However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. Listing 3.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"485":{"id":485,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Tuning Reporting Jobs 4.2. report_db_batch_size 4.3. report_db_hub_workers The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral Uyuni Servers. The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Schema documentation can be found on the Left Navigation Bar → Help Report Database Schema. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Salt Client Onboarding Rate 2. Salt Clients and the RNG 3. Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys 4. Disabling the Salt Mine 5. Disable Unnecessary Taskomatic jobs 6. Swap and Monitoring 7. AES Key Rotation This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments. Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from Salt clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured. Large installations require standard Salt clients. These instructions cannot be used in environments using traditional clients or Salt SSH minions. There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book.

Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

Memory Usage Uyuni is designed by default to work on small and medium scale installations. For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters. Description The maximum number of HTTP requests served simultaneously by Apache httpd. Proxies, Web UI, and XMLRPC API clients each consume one. Requests exceeding the parameter will be queued and might result in timeouts. Tune when User count and proxy count increase significantly and this line appears in /var/log/apache2/error_log: […​] [mpm_prefork:error] [pid …​] AH00161: server reached MaxRequestWorkers setting, consider raising the MaxRequestWorkers setting.

Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. Notes Incoming Salt events are handled in separate thread pool, see java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum number of minions concurrently executing a scheduled action. Tune when Client count reaches several thousands and actions are not executed quickly enough. Value default 200 Value recommendation 200-500 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_batch_size = 300 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information Salt Rate Limiting Description The maximum number of threads in Tomcat dedicated to handling of incoming Salt events. Tune when The number of queued Salt events grows. Typically, this can happen during onboarding of large number of minions with higher value of java.salt_presence_ping_timeout. The number of events can be queried by echo \"select count(*) from susesaltevent;\" | spacewalk-sql --select-mode-direct - Value default 8 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_event_thread_pool_size = 50 After changing Check the length of Salt event queue. Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size, as each thread consumes a PostgreSQL connection, starvation might happen if the allocated connection pool is insufficient. Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. More information man rhn.conf Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. This parameter sets the amount of time before a second command (find_job) is sent to the client to verify its presence. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 4 seconds Value recommendation 4-400 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_timeout = 40 After changing Large java.salt_presence_ping_timeout value can reduce overall throughput. This can be compensated by increasing java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information Salt Timeouts Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. After java.salt_presence_ping_timeout seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (find_job) is sent to the client for a final check. This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered offline. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for on minion (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 1 second Value recommendation 1-100 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 10 More information Salt Timeouts Description Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it. Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count increases significantly (more than 50), or more concurrent operations on channels are expected. Value default 2 Value recommendation 2-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers = 4 After changing Check taskomatic.java.maxmemory for adjustment, as every new thread will consume memory More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum amount of memory Taskomatic can use. Generation of metadata, especially for some OSs, can be memory-intensive, so this parameter might need raising depending on the managed OS mix. Tune when java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers increases, OSs are added to Uyuni (particularly Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu), or OutOfMemoryException errors appear in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log. Value default 4096 MiB Value recommendation 4096-16384 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.java.maxmemory = 8192 After changing Check memory usage. More information man rhn.conf Description The number of Taskomatic worker threads. Increasing this value allows Taskomatic to serve more clients in parallel. Tune when Client count increases significantly Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-200 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 100 After changing Check hibernate.c3p0.max_size and thread_pool for adjustment More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Cycle time for Taskomatic. Decreasing this value lowers the latency of Taskomatic. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 5000 ms Value recommendation 1000-5000 ms Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example org.quartz.scheduler.idleWaitTime = 1000 More information http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/configuration.html Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt clients as a result of actions being executed. Tune when Client count is in the thousands. Value default 1 Value recommendation 1-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.MinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 10 Description Number of Taskomatic threads dedicated to sending commands to Salt SSH clients as a result of actions being executed. Tune when Client count is in the hundreds. Value default 20 Value recommendation 20-100 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.SSHMinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = 40 Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections simultaneously available to both Tomcat and Taskomatic. If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving. Value default 20 Value recommendation 100 to 200, higher than the maximum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size + maxThreads and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example hibernate.c3p0.max_size = 100 After changing Check max_connections for adjustment. More information https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize Description The maximum amount of memory that the rhn-search service can use. Tune when Client count increases significantly, and OutOfMemoryException errors appear in journalctl -u rhn-search. Value default 512 MiB Value recommendation 512-4096 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example rhn-search.java.maxmemory = 4096 After changing Check memory usage. Description The amount of memory reserved for PostgreSQL shared buffers, which contain caches of database tables and index data. Tune when RAM changes Value default 25% of total RAM Value recommendation 25-40% of total RAM Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example shared_buffers = 8192MB After changing Check memory usage. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation 2 * hibernate.c3p0.max_size + apache MaxClients + 70, if less than 1000 Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-200 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 50 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring your own subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pay as you go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in 公有云要求. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete setup in the Uyuni Web UI.

Enable and Configure the HANA Formula 2. Enable and Configure the Cluster Formula Uyuni uses formulas with forms to configure your SAP clients. There are two formulas that you need to use: Hana to configure the HANA database Cluster to configure the clients into a cluster The formulas are provided by packages that you can download with your package manager. You need to install the formulas on the Uyuni Server. When you have installed the package, you can use the Uyuni Web UI to enable and configure the formulas. As you go through the formula configuration process, provide details of the clients that contain your SAP cluster, to set them up appropriately. To install the formulas on the Uyuni Server, use your package manager to install these packages: saphanabootstrap-formula sapnwbootstrap-formula drbd-formula habootstrap-formula salt-shaptools The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important. You must enable, configure, and apply the HANA formula first. Then you can enable, configure, and apply the cluster formula.

Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP2/html/SLES-SAP-quick/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware. For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 一般要求. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. In the Activation Key field, select the SLES for SAP activation key.

The method for installing the Uyuni Server varies depending on your hardware and environment. Uyuni is installed using the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Unified Installer. During the installation process, when you are prompted for which product to install, select Uyuni Server. The server does not need to have the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 with SAP product installed. For more information about installing the Uyuni Server, see 安装 Uyuni 2023.02 Server. When the Uyuni Server is installed, set it up by running the yast2 susemanager_setup command from the command prompt. The setup script prompts you to complete additional details about your server, and give you the URL to use to access the Web UI. For more information about setup, see SUSE Manager Server 设置. You need to do some configuration to set up the Uyuni Web UI. In your browser, navigate to the URL of the server, and configure your administration access to the Web UI. For more information about setting up the Web UI, see Web Interface Setup. Now you can use the Web UI to prepare software channels and activation keys for your clients. On the Uyuni Server, add the appropriate SAP channels: From the Web UI, add SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP. Synchronize the Uyuni Server with the SUSE Customer Center. You can do this using the Web UI. Add the new channel to your activation key. To check if a channel has finished synchronizing navigate to Admin Setup Wizard and select the Products tab. This dialog displays a completion bar for each product when they are being synchronized. Software channels can be very large. The initial channel synchronization can sometimes take up to several hours. When the initial synchronization is complete, we recommended you clone the channel before you work with it.

Custom State to Trust a GPG Key 4. Apply a custom state at highstate You can create your own custom Salt states with Uyuni as centrally managed configuration channels. Custom states are stored as Salt state files on the Uyuni Server with a .sls extension. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create and edit custom Salt state files. You must create a state channel first, with an initial state named init.sls. The init.sls file is used to reference all other state files within the channel. The custom states that you create using the Web UI are stored on the Uyuni Server in the the /srv/susemanager/salt// directory. After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state.

Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2.

Example: Remote Command ip_forward-on: cmd.run: - name: echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - onlyif: - test `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 Listing 4. Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all SUSE public keys are also saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey- deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolve saltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders.

Set Up a Branch Server Networking 1.1. Set Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN 1.2. Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network 2. Set up Branch Server Terminal Naming The Branch Network formula is used to configure the networking services required by the branch server, including DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration it is required to fill at least Branch Identification. This identifies Branch Server in Retail subsystem and is also used to better organize terminals with their respective branch servers.

Do not use this parameter in a production environment as it creates a major security hole. This parameter should be used only in a development environment for debug purposes. MASTER Overrides auto-detection of the Salt master. For example: MASTER=myproxy.domain.com SALT_TIMEOUT Overrides the local boot fallback timeout if the Salt master does not apply the saltboot state within this timeout (default: 60 seconds). For example: SALT_TIMEOUT=300 DISABLE_HOSTNAME_ID If the terminal has a hostname assigned by DHCP, it is by default used as a minion ID. Setting this option to 1 disables this mechanism, and SMBios information will be used as a minion ID. DISABLE_UNIQUE_SUFFIX Setting this option to 1 disables adding random generated suffix to terminal minion ID. If you set this parameter make sure your terminal has either a unique hostname provided by DHCP and DNS, or the terminal hardware comes with a unique serial number stored in its SMBios memory. Otherwise there is a risk of terminal minion ID duplicity, and bootstrapping the minion will fail. The following parameters (MINION_ID_PREFIX, salt_device, root) are usually autoconfigured and should be used only in specific conditions such as debugging or development: MINION_ID_PREFIX Branch ID set in the Branch Network formula form. salt_device Device that contains the Salt configuration. root Device that contains the already deployed root file system.

When there is only one disk present on target hardware (including USB drives), use an asterisk * to automatically select the disk device. When there are multiple disks, use an asterisk * in the device path. In this example, SATA disks are differentiated from USB disks: /dev/disk/by-path/*-ata-1 /dev/disk/by-path/*usb* If the entered value does not contain /, the entered value is automatically prepended by /dev/disk/by-path/. For example, *usb* is the same as /dev/disk/by-path/*usb*. If you prefer to select specific devices, you can this format in the disk device field: symbolic names (for example: /dev/sda) by-path (for example: /dev/disk/by-path/..) by-id (for example: /dev/disk/by-id/…​) To see a list of available devices from the command prompt, press Esc while waiting for key approval. msdos Disklabel Limitations On the msdos disk label, you can create a maximum of four primary partitions. Extended partitions are not supported. If you need more than four partitions, use the GPT disk label instead.

Expression language 3. Writing Salt Formulas 4. Separate Data 5. Generated Pillar Data You can also write your own custom formulas, and make them available to your clients in the Uyuni Web UI. This section contains information about writing custom formulas, including formulas with forms. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directoy also contains an optional metadata.yml file that contains additional information about a formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt// Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata// All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata//form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a : null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py The process is executed like this: The suma_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (suma_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Throughout the Uyuni documentation, we use the term Salt clients to refer to Salt machines that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server.

Batching 2. Disabling the Salt Mine Salt is able to run commands in parallel on a large number of clients. This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C.","title":"Salt Rate Limiting","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-rate-limiting","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-rate-limiting.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Repository Access with a Proxy 11. Proxy Setup Salt SSH allows Salt commands and states to be issued directly over SSH. SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://suma-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the suma-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost suma-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to suma-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:suma-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to suma-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file= minion state.apply certs,` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time.","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see 自定义系统信息. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring. When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor. To use beacons on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Salt clients, install the python-pyinotify package. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, install the python-inotify package. For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are referred to as Salt clients, in order to clearly differentiate them from traditional clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step.

General Salt timeouts 2. Presence Ping Timeouts 3. Salt SSH Clients (SSH Push) Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (presence_ping_timeout/presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here.

Install the Yomi Formula 2. Install the PXE Image 3. Register Yomi in Cobbler 4. Example Salt Pillar Preparation 5. Monitor the Installation Yomi (yet one more installer) is an installer for SUSE and openSUSE operating systems. Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp:///pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Virtual Guest List Columns Column Description Guest The name of the virtual guest System The client the virtual guest is registered to Updates Icon indicates if the guest has outstanding patches State Indicates if the guest is running, suspended, stopped, or crashed Current Memory The amount of RAM allocated to the guest vCPUs The number of virtual processors allocated to the guest Base Software Channel The base software channel the guest is registered to Action Status Any currently running action Actions Use these buttons to start, stop, or change the guest To perform bulk actions on multiple virtual guests, select the guests, and click the appropriate action button above the table. For Salt clients, click Create Guest to configure and create a new virtual guest. Virtual guests must be registered to virtual hosts. Virtual guests cannot be registered to a virtual guest. This section lists the virtual storage pools and volumes defined on the selected client. This is only available when the selected client is registered as a Salt virtual host. The list shows these columns: Table 2. Virtual Storage Pools List Columns Column Description Name The name of the virtual storage pool or volume State Indicates if the pool is running, suspended, stopped, or crashed Autostart Checked if the pool starts automatically when the virtual host is booted Persistent Checked if the pool persists between virtual host reboots Location The absolute path to the pool on the virtual host Usage The percentage of storage in use. Displays unknown if the pool is not running. Actions Use these buttons to start, stop, or change the pool Click Create Pool to configure and create a new virtual storage pool. This section lists the virtual networks defined on the selected client. This is only available when the selected client is registered as a Salt virtual host. The list shows these columns: Table 3. Virtual Networks List Columns Name The name of the virtual network State Indicates if the network is running, suspended, stopped, or crashed Autostart Checked if the network starts automatically when the virtual host is booted Persistent Checked if the network persists between virtual host reboots Bridge The name of the associated network bridge Action Status Shows the status of any pending actions Actions Use these buttons to stop, edit, or delete the network Click Create Network to configure and create a new virtual network. This section allows you to provision a new virtual guest on the selected client. This is only available when the selected client is registered as a traditional virtual host. Select the autoinstallation profile to use, name the new virtual guest, and schedule a time for the guest to be provisioned. Click Advanced Configuration for more configuration options. Click Schedule Autoinstallation and Finish to complete provisioning. This section allows you to deploy a new virtual guest on the selected client from a baremetal system. This is only available when the selected client is registered as a traditional virtual host. Type a URL to the qcow2 image to use, define the hardware requirements, and the proxy if required. Click Schedule Image Deployment to complete the deployment. You can see pending virtual guest deployments by navigating to Schedule Pending Actions.","title":"虚拟化","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"sd-virtualization","url":"/uyuni/reference/systems/system-details/sd-virtualization.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
