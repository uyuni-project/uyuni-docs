A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

The supported version for the Ansible Control Node is Ansible 11.3. It should be obtained from the operating system vendor’s official repositories. For example, on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 and SP7, Ansible is available through the Systems Management Module. For Control Nodes running operating systems other than SUSE Linux Enterprise, use Ansible shipped together with that distribution. Ansible software is also available for Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni for Retail Branch Server.

In the Web UI, on the System Details Properties page of the registered system, you must enable the Ansible Control Node system type of the Add-on System Types list. 启用 Ansible 控制节点系统类型后，通过在 Highstate 中添加 ansible 软件包即可确保在系统上安装该软件包，以及在系统细节 Ansible 选项卡中激活 Ansible 功能。 接下来，在系统细节 Ansible 控制节点页面上配置 Ansible 剧本目录和库存文件的路径。对于库存路径，可以使用标准 Ansible 库存路径 /etc/ansible/hosts。对于剧本目录，可以使用存储剧本文件的控制节点上的任何目录。剧本目录中包含 .yml 文件或含有 .yml 文件的子目录。 有关如何安装和设置 Ansible 控制节点的信息，请参见 设置 Ansible 控制节点。 定义库存路径后，您可以使用 Uyuni 检查其中的内容。 过程：从 Web UI 检查库存 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统细节 Ansible 库存 单击某个库存路径，在控制节点上实时执行库存检查。 定义剧本目录后，可以在系统细节 Ansible 剧本页面上发现剧本。 与库存检查一样，剧本发现操作也是在控制节点上实时运行。 可以在系统细节 Ansible 剧本页面中安排剧本执行。选择要执行的剧本后，可以从安排剧本执行对话框的库存路径下拉菜单中选择要执行的库存文件。如果您未选择任何内容，将使用控制节点中配置的默认库存。下拉菜单中填充了您在库存路径中定义的库存，以及在剧本目录中本地发现的库存。这些库存在剧本细节中显示为自定义库存项。您还可以输入任意库存路径。 然后，您可以选择剧本执行时间或选择操作链。最终，Uyuni 会在控制节点上将剧本作为操作来执行。可以在操作细节页面上查看操作结果。","title":"Ansible 集成","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"ansible-integration","url":"/uyuni/administration/ansible-integration.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 功能概述","hash":"at.ansible.overview","id":1},{"text":"2. 要求和基本配置","hash":"at.ansible.requirements","id":2},{"text":"3. 库存检查","hash":"at.ansible.inventory-inspection","id":3},{"text":"4. 剧本发现","hash":"at.ansible.playbook-discovery","id":4},{"text":"5. 剧本执行","hash":"at.ansible.playbook-execution","id":5}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"要设置 Ansible 控制节点，请在 Uyuni Web UI 中执行以下步骤。 To configure a client as the Ansible Control Node, the Ansible package must be installed on that system. Usually, the Ansible package should be obtained from the operating system vendor’s official repositories. For example, on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 and SP7, Ansible is available through the Systems Management Module. Procedure: Setting up Ansible Control Node on a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 or SP7 system In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Products, verify that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 x86_64 (or later) with the Systems Management Module and the required Python 3 Module are selected and synchronized. Deploy a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 (or later) client. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the Systems Overview page of the client. Select Software Software Channels and subscribe the client to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 x86_64 (or later SP), Systems Management Module and Python 3 Module channels. 选择客户端的细节 属性。在附加系统类型列表中启用 Ansible 控制节点，然后单击 更新属性。 导航到客户端概览页面，选择状态 Highstate，然后单击 应用 Highstate。 选择事件选项卡并校验 Highstate 的状态。 If you want to install a newer Ansible on a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4 or SP5 client, you must enable the Python 3 Module. Newer versions of Ansible no longer support managing nodes with outdated Python versions. If a managed node still defaults to an older Python version, you may encounter connection errors or failures during playbook runs. To address this, user should upgrade Python on the managed node, if possible and set the correct Python interpreter in the Ansible inventory or configuration. Ansible 集成工具会将剧本部署为库存文件。请为表 1 中列出的每个操作系统创建一个库存文件。 过程：创建 Ansible 库存文件 创建主机并将其添加到由 Ansible 管理的库存文件。Ansible 库存的默认路径为 /etc/ansible/hosts。 Listing 1. 库存示例 client240.mgr.example.org client241.mgr.example.org client242.mgr.example.org client243.mgr.example.org ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/some_ssh_key [mygroup1] client241.mgr.example.org client242.mgr.example.org [mygroup2] client243.mgr.example.org [all:vars] ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key 在 Uyuni Web UI 中的 Ansible 选项卡内，导航到 Ansible 控制节点，将库存文件添加到该控制节点中。 在剧本目录部分下，将 /usr/share/scap-security-guide/ansible 添加到添加剧本目录字段中，然后单击 保存。 在库存文件下，将您的库存文件位置添加到添加库存文件字段，然后单击 保存。 Listing 2. 示例 /etc/ansible/sles15 /etc/ansible/sles12 /etc/ansible/centos7 有关更多剧本示例，请参见 https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples。 过程：与 Ansible 节点建立通信 创建您要在库存中使用的 SSH 密钥。 ssh-keygen -f /etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key 将生成的 SSH 密钥复制到 Ansible 受管客户端。示例： ssh-copy-id -i /etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key root@client240.mgr.example.org 如下所示在 /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 中声明私用密钥： private_key_file = /etc/ansible/my_ansible_private_key 请将 my_ansible_private_key 替换为包含私用密钥的文件的文件名。 通过从控制节点执行以下命令来测试 Ansible 是否正常运行： ansible all -m ping ansible mygroup1 -m ping ansible client240.mgr.example.org -m ping 现在您可以运行更新。有关详细信息，请参见 合规性即代码。","title":"设置 Ansible 控制节点","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"ansible-setup-control-node","url":"/uyuni/administration/ansible-setup-control-node.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 创建 Ansible 库存文件","hash":"configure-ansible-inventory-files","id":1},{"text":"2. 与 Ansible 节点建立通信","hash":"_与_ansible_节点建立通信","id":2}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"在 Uyuni 中，您可以通过一系列审计任务来跟踪客户端。您可以检查客户端上是否安装了所有最新的公共安全补丁 (CVE)，执行订阅匹配，并使用 OpenSCAP 检查合规性。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到审计执行审计任务。 CVE（常见漏洞和披露）是对公开已知安全漏洞的修复方案。 只要有可用的 CVE，就必须在客户端上应用它们。 每个 CVE 包含一个标识号、漏洞说明以及更多信息的链接。CVE 标识号使用 CVE-YEAR-XXXX 格式。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到审计 CVE 审计 以查看所有客户端及其当前补丁状态的列表。 默认情况下，补丁数据在每天 23:00 更新。我们建议您在开始进行 CVE 审计之前刷新数据，以确保应用最新的补丁。 过程：更新补丁数据 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到管理 任务日程安排，然后选择 cve-server-channels-default 日程安排。 单击 cve-server-channels-bunch。 单击 单次运行安排 以安排任务。等待该任务完成，然后继续进行 CVE 审计。 过程：校验补丁状态 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到审计 CVE 审计。 要检查特定 CVE 的补丁状态，请在 CVE 编号字段中键入 CVE 标识符。 选择您要查看的补丁状态，或保持选中所有状态以查看所有补丁状态。 单击 审计服务器 检查所有系统，或单击 审计映像 检查所有映像。 有关此页面上使用的补丁状态图标的详细信息，请参见 CVE 审计。 对于每个系统，操作列会提供有关需要采取哪些措施才能解决漏洞的信息。如果适用，其中还会列出候选通道或补丁。您还可以将系统分配到系统集以便后续进行批处理。 可以使用 Uyuni API 来校验客户端的补丁状态。使用 audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus API 方法。有关此方法的详细信息，请参见《Uyuni API 指南》。 除了从通道数据中检索 CVE 信息外，Uyuni 现新增了一项实验性功能，可从 OVAL 文件中获取 CVE 详情。此功能当前属于技术预览阶段。 我们鼓励用户体验该功能并反馈意见，但在测试环境中完成全面测试前，暂不建议将其用于生产环境。 CVE 审计操作依赖于两个主要数据源：通道和 OVAL（开放漏洞与评估语言）。这两个数据源为 CVE 审计提供元数据，且各自具备独特作用。 通道 通道包含更新后的软件包（包括补丁），并提供针对漏洞修复所需关键补丁的洞察信息。 OVAL（技术预览） 与之相对，OVAL 数据提供漏洞本身的信息，以及导致系统容易因某个 CVE 而受到攻击的软件包。 尽管仅使用通道数据即可进行 CVE 审计，但同步 OVAL 数据可提升结果的准确性，尤其是在处理零日漏洞或部分修补的漏洞时。 OVAL 数据相比通道数据更轻量。例如，openSUSE Leap 15.4 的 OVAL 数据约有 50 MB。 仅同步 OVAL 数据时，您可执行 CVE 审计并检查系统是否容易因某个 CVE 而受到攻击，但无法应用补丁，因为补丁来自通道。 OVAL 功能的核心特性包括： 默认禁用：该功能默认处于关闭状态，用户必须通过更新配置文件 rhn.conf 并重启动相关服务来明确启用。 可回退：如果出现问题，用户可回退至基于标准通道的 CVE 审计模式。 性能考量：虽已完成初步测试，但性能仍存在优化空间，后续可能需要进一步改进。 OVAL 数据在每天 23:00 更新。我们建议您在开始进行 CVE 审计之前刷新数据，以确保获得最新的漏洞元数据。 过程：启用 OVAL 数据支持 Add or modify the following setting in file /etc/rhn/rhn.conf in the container: java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=true 重启动 Tomcat 和 Taskomatic 服务： systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic 如果遇到问题，需要回退到默认行为，请进行以下设置来禁用该功能： 过程：禁用 OVAL 数据支持 在 rhn.conf 中添加或修改以下设置： java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=false 重启动 Tomcat 和 Taskomatic 服务： systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic 过程：更新 CVE 数据 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到管理 任务日程安排，然后选择 oval-data-sync-default 日程安排。 单击 oval-data-sync-bunch。 单击 单次运行安排 以安排任务。 等待该任务完成，然后继续进行 CVE 审计。 为了能准确识别适用于特定客户端的漏洞，我们需要确定该客户端使用的操作系统产品。为此，我们将收集客户端的 CPE（通用平台枚举）作为 salt grain，并保存至数据库。 新注册客户端的 CPE 会被自动收集并保存至数据库。但对于现有客户端，需至少执行一次更新软件包列表操作。 过程：更新软件包列表 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统列表 全部，然后选择一个客户端。 依次单击软件选项卡和软件包子选项卡。 单击 更新软件包列表，更新软件包并收集客户端的 CPE。 为确保 OVAL 数据的完整性和时效性，Uyuni 仅使用各产品官方维护者提供的 OVAL 数据。以下是 OVAL 数据源列表： Table 1. OVAL 数据源 产品 数据源 URL openSUSE Leap https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval openSUSE Leap Micro SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro RedHat Enterprise Linux https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2 Debian https://www.debian.org/security/oval Ubuntu https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval OVAL 元数据仅在部分客户端（即使用 openSUSE Leap、SUSE 企业产品、RHEL、Debian 或 Ubuntu 的客户端）的 CVE 审计中使用。这是由于其他产品缺乏 OVAL 漏洞定义元数据。 客户端的 CVE 状态通常是受影响、不受影响或已修补。这些状态仅取决于 Uyuni 适用的信息。 在 Uyuni 中，以下定义适用： 受特定漏洞影响的系统 系统中安装的某个软件包版本低于标记为漏洞的相关补丁中相同软件包的版本。 不受特定漏洞影响的系统 同时包含在标记为漏洞的相关补丁中的软件包未安装在系统上。 针对某个漏洞进行了修补的系统 系统中安装的某个软件包版本等同于或高于标记为漏洞的相关补丁中相同软件包的版本。 相关补丁 Uyuni 在相关通道中已知的补丁。 相关通道 由 Uyuni 管理的通道，该通道被指派到系统、是指派到系统的克隆通道的原始通道、是链接到系统上安装的产品的通道，或者是系统的过去或将来的服务包通道。 由于 Uyuni 中使用的定义，CVE 审计结果在某些情况下可能不正确。例如，非受管通道、非受管软件包或不合规的系统可能会错误地报告结果。","title":"审计","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auditing","url":"/uyuni/administration/auditing.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

With the built-in backup and restore solution (mgradm backup) you create Uyuni backups. Information about restoring from your backups in the case of a system failure completes this chapter. Because Uyuni relies on a database as well as the installed program and configurations, it is important to back up all components of your installation. Back up your Uyuni installation regularly to prevent data loss and enable quick recovery. 无论您使用哪种备份方法，可用空间必须是当前安装使用的空间量的至少三倍。空间不足可能导致备份失败，因此请经常检查可用空间。 Skip this section if you installed Uyuni 2025.10 from scratch. With the advent of the built-in solution, the old method with the smdba backup tool is deprecated. If you migrated from an old system with smdba to the new solution, you must disable the old funtionality and remove the old backup archives. Either disable smdba before migrating (recommended) or later on the migrated Uyuni 2025.10 system. Procedure: Disabling old method with installed smdba before migration This procedure only works when smdba is still installed. On the command line of the container host, as root, execute: mgrctl exec -- smdba backup-hot --enable=off This will change archive_command in /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf as follows: archive_command = '/bin/true' Now your old system is ready to be migrated to Uyuni 2025.10. Procedure: Disabling old method on Uyuni 2025.10 after migration Use this procedure after migration, when smdba is no longer available. On the container host, as root, edit /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf and set these options: archive_mode = off archive_command = '/bin/true' Restart the container: mgradm restart 要备份 Uyuni 安装，最全面的方法是使用 mgradm backup create 命令。这种方法不仅可以节省备份管理时间，还可以在发生故障时更快地重新安装和重新同步。不过，这种方法需要大量磁盘空间，并且可能要花费很长时间才能完成备份。 命令 mgradm backup create 可备份某个目录。这个目录可以是本地目录或挂载的远程存储空间。 命令 mgradm backup create 允许自定义备份内容。有关所有可用选项，请参见 mgradm backup create --help。 Uyuni 的完整备份包含以下组件的备份： Uyuni 卷 数据库卷 podman 网络配置 podman 机密 Uyuni systemd 服务 Uyuni 容器映像 The Uyuni service is automatically stopped for the time it takes to create a full backup. The downtime can be significant. After backup is done, service is automatically restarted. Procedure: Creating full backup with mgradm backup create 在容器主机上，以 root 身份执行以下命令创建备份： mgradm backup create $path 请将 $path 替换为备份位置的路径。 mgradm backup create 工具允许创建部分备份。您可以跳过个别卷或所有卷、跳过数据库备份和映像。 特别是，当跳过数据库备份时，系统会创建备份而不停止 Uyuni 服务，备份可以作为两阶段备份流程中的一个阶段运行。 Partial backups are only considering a part of the data, and do not take potential dependencies with other parts which may not have been backed up in consideration. Therefore they cannot guarantee backup/restore consistency. Procedure: Creating partial backup by skipping database backup 在容器主机上，以 root 身份执行以下命令创建备份： mgradm backup create --skipdatabase $path 请将 $path 替换为备份位置的路径。 Procedure: Creating partial backup by skipping a volume 在容器主机上，以 root 身份执行以下命令创建备份： mgradm backup create --skipvolumes $volumes $path 请将 $path 替换为备份位置的路径。 Replace $volumes by the name of the volume name to be excluded from the backup, or by a comma separated list of volumes to be excluded. 使用 all 可以跳过所有卷（数据库卷除外）。 命令 mgradm backup 可使用 Uyuni 卷的内部列表。如果安装期间配置了其他卷，或有其他卷需要添加到备份中，则需使用 --extravolumes $volumes 指定这些卷。 Procedure: Creating backup with additional custom volume 在容器主机上，以 root 身份执行以下命令创建备份： mgradm backup create --extravolumes $volume $path 请将 $path 替换为备份位置的路径。 请将 $volumes 替换为备份中要包含的某个卷或一系列以逗号分隔的卷名称。 Procedure: Performing a manual database backup 请为备份分配永久存储空间。 在 Uyuni 容器主机的命令提示符处，以 root 身份执行以下命令： mgradm backup create --skipvolumes all --skipconfig --skipimages $path 从现有备份恢复 Uyuni 时，系统将枚举卷、映像和配置的备份以进行恢复。与创建备份的场景不同，恢复操作不使用内部卷列表，而是自动检测备份中存在的所有卷或映像。 收集待恢复项目列表后，系统会执行存在性和完整性检查。存在性检查用于确保恢复备份时不会意外覆盖现有卷、映像或配置。完整性检查通过计算备份项目的校验和完成。 两项检查均通过后，才会执行实际的备份恢复操作。 恢复操作完成后，Uyuni 服务不会自动启动。 Procedure: Restoring from an existing backup 在容器主机上以 root 身份运行以下命令，重新部署 Uyuni 服务器： mgradm stop mgradm backup restore $path mgradm start 请将 $path 替换为备份位置的路径。 验证备份操作用时可能会很长。如果可通过其他方法确保备份完整性，则可以使用 --skipverify 选项跳过验证。 如果出于某些原因需要跳过恢复备份中的某个卷，可以使用 --skipvolumes $volumes 选项。 Procedure: Recommended steps after Uyuni restore 使用 Uyuni Web UI 或在容器中的命令提示符处使用 mgr-sync 工具重新同步您的 Uyuni 储存库。您可以选择重新注册产品，或跳过注册和 SSL 证书生成部分。 On the container host, check whether you need to restore /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/. If /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/ was not in your backup, you need to restore it. If the source repository is available, you can restore [path]``/var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/_data/packages/`u with a complete channel synchronization: mgrctl exec -ti -- mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels Schedule the re-creation of search indexes next time the rhn-search service is started.

本节介绍如何设置过滤器以创建可实时修补的环境。 当您准备使用实时修补时，需要注意一些重要事项 永远只在您的系统上使用一个内核版本。 实时修补软件包与特定内核一起安装。 实时修补更新作为一个补丁交付。 后续会安装一系列新实时修补内核的每个内核补丁会显示需要重引导标志。 这些内核补丁附带实时修补工具。安装这些补丁后，需要在下一年开始之前至少重引导系统一次。 仅安装与已安装内核版本匹配的在线补丁更新。 在线补丁作为独立补丁提供。 您必须排除内核版本高于当前安装版本的所有常规内核补丁。 在此示例中，您将使用 SUSE-15-2019-1244 补丁更新您的系统。此补丁包含 kernel-default-4.12.14-150.17.1-x86_64。 需要排除所有包含较高版 kernel-default 和 kernel-default-base 的补丁。 过程：排除内核版本较高的软件包 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在过滤器名称字段中键入过滤器的名称。 例如，排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包。 在过滤器类型字段中选择补丁（包含软件包）。 在匹配器字段中选择版本大于。 在软件包名称字段中键入 kernel-default。 将纪元字段留空。 在版本字段中键入 4.12.14。 在发行版字段中键入 150.17.1。 单击 保存 以存储该过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包，然后单击 保存。 需要对 kernel-default-base 软件包重复此过程。 单击 构建 后，会创建一个新环境。新环境包含版本不高于所安装版本的所有内核补丁。 所有内核版本更高的内核补丁都将被去除。只要实时修补内核不是发行系列中的第一个，它们就仍然可用。 可以使用过滤器模板自动完成此过程。有关如何应用实时修补过滤器模板的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templates。 特定内核版本的实时修补仅可使用一年。一年后，您必须更新系统上的内核。执行以下环境更改： 过程：切换到新内核版本 确定要升级到哪个内核版本。 例如：4.12.14-150.32.1 创建新的内核版本过滤器。 分离先前创建的过滤器排除内核版本大于 4.12.14-150.17.1 的软件包并挂接新过滤器。 单击 构建 以重构建环境。新环境包含版本不高于所选新内核版本的所有内核补丁。使用这些通道的系统具有可供安装的内核更新。您需要在系统执行升级后重引导系统。新内核的有效期为一年。在当年安装的所有软件包与当前实时修补内核过滤器匹配。 在内容生命周期管理项目中，您可以使用 AppStream 过滤器将模块化储存库转换为常规储存库。为此，该过滤器会将软件包保留在储存库中，并除去模块元数据。可以在 Uyuni 中像使用常规储存库一样使用转换后的储存库。 AppStream 储存库在整个 Web UI 中原生受到支持。 因此，要使用 AppStream 储存库，不一定非要完成此过程。 AppStream 过滤器将选择要包含在目标储存库中的单个模块流。您可以添加多个过滤器来选择多个模块流。 如果您不在 CLM 项目中使用 AppStream 过滤器，则模块化源中的模块元数据将保持不变，并且目标储存库包含相同的模块元数据。只要在 CLM 项目中至少启用一个 AppStream 过滤器，所有目标储存库就会转换为常规储存库。 在某些情况下，您可能想要构建常规储存库，而不包含任何模块的软件包。要实现此目的，请使用匹配器无（禁用模块化）添加 AppStream 过滤器。这会在目标储存库中禁用所有模块。此设置非常适合用于 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 客户端，这种客户端大多数模块的默认版本均已包含在作为常规储存库提供的 AppStream 储存库中。 要使用 AppStream 过滤器，需要一个包含模块化储存库（例如 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream）的 CLM 项目。在开始之前，请确保包含所需的模块作为源。 过程：使用 AppStream 过滤器 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到您的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 或 9 CLM 项目。 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 在模块名称字段中键入模块名称。 例如 postgresql。 在流字段中键入所需流的名称。 例如 10。如果将此字段留空，则会选择模块的默认流。 单击 保存 以创建新过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，选择您的新 AppStream 过滤器，然后单击 保存。 可以使用创建/编辑过滤器表单中的浏览功能从模块化通道的可用模块流列表中选择一个模块。 过程：浏览可用模块流 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到您的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 或 9 CLM 项目。 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择等于。 单击浏览可用模块以查看所有模块化通道。 选择一个通道以浏览模块和流： 在模块名称字段中，开始键入要搜索的模块名称，或者从列表中选择。 在流字段中，开始键入要搜索的流名称，或者从列表中选择。 只能在浏览模块时选择通道。选定的通道不会与过滤器一起保存，并且不会对 CLM 过程产生任何影响。 您可以为要包含在目标储存库中的任何其他模块流创建额外的 AppStream 过滤器。会自动包含选定流所依赖的任何模块流。 请小心不要指定有冲突的、不兼容的或缺失的模块流。例如，从同一个模块中选择两个流是无效的。 过程：禁用模块化 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到您的 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 或 9 CLM 项目。 确保已包含项目的 AppStream 通道。 单击 创建过滤器 并使用以下参数： 在过滤器名称字段中键入新过滤器的名称。 在过滤器类型字段中选择模块（流）。 在匹配器字段中选择无（禁用模块化）。 单击 保存 以创建新过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器，选择您的新 AppStream 过滤器，然后单击 保存。 这样会有效从目标储存库中去除模块元数据，并排除属于模块的所有软件包。 当您使用 Web UI 中的 构建 按钮构建 CLM 项目时，目标储存库是不包含任何模块的常规储存库，其中包含来自选定模块流的软件包。 在 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 项目中完全禁用模块化可能导致环境存在缺陷，因为在 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 中，某些模块对于系统的健康运行是不可或缺的。","title":"内容生命周期管理示例","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

虽然您无法直接修改供应商通道，但可以克隆它们，然后通过添加或去除软件包和自定义补丁来修改克隆版本。可以将这些克隆的通道指派到测试客户端，以确保它们按预期工作。 默认情况下，克隆的供应商通道与原始供应商通道一致并会自动选择依赖项。您可以在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中添加以下选项来禁止自动为克隆的通道选择依赖项： java.cloned_channel_auto_selection = false 然后，当所有测试都通过后，您可以将克隆的通道升级为生产服务器。 此功能是通过一系列环境实现的，软件通道在其生命周期内可以在这些环境之间转移。大多数环境生命周期至少包括测试和生产环境，但您可以创建任意所需数量的环境。 本章介绍基本的内容生命周期过程以及可用的过滤器。有关更具体的示例，请参见 内容生命周期管理示例。 要设置内容生命周期，需要从一个项目开始。该项目定义软件通道源、用于查找软件包的过滤器，以及构建环境。 过程：创建内容生命周期项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目并单击 创建项目。 在 标签字段中输入项目的标签。 标签字段仅接受小写字母、数字、句点、连字符和下划线。 在名称字段中输入项目的描述性名称。 单击 创建 按钮以创建项目并返回项目页面。 单击 挂接/分离源。 在源对话框中选择源类型，然后选择项目的基础通道。 此时会显示所选基础通道的可用子通道，包括有关通道是必需通道还是建议通道的信息。 选中所需的子通道，然后单击 保存 返回项目页面。 您选择的软件通道现在应会显示出来。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 在筛选器对话框中，选择要挂接到项目的过滤器。 要创建新过滤器，请单击 创建新过滤器。 单击 添加环境。 在环境生命周期对话框中，为第一个环境指定名称、标签和说明，然后单击 保存。 标签字段仅接受小写字母、数字、句点、连字符和下划线。 继续创建环境，直到为整个生命周期创建了所有环境。 可以选择环境在生命周期中的顺序，方法是在创建某个环境时在在前面插入字段中选择该环境。 Uyuni 允许您创建各种类型的过滤器来控制用于构建项目的内容。使用过滤器可以选择要在构建中包含或排除哪些软件包。例如，可以排除所有内核软件包，或仅包含某些软件包的特定发行版。 支持的过滤器为： 软件包过滤 按名称 按名称、纪元、版本、发行版和体系结构 按提供的名称 补丁过滤 按建议名称 按建议类型 按摘要 按关键字 按日期 按受影响的软件包 模块 按流 在内容过滤期间不会解析软件包依赖项。 可以将多个匹配器与过滤器配合使用。哪些匹配器可用取决于所选的过滤器类型。 可用的匹配器为： 包含 匹配（必须采用正则表达式形式） 等于 大于 大于或等于 低于或等于 低于 高于或等于 每个过滤器都有一个规则参数，可将此参数设置为允许或拒绝。过滤器的处理方式如下： 如果某个软件包或补丁满足拒绝过滤器的条件，则从结果中排除它。 如果某个软件包或补丁满足允许过滤器的条件，它将包含在结果中（即使拒绝过滤器已排除它）。针对软件包的允许过滤器只会对软件包过滤器生效，而针对补丁的允许过滤器则只会对补丁过滤器生效。也就是说，您无法使用软件包过滤器将软件包添加回通过补丁过滤器过滤出的结果中，反之，也无法使用补丁过滤器将补丁添加回通过软件包过滤器过滤出的结果中。 当您想要使用一般的拒绝过滤器来排除大量软件包或补丁，并想要使用特定的允许过滤器来“挑选”特定的软件包或补丁时，此行为很有用。 内容过滤器在您的组织中是全局性的，并可以在项目之间共享。 如果您的项目已包含构建的源，当您添加环境时，该环境中会自动填充现有内容。内容是从周期中的前一个环境（如果有）提取的。如果前一个环境不存在，则将内容留空，直到再次构建了项目源。 为了帮助为某些常见方案创建过滤器，Uyuni 提供了过滤器模板。应用这些模板有助于提前创建一组针对特定用例定制的过滤器。 本节介绍可用的模板及其用法。 在包含实时修补的项目中，必须排除未来的常规内核软件包，以便仅将在线补丁软件包作为更新提供给客户端。另一方面，仍然必须包含已安装的常规内核软件包以保持系统完整性。 应用此模板会创建三个所需的过滤器来实现以下行为： 允许其中包含与基础内核版本相同的 kernel-default 软件包的补丁 拒绝其中包含 reboot_suggested 关键字的补丁 拒绝其中包含带有名称 installhint(reboot-needed) 的软件包的补丁 有关如何设置实时修补项目的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version。 过程：应用模板 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择根据 SUSE 产品实时修补。 在产品字段中，选择要为其设置实时修补的产品。 在内核字段中，从所选产品的可用版本列表中选择一个内核版本。拒绝后续常规内核补丁的过滤器将基于此版本。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择具有指定前缀的三个过滤器，然后单击 保存。 如果您想要根据特定已注册系统中安装的内核版本设置实时修补项目，可以使用根据系统实时修补模板。 应用此模板会创建三个所需的过滤器来实现以下行为： 允许其中包含与基础内核版本相同的 kernel-default 软件包的补丁 拒绝其中包含 reboot_suggested 关键字的补丁 拒绝其中包含带有名称 installhint(reboot-needed) 的软件包的补丁 有关如何设置实时修补项目的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version。 过程：应用模板 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 过滤器并单击 创建过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择根据特定系统实时修补。 在系统字段中，从列表中选择一个系统，或键入系统名称以缩小选项的范围。 在内核字段中，从所选系统上安装的版本列表中选择一个内核版本。拒绝后续常规内核补丁的过滤器将基于此版本。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 导航到内容生命周期 项目并选择您的项目。 单击 挂接/分离过滤器。 选择具有指定前缀的三个过滤器，然后单击 保存。 如果您想要在项目中包含模块化储存库中提供的所有可用模块，可以使用此过滤器模板自动添加这些模块。 应用后，此模板将为每个模块及其默认流创建一个 AppStream 过滤器。 如果从项目的页面完成此过程，则过滤器将自动添加到项目。否则，创建的过滤器可能会列在内容生命周期 过滤器中，并根据需要添加到任何项目。 可以编辑每个过滤器以选择不同的模块流，或去除所有这些过滤器以从目标储存库中排除该模块。 由于并非所有模块流都相互兼容，因此更改单个流可能会导致无法成功解析模块化依赖关系。如果发生这种情况，项目细节页面中的过滤器窗格会显示描述问题的错误，并且在选择的所有模块都兼容之前，构建按钮将会禁用。 自 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 起，模块便不再具有任何定义的默认流。因此，对 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 源使用此模板将不会有任何效果。 有关如何使用内容生命周期管理设置 AppStream 储存库的详细信息，请参见 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters。 过程：应用模板 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您的项目。 在过滤器部分，单击 挂接/分离过滤器，然后单击 创建新过滤器。 在对话框中单击 使用模板。输入将相应地更改。 在前缀字段中键入名称前缀。此值将添加到模板创建的每个过滤器的名称前面。如果在项目上下文中应用模板，则此字段中会预先填充项目标签。 在模板字段中，选择含默认值的 AppStream 模块。 在通道字段中，选择一个模块化通道以从中获取模块。此下拉列表中仅显示模块化通道。 单击 保存 以创建过滤器。 滚动到过滤器部分以查看新挂接的 AppStream 过滤器。 可以编辑/去除任何一个过滤器以根据您的需要定制项目。 创建项目、定义环境、挂接源和过滤器后，可以首次构建项目。 构建过程会将过滤器应用于挂接的源，并将过滤器克隆到项目中的第一个环境。 可以使用相同的供应商通道作为多个内容项目的源。在这种情况下，Uyuni 不会为每个克隆的通道创建新的补丁克隆版本，而是在所有克隆的通道之间共享一个补丁克隆版本。如果供应商修改了某个补丁（例如，撤回了该补丁，或者更改了补丁中的软件包），则这可能会导致问题。当您构建某个内容项目时，默认情况下，共享克隆补丁的所有通道将与原始通道同步，即使这些共享通道位于内容项目的其他环境中，或者位于您的组织的其他内容项目通道中，也是如此。可以通过在组织设置中关闭自动补丁同步来更改此行为。要在以后为共享补丁的所有通道手动同步补丁，请导航到软件 管理 通道，单击要同步的通道，然后导航到同步子选项卡。即使手动同步补丁，也会影响共享补丁的所有组织通道。 过程：构建内容生命周期项目 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到内容生命周期 项目，然后选择您要构建的项目。 在构建项目前，请确保环境可用。 查看挂接的源和过滤器，然后单击 构建。 提供版本消息以描述此构建中的更改或更新。 可以在环境生命周期部分监控构建进度。 构建完成后，环境版本号将会加

本节提供有关如何创建、管理和删除自定义通道的更多细节。您必须拥有管理员特权才能创建和管理自定义通道。 在创建自定义通道之前，请确定要将其关联到哪个基础通道，以及要为内容使用哪些储存库。 如果您需要将自定义软件包安装在客户端系统上，可以创建自定义子通道来管理它们。需要在 Uyuni Web UI 中创建通道，并为软件包创建储存库，然后将该通道指派到系统。 不要创建其中有软件包与客户端系统不兼容的子通道。 如果您要使用供应商提供的软件包，可以选择供应商通道作为基础通道。或者，选择无以将自定义通道设为基础通道。 过程：创建自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击 创建通道。 在创建软件通道页面上，为您的通道命名（例如 My Tools SLES 15 SP1 x86_64）和标签（例如 my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64）。 标签不能包含空格或大写字母。 在父通道下拉菜单中选择相关的基础通道（例如 SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64）。 确保为软件包选择兼容的父通道。 在体系结构下拉菜单中选择适当的硬件体系结构（例如 x86_64）。 根据环境的需要，在联系方法细节、通道访问控制和 GPG 字段中提供任何附加信息。 单击 创建通道。 自定义通道有时需要额外的安全设置。许多第三方供应商使用 GPG 保护软件包。如果您想要在自定义通道中使用受 GPG 保护的软件包，需要信任用来为元数据签名的 GPG 密钥。然后，可以选中包含已签名的元数据？复选框，以将软件包元数据与受信任的 GPG 密钥进行匹配。 如果远程通道和储存库已使用 GPG 密钥签名，则您可以导入并信任这些 GPG 密钥。例如，从 Uyuni Server 上的命令行执行 spacewalk-repo-sync： /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync -c <通道标签名称> -t yum This command and procedure is for temporary GPG key synchronization only. For storing the key permantenly, see this section later on. 基础 zypper 调用将导入密钥（如果已提供）。Web UI 不提供此功能。 This only works when the repository you want to mirror is set up in a special way and provides the \"key\" in the repository next to the signature. This is the case for all repositories generated by the Open Build Service (OBS). For other repositories special preparation steps are needed, as described further below. 当您创建新通道时，默认会选中启用 GPG 检查字段。如果您要将自定义软件包和应用程序添加到您的通道，请务必取消选中此字段，以便能够安装未签名的软件包。如果软件包来自不受信任的源，则禁用 GPG 检查会带来安全风险。 仅当储存库是有效的软件储存库时，才能使用 Web UI 将其添加到 Uyuni。请提前检查是否提供了所需的储存库元数据。可以使用 createrepo 和 reprepro 等工具进行这种检查。mgrpush 可帮助您将单个 RPM 推送到通道，而无需创建储存库。有关详细信息，请参见 createrepo_c 和 reprepro 的手册页。 过程：添加软件储存库 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 储存库，然后单击 创建储存库。 在创建储存库页面上，为该储存库指定标签（例如 my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo）。 在储存库 URL 字段中，提供包含 repodata 文件的目录的路径（例如 file:///opt/mytools/）。可以在此字段中使用任何有效寻址协议。 取消选中包含已签名的元数据？复选框。 可选：如果您的储存库需要客户端证书身份验证，请填写 SSL 字段。 单击 创建储存库。 仅当您要镜像的储存库中在签名旁边提供了“key”时，才能正常完成上述过程。OBS 生成的所有储存库都是这种情况，但不是由 OBS 提供的操作系统储存库并非如此。 如果您要使用的储存库不包含 GPG 密钥，您可以自己提供一个 GPG 密钥并手动将其导入密钥环。如果您使用 gpg 命令行工具将密钥导入 /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir 密钥环，将永久存储该密钥。即使清理了 chroot 环境，也会持久保存该密钥。 过程：使用 GPG 密钥创建软件储存库 On the container host, the command to import a key into the keyring, is: mgradm gpg add /path/to/gpg.key For more information, see 使用您自己的 GPG 密钥. 使用 uyuni_suite、uyuni_component 和 uyuni_arch 查询参数添加 Debian 非平面储存库。 uyuni_suite 是必需的。在 Debian 文档中，此参数也名为 distribution。使用此参数可以指定 apt 源。如果不提供此参数，则会使用原始方法。如果该参数以 / 结尾，则会将储存库标识为平面储存库。 uyuni_component 是可选的。此参数只能指定一个组件。无法列出组件。一个 apt 源项允许指定多个组件，但对于 Uyuni 无法做到这一点。对此，您必须为每个组件创建单独的储存库。 uyuni_arch 是可选的。如果将其省略，则会使用 SQL 查询为数据库中的通道计算体系结构名称。如果uyuni_arch与通道体系结构不匹配（有时体系结构命名不明确），请显式指定此参数。 下面提供了一些示例： Table 1. Debian 非平面储存库映射 类型 源行/URL apt 源行 deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ URL 映射 https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable?uyuni_suite=binary/ apt 源行 deb https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists stable

在细节选项卡上的子通道列表中，选择要关联的通道。 如果需要，您可以选择多个通道。 单击 更新激活密钥。 为了避免错过重要更新，SUSE 建议通过远程储存库更改来使您的自定义通道保持最新。 默认情况下，您创建的所有自定义通道将自动同步。具体而言，在以下情况下将发生同步： 在 UI 中或者使用 spacewalk-common-channels 将储存库添加到通道后 在执行日常任务 mgr-sync-refresh-default 的过程中，这将同步您的所有自定义通道和供应商通道。 要禁用此默认行为，请在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中设置： java.unify_custom_channel_management = 0 关闭此属性后，将不会自动执行同步，要使自定义通道保持最新，您需要： 通过导航到同步选项卡并单击 立即同步 来手动同步该通道。 在储存库选项卡中设置自动同步日程安排。 该过程开始后，可通过多种方式检查通道是否已完成同步： 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到管理 安装向导，然后选择产品选项卡。 产品同步时，此对话框将为每个产品显示一个完成栏。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与储存库关联的通道。 导航到menu:[储存库 > 同步]选项卡。储存库名称旁边会显示同步状态。 在命令提示符下检查同步日志文件： tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log 每个子通道在同步过程中会生成自身的日志。您需要检查所有基础通道和子通道日志文件，以确保同步完成。 可使用以下自定义通道同步选项： 保留已从储存库中去除的通道中的软件包 此选项会关闭严格模式。 不同步勘误 不要同步补丁。 仅同步最新软件包 仅同步最新的软件包版本。 创建可无人值守安装树 此选项准备一个随时可用于自动安装 Kickstart 的目录树。 出现任何错误时终止 如果发生错误，则停止同步。 将为每个通道永久保存这些选项。在执行同步之前，单击立即同步按钮也会保存通道选项。 如果您创建新的自定义通道但未从现有通道克隆，则创建的通道不包含任何软件包或补丁。可以使用 Uyuni Web UI 添加所需的软件包和补丁。 自定义通道只能包含克隆的或者自定义的软件包或补丁，并且这些软件包或补丁必须与通道的基础体系结构相匹配。添加到自定义通道的补丁必须适用于通道中的软件包。 过程：将软件包添加到自定义通道 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到软件包选项卡。 可选：通过导航到列出/去除选项卡查看当前包含在通道中的所有软件包。 通过导航到添加选项卡将新软件包添加到通道。 选择要为其提供软件包的父通道，然后单击 查看软件包 以填充列表。 检查要添加到自定义通道的软件包，然后单击 添加软件包。 如果您觉得选择合适，请单击 确认添加 以将软件包添加到通道。 可选：可以通过导航到软件 管理 通道，然后转到软件包 比较选项卡，将当前通道中的软件包与其他通道中的软件包进行比较。 要使两个通道相同，请单击 合并差异 按钮，然后解决任何冲突。 过程：将补丁添加到自定义通道 在

When it has processed, the imported image is listed on the Image List page. 过程：导入映像 在映像 映像列表中，单击 导入 打开导入映像对话框。 在导入映像对话框中填写以下字段： 映像存储区 要从中拉取映像进行检查的注册表。 映像名称 注册表中映像的名称。 映像版本 注册表中映像的版本。 构建主机 用于拉取和检查映像的构建主机。 激活密钥 激活密钥，它提供用于检查映像的软件通道的路径。 单击 导入 以确认。 随即会在数据库中创建映像项，并在 Uyuni 上安排检查映像操作。 处理完成后，您可以在映像列表中找到已导入的映像。它在构建列中显示了一个不同的图标，指示该映像已导入。也可以在映像的概览选项卡上看到已导入映像的状态图标。 基础容器映像 (BCI) 附带用于运行它的所有软件，但由于 BCI 为轻量级映像，它们可能不会附带您进行检查所需的所有工具和库。 在检查容器映像时，您可能会看到类似如下的错误消息： libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory BCI 适合用于除在容器构建主机上使用 Salt 捆绑包进行检查之外的其他场景，但如果您需要正常执行检查，则必须提前添加全部所需软件。 为了避免此类问题，您必须通过 Dockerfile 向映像中添加 libopenssl 并重新构建映像。 通过 libexpat 也能实现此目的。 下面是处理映像时存在的一些已知问题： 用于访问注册表或 git 储存库的 HTTPS 证书应通过自定义状态文件部署到客户端。 目前不支持使用 Docker 进行 SSH git 访问。 操作系统映像由 Kiwi 构建系统构建。输出映像可自定义，可以是 PXE、QCOW2、LiveCD 或其他类型的映像。 有关 Kiwi 构建系统的详细信息，请参见 Kiwi 文档。 Kiwi 映像构建功能适用于运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 和 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 的 Salt 客户端。 必须可在以下位置之一访问 Kiwi 映像配置文件和配置脚本： Git 储存库 HTTP 或 HTTPS 托管的 tar 存档 构建主机上的本地目录 有关 git 提供的完整 Kiwi 储存库的示例，请参见 https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage。 对于运行使用 Kiwi 构建的操作系统映像的主机，至少需要提供 1 GB RAM。具体所需磁盘空间取决于映像的实际大小。有关详细信息，请参见底层系统的文档。 要使用 Uyuni 构建各种映像，请创建并配置一个构建主机。操作系统映像构建主机是在 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15（SP2 或更高版本）或SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12（SP4 或更高版本）上运行的 Salt 客户端。 此过程将指导您完成构建主机的初始配置。 构建主机上的操作系统必须与目标映像上的操作系统匹配。 例如，在运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15（SP2 或更高版本）操作系统版本的构建主机上构建基于 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 的映像。在运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 或 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 操作系统版本的构建主机上构建基于 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 的映像。 无法实现跨体系结构的构建。例如，必须在运行 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 的 Raspberry PI（aarch64 体系结构）构建主机上构建 Raspberry PI SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 映像。 过程：在 Uyuni Web UI 中配置构建主机 在系统 概览页面中选择要指定为构建主机的客户端。 Navigate to the System Details Properties tab, and check the Add-on System Type > OS Image Build Host box. Confirm with Update Properties. 导航到系统细节 软件 软件通道，根据构建主机版本启用所需的软件通道。 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 构建主机需要 Uyuni 客户端工具（SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool 和 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates）。 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 构建主机需要 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 模块 SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP4-Pool 和 SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP4-Updates。 配置日程安排，然后单击 确认。 通过应用 Highstate 安装 Kiwi 和所有必需的软件包。在系统细节页面中选择状态 Highstate，然后单击 应用 Highstate。或者，从 Uyuni Server 命令行应用 Highstate： salt '$your_client' state.highstate 构建主机置备将 Uyuni 证书 RPM 复制到构建主机。此证书用于访问 Uyuni 提供的储存库。 该证书由 mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage 打包脚本打包在 RPM 中。在全新安装 Uyuni 期间会自动调用该打包脚本。 当您升级 spacewalk-certs-tools 软件包时，升级方案会使用默认值调用该打包脚本。但是，如果证书路径已更改或不可用，请在升级过程完成后使用 --ca-cert-full-path <证书路径> 手动调用该打包脚本。 /usr/sbin/mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage --ca-cert-full-path /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT 包含证书的 RPM 软件包存储在 Salt 可访问的目录中，例如： /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm 包含证书的 RPM 软件包在本地构建主机储存库中提供： /var/lib/Kiwi/repo 在构建源中指定包含 Uyuni SSL 证书的 RPM 软件包，并确保您的 Kiwi 配置包含 rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage 作为 bootstrap 部分中必需的软件包。 Listing 1. config.xml ... <packages type=\"bootstrap\"> ... <package name=\"rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage\" bootinclude=\"true\"/> </packages> ... 创建与通道（在构建映像时操作系统映像可将其用作储存库）关联的激活密钥。 必须提供激活密钥才能构建操作系统映像。 To build OS Images, you need an activation key that is associated with a channel other than Default activation key. 过程：创建激活密钥 在 Web UI 中，选择系统 激活密钥。 单击创建密钥。 输入说明和密钥名称，并使用下拉框选择要与该密钥关联的基础通道。 单击 创建激活密钥 确认。 有关详细信息，请参见 激活密钥。 OS Images can require a significant amount of storage space. By default, the image store is using the srv-www volume. 目前不支持 Kiwi 构建类型的用于构建系统映像、虚拟映像和其他映像的映像存储区。 The image files can be downloaded from https://UYUNI-HOST/os-images/ORGANIZATION-ID/FILE-NAME. The exact location can be determined from the image details page. 使用 Web UI 管理映像配置文件。 过程：创建映像配置文件 要创建映像配置文件，请在映像 配置文件中选择，然后单击 创建。 在标签字段中，提供映像配置文件的名称。 使用 Kiwi 作为映像类型。 系统会自动选择映像存储区。 输入包含 Kiwi 配置文件的目录的 配置 URL。例如，git URI（如 https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master:OSImage/SLE-Micro54）。其他选项包括 HTTP 或 HTTPS 托管的 tar 存档或构建主机上的本地目录。有关详细信息，请参见本节末尾的源格式选项。 根据需要输入 Kiwi 选项。如果 Kiwi 配置文件指定了多个配置文件，请使用 --profile <name> 选择活动配置文件。有关其他选项，请参见 Kiwi 文档。 选择一个激活密钥。激活密钥可确保将使用配置文件的映像指派到正确的通道和软件包。 将激活密钥与映像配置文件相关联，以确保映像配置文件使用正确的软件通道和任何软件包。 单击 创建 按钮确认。 源格式选项 指向储存库的 git/HTTP(S) URL 指向公用或私用 git 储存库的 URL，该储存库包含要构建的映像的源代码。根据储存库的布局，该 URL 可能是： https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles 可以在 URL 中的 # 字符后面指定一个分支。此示例使用了 master 分支： https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master 可以在 : 字符后面指定包含映像源的目录。此示例使用了 OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6： https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles#master:OSImage/POS_Image-JeOS6 指向 tar 存档的 HTTP(S) URL 指向托管在 Web 服务器上的 tar 存档（压缩或未压缩）的 URL。 https://myimagesourceserver.example.org/MyKiwiImage.tar.gz 构建主机上的目录的路径 输入包含 Kiwi 构建系统源的目录的路径。此目录必须在选定的构建主机上存在。 /var/lib/Kiwi/MyKiwiImage Kiwi 源至少包含 config.xml。通常其中还有 config.sh 和 images.sh。源还可以包含要安装在 root 子目录下的最终映像中的文件。 有关 Kiwi 构建系统的信息，请参见 Kiwi 文档。 SUSE 在 SUSE/manager-build-profiles 公共 GitHub 储存库中提供了功能齐备的映像源的示例。 Listing 2.

在供应商发布某个新补丁后，该补丁在某种情况下可能会产生不利的负面影响（在安全性、稳定性方面），而这种情况并未通过测试识别出来。如果出现这种情况（非常罕见），供应商通常会发布新补丁，此过程可能需要数小时甚至数日时间，具体取决于该供应商实施的内部流程。 SUSE 引入了一个称为已收回补丁的新机制 (2021)，可以通过将此类补丁的建议状态设置为已收回（而不是最终或稳定）来近实时地撤消这些补丁。 如果某个补丁的建议状态属性设置为 retracted，则会收回该补丁。如果某个软件包属于已收回的补丁，则会收回该软件包。 无法在包含 Uyuni 的系统上安装已收回的补丁或软件包。安装已收回软件包的唯一方法是使用 zypper install 并指定确切的软件包版本来手动安装。例如： zypper install vim-8.0.1568-5.14.1 Uyuni Web UI 中的 图标描绘了补丁和软件包的已收回状态。例如，查看： 通道中软件包的列表 通道中补丁的列表 收回安装在系统上的补丁或软件包时， 图标也会显示在该系统的已安装软件包列表中。Uyuni 不提供降级此类补丁或软件包的方法。 使用克隆的通道时，必须小心将原始通道的已收回建议状态传播到克隆版本。 将供应商通道克隆到组织中时，也会克隆通道补丁。 当供应商收回通道中的补丁并且 Uyuni 同步此通道（例如，通过夜间作业）时，retracted 属性不会传播到克隆的补丁，并且订阅克隆通道的客户端看不到该属性。要将该属性传播到克隆的通道，请使用以下方法之一： 补丁同步（软件 管理 克隆的通道 补丁 同步）。使用此功能可使克隆通道中补丁的属性与其原始通道保持一致。 内容生命周期管理。有关内容生命周期管理上下文中克隆的通道的详细信息，请参见 软件通道。 当您在组织中创建多个供应商通道克隆版本时，补丁不会克隆多次，而是在克隆的通道之间共享。因此，当您同步克隆的补丁时（使用补丁同步功能或上面提到的内容生命周期管理），使用该克隆补丁的所有通道都会看到这种变化。 示例： 假设有两个内容生命周期管理项目：prj1 和 prj2 这两个项目都有 2 个环境：dev 和 test 这两个项目都有一个设置为源通道的供应商通道 此场景中的所有通道（总共四个克隆的通道）与供应商通道的最新状态相一致 供应商收回源通道中的某个补丁，夜间作业将此补丁同步到 Uyuni 四个通道都看不到这种变化，因为它们使用的是补丁克隆版本，而不是直接使用该补丁。 在您同步补丁（构建这两个项目中的任何一个，或者对四个克隆通道中的任何一个使用补丁同步功能）后，由于补丁共享的原因，所有克隆的通道都会发现该补丁已收回。","title":"补丁管理","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"patch-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/patch-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In Uyuni, RBAC ensures that users can only perform actions and access resources for which they have explicit authorization, enhancing security and simplifying administration. The core principles of RBAC include: Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary access rights for users to perform their tasks. Granular Control: Providing fine-grained control over specific functionalities. Separation of Duties: Preventing a single user from having too much control over critical processes. Auditability: Allowing for clear tracking of user actions and permissions. Understanding the following core concepts is crucial for effective RBAC management: Role: A collection of permissions defining a specific set of capabilities within Uyuni. Roles are assigned to users, granting the user aggregated permissions. Permission: An atomic authorization to perform a specific action, access a specific web page or call a specific API endpoint within Uyuni. In Uyuni, permissions are represented by namespaces and their access modes. User: An individual account that interacts with Uyuni. Users are assigned one or more roles. Namespace: A granular unit of access control organized in a tree-like structure. Most namespaces have distinct \"View\" or \"Modify\" modes. Uyuni provides predefined roles and allows for the definition of additional custom roles, optionally inheriting from a combination of other roles. Refer to administration:users.adoc#administrator-roles for a complete list of predefined roles and their descriptions. To define additional roles, you can: Select a number of existing roles to inherit permissions from. Specify additional namespaces to grant access to. Namespaces provide fine-grained access control, organized in a tree-like structure. For most namespaces, access within a namespace is further granularized by \"View\" and \"Modify\" modes. Table 1. Example: Image Management namespaces and access modes Namespace Access Mode Description cm.build Modify Build container or Kiwi images cm.image.import Modify Import container images from a registered image store cm.image.list View List all images cm.image.list Modify Delete images cm.image.overview View View image details, patches, packages, build log and cluster information cm.image.overview Modify Inspect, rebuild, delete images cm.profile.details View View details of an image profile cm.profile.details Modify Create image profiles, edit profile details cm.profile.list View List all image profiles cm.profile.list Modify Delete image profiles cm.store.details View View details of an image store cm.store.details Modify Create image stores, edit store details cm.store.list View List all image stores cm.store.list Modify Delete image stores A comprehensive list of namespaces and their descriptions can be retrieved by making a call to the access.listNamespaces API method. Refer to Uyuni API documentation for detailed information, including request and response formats. Managing RBAC roles and permissions is currently only possible through the API. To assign roles to users via the web UI, refer to 用户. The Uyuni API provides methods for programmaticaly managing roles, permissions and user assignments. These API methods manage roles and their associated access: listNamespaces: Lists available namespaces, access modes and their descriptions in Uyuni. listPermissions: Lists permitted namespaces of a role. listRoles: Lists existing roles in Uyuni. createRole: Creates a new role, optionally copying permissions from existing roles. deleteRole: Deletes a role. grantAccess: Grants access to namespaces. revokeAccess: Revokes access to namespaces. These API methods manage user-role assignments: listPermissions: Lists effective permissions of a user. listRoles: Lists a user’s assigned roles. addRole: Assigns a role to a user. removeRole: Removes a role from a user. For detailed API documentation, including request and response formats, refer to Uyuni API reference. Adhering to these best practices will help maintain a secure, efficient, and manageable RBAC environment: Principle of least privilege: Always grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their duties. Avoid overly broad permissions. Regular review: Periodically review assigned roles and permissions for users to ensure they are still appropriate and comply with current security policies. Document roles: Clearly document the purpose and permissions of each custom role you create. Separate duties: Implement roles that enforce separation of duties to prevent a single user from having too much control over critical processes.","title":"Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"role-based-access-control","url":"/uyuni/administration/role-based-access-control.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6。您还可以将 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 或 CentOS 等客户端升级到 SUSE Liberty Linux。 要进行产品迁移，客户端上启用的以及应该迁移的所有储存库都必须有效，否则迁移将会中止。 Uyuni supports the following migration paths: 产品迁移用于在同一主要版本内升级。您无法通过产品迁移从 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 迁移到 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15。有关主要升级的详细信息，请参见 主要版本升级。 您还可以将 openSUSE Leap 迁移到更高的次要版本或对应的 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SP 级别，例如： 从 openSUSE Leap 15.5 迁移到 15.6 从 openSUSE Leap 15.6 迁移到 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 You can also migrate SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to the corresponding SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications SP level, for example: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP5 在 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 及更高版本中，SUSE 支持跳过服务包（如果 SUSE Customer Center 提供该服务包）。例如，您可以从 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 升级到 SP2，而无需安装 SP1。 For supported SUSE Linux Enterprise Server upgrade paths, see https://documentation.suse.com/en-us/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html#sec-upgrade-paths-supported. 迁移时会自动启用所有建议的扩展。 迁移期间，Uyuni 会在安装前自动接受任何必要的许可协议 (EULA)。 开始迁移产品之前： 确保没有待处理更新或补丁。请检查客户端系统细节 概览页面上的系统状态，然后安装提供的所有更新或补丁。如果您的客户端系统不是最新的，产品迁移可能会失败。 确保目标产品的所有通道都已完全同步。要在 Web UI 中检查同步状态，请导航到管理 安装向导 产品页面。 请确保您具有有效的系统备份，以防万一。产品迁移没有回滚功能。迁移过程一旦开始，就无法回滚。 过程：执行单系统迁移 从系统 概览页面中，选择一个客户端。 从客户端的系统细节页面，导航到软件 产品迁移选项卡。 选择目标迁移路径，然后单击 选择通道。 从产品迁移 - 通道页面选择正确的基础通道，包括必需的子通道和任何其他可选的子通道。 可选：选中允许供应商更改，以允许安装供应商发生更改的软件包。如果发生此情况，开始迁移前会显示一条包含相关细节的通知。 要将 openSUSE Leap 迁移到 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server，必须选中允许更改供应商选项。 正确配置您的通道后，单击 安排迁移。 如果您要将大量客户端迁移到下一 SP 版本，可以使用 Uyuni API 调用。 spacecmd 命令行工具提供了 system_scheduleproductmigration 子命令，可用于安排将大量客户端迁移到下一次要版本。 产品大量迁移操作非常危险，该过程应经过全面测试。至少应先进行试运行。 请务必小心，不要无意中升级系统。 过程：执行产品大量迁移 列出可用的迁移目标，并记下要迁移的系统 ID： spacecmd api -- system.listMigrationTargets -A 1000010001 针对每个系统 ID 调用 listMigrationTarget，并查看所需的目标产品是否可用。 如果系统 ID 有可用目标，则调用 system. scheduleProductMigration。 如果所需目标不可用，则跳过该系统。 根据您的环境调整以下模板： target = '[....]' basechannel = 'channel-label' system_ids = [1, 2, 3] session = auth.login(user, pass) for system in system_ids if system.listMigrationTargets(session, system).ident == target system.scheduleProductMigration(session, system, target, basechannel, [] , False, <now>) else print \"无法迁移到请求的目标 -- 正在跳过系统\" endif endfor 对于此示例，将会创建一个组，以便于进行大量迁移。 过程：创建大量产品迁移组 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到系统 系统组，然后单击 创建组。 将该组命名为 mpm-target-sles15sp3。 您应该仅将订阅了相同基础通道的系统添加到创建的组中。本示例只会将订阅了 SLE-Product-SLES15-SP2-Pool for x86_64 的系统添加到该组中。 有关将客户端添加到组的详细信息，请参见 系统组。 过程：将系统添加到组 运行以下命令，以获取该组中所有系统的目标： spacecmd -- system_listmigrationtargets group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 命令的输出为由多个 ID 组成的字符串。 请只选择一个目标，这样为所有系统报告的就是该目标。 该字符串是另一个命令的 MIGRATIONTARGET 的标识符。 spacecmd 的子命令 system_scheduleproductmigration 和 system_listmigrationtargets 会遍历该组中的所有系统。 如果该组中有 100 个系统，您会发现安排了 100 个操作。 该组中的所有系统都必须支持相同的迁移目标。 过程：运行大量迁移命令 system_scheduleproductmigration 命令的语法如下： spacecmd -- system_scheduleproductmigration <SYSTEM> <BASE_CHANNEL_LABEL> \\ <MIGRATION_TARGET> [选项] 对于此示例，要将 mpm-target-sles15sp3 组中的所有系统从 SLES 12 SP2 升级到 SLES 15 SP3，请在命令行上输入以下命令： spacecmd -- system_scheduleproductmigration group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 \\ sle-product-sles15-sp3-pool-x86_64 \"[190,203,195,1242]\" -d 要查看 system_scheduleproductmigration 的语法和选项，请运行以下命令： spacecmd system_scheduleproductmigration help <SYSTEM> 对于此示例，我们将使用我们创建的组选择该组中的所有系统： group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 <BASE_CHANNEL_LABEL> 这是目标基础通道的标签。在本例中，系统将升级到 SLES 15 SP3，且标签为 sle-product-sles15-sp3-pool-x86_64。 要查看当前镜像的所有基础通道的列表，请运行以下命令： spacecmd softwarechannel_listbasechannels 请注意，除非通道是当前基础通道的可用目标，否则您无法升级到该通道。 <MIGRATION_TARGET> 要为 group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 组中的系统确定此值，请运行以下命令： spacecmd -- system_listmigrationtargets group:mpm-target-sles15sp3 必须采用以下格式传递 MIGRATION_TARGET 参数；请注意需要使用引号将其括住以防中括号会产生问题： \"[190,203,195,1242]\" 选项 -s START_TIME -d 如果您要执行试运行，请传递此标志（建议在实际执行迁移前执行试运行） -c CHILD_CHANNELS（逗号分隔的子通道标签（不带空格）） 在本例中，我们包含了 -d 选项，在成功执行试运行后可以将其去除。 如果成功，安排的每个系统的命令输出将如下所示： 正在为以下系统安排产品迁移 mpm-sles152-1 已安排操作 ID：66 可以在 Web UI

Ensure you specify the correct architecture: mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-common-channels \\ -a <architecture> \\ <base_channel_name> \\ <child_channel_name_1> \\ <child_channel_name_2> \\ ... <child_channel_name_n> If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels on the container host with the following command: mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-repo-sync -p <base_channel_label>-<architecture> 确保同步已完成，然后再继续操作。 spacewalk-common-channels 提供的客户端工具通道来自 Uyuni 而非 SUSE。 如果您使用的是模块化通道，则必须在客户端上启用 Python 3.6 模块流。如果不提供 Python 3.6，spacecmd 软件包安装将会失败。 您可能会发现 AppStream 通道中提供的软件包数量在上游通道和 Uyuni 通道之间存在一定的差异。如果您对在不同时间添加的同一通道进行比较，会发现其数量也不相同。这是由 CentOS 管理其储存库的方式所致。当有新版本发布时，CentOS 会去除软件包的较旧版本，而 Uyuni 则会保留所有版本，无论新旧与否。 过程：通过 Web UI 检查同步进度 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与储存库关联的通道。 导航到储存库选项卡，然后单击同步并选中同步状态。 过程：通过命令提示符检查同步进度 To list available logs before tailing, on the container host, run the following command: mgrctl exec ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/ At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log 每个子通道在同步过程中会生成自身的日志。您需要检查所有基础通道和子通道日志文件，以确保同步完成。 您需要创建与您的 CentOS 通道关联的激活密钥。 有关激活密钥的详细信息，请参见 激活密钥。 安装软件包之前，客户端会使用 GPG 密钥检查这些软件包的真实性。只有可信软件才能安装在客户端上。 信任 GPG 密钥对于客户端的安全非常重要。由管理员来决定需要哪些密钥，可以信任哪些密钥。这是因为如果不信任 GPG 密钥，便无法使用软件通道，是否将通道指派给客户端取决于是否信任密钥。 有关 GPG 密钥的详细信息，请参见 GPG 密钥。 CentOS 7 will fail to onboard due to the fact that the /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo has URLs enabled, and thus causing yum to attempt to find the repositories using fastmirror. This will cause the bootstrap to fail with the error message: Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error To avoid the issue you can remove the CentOS-Base.repo file with the command: rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo Or, if the file needs to remain, you can add enabled=0 to each of the URL sections. In either case, then rebootstrap. 要注册您的客户端，需要有引导储存库。系统默认会自动创建引导储存库，并且每天会为所有同步的产品重新生成该储存库。您可以在容器主机的命令提示符处手动创建引导储存库： mgrctl exec -ti mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。 本节仅适用于非容器化 Uyuni，在 CentOS 7 生命周期结束后将被去除。 当您更新 CentOS 客户端时，软件包不包含有关更新的元数据。您可以使用第三方勘误服务来获取此信息。 CEFS 的作者会按照尽力而为的原则提供补丁或勘误，希望它们有用，但无法保证其正确性或及时性。这意味着补丁日期可能不正确，且至少在一种情况下所显示的发布数据滞后一个多月。有关这些情况的详细信息，请参见 https://github.com/stevemeier/cefs/issues/28#issuecomment-656579382 和 https://github.com/stevemeier/cefs/issues/28#issuecomment-656573607。 任何有关补丁数据的问题或滞后都可能导致将不可靠的补丁信息导入到您的 Uyuni 服务器中， 进而导致报告、审计、CVE 更新或其他与补丁相关的信息也不正确。请考虑使用其他方案来替代此服务，例如独立校验补丁数据或选择其他操作系统，具体取决于您的安全相关要求和认证准则。 过程：安装勘误服务 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，以 root 身份添加 sle-module-development-tools 模块： SUSEConnect --product sle-module-development-tools/15.2/x86_64 安装勘误服务依赖项： zypper in perl-Text-Unidecode 在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 中添加或编辑下面一行： java.allow_adding_patches_via_api = centos7-x86_64-updates,centos7-x86_64,centos7-x86_64-extras 重启动 Tomcat： systemctl restart tomcat 为勘误脚本创建一个文件： touch /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh 编辑新文件以包含此脚本，并视需要编辑储存库细节。 此脚本会从外部勘误服务提取勘误细节，将其解压缩，然后发布这些细节： #!/bin/bash mkdir -p /usr/local/centos cd /usr/local/centos rm *.xml wget -c http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata.latest.xml wget -c https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2/RHEL7/rhel-7.oval.xml.bz2 bzip2 -d rhel-7.oval.xml.bz2 wget -c http://cefs.steve-meier.de/errata-import.tar tar xvf errata-import.tar chmod +x /usr/local/centos/errata-import.pl export SPACEWALK_USER='<adminname>';export SPACEWALK_PASS='<password>' /usr/local/centos/errata-import.pl --server '<servername>' \\ --errata /usr/local/centos/errata.latest.xml \\ --include-channels=centos7-x86_64-updates,centos7-x86_64,centos7-x86_64-extras \\ --publish --rhsa-oval /usr/local/centos/rhel-7.oval.xml 设置 cron 作业以每日运行该脚本： ln -s /usr/local/bin/cent-errata.sh /etc/cron.daily 有关此工具的详细信息，请参见 https://cefs.steve-meier.de/。","title":"注册 CentOS 客户端","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-centos","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-centos.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":1},{"text":"2. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":2},{"text":"3. 创建激活密钥","hash":"_创建激活密钥","id":3},{"text":"4. 管理 GPG 密钥","hash":"_管理_gpg_密钥","id":4},{"text":"5. 注册客户端","hash":"_注册客户端","id":5},{"text":"6. 管理勘误","hash":"_管理勘误","id":6}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"本节包含有关注册运行 Debian 操作系统的客户端的信息。 可以通过引导 Debian 客户端来执行初始状态的运行以及配置文件的更新。 您需要完成一些准备工作，然后才能将 Debian 客户端注册到 Uyuni 服务器： 确保 DNS 配置正确并提供客户端对应的项。或者，您也可以配置 Uyuni 服务器和客户端上的 /etc/hosts 文件，在其中添加相应的项。 注册前，客户端的日期和时间必须已与 Uyuni 服务器同步。 将 Debian 客户端注册到您的 Uyuni 服务器之前，您需要添加所需的软件通道，并同步这些通道。 下面的小节中的说明通常默认使用 x86_64 体系结构。请根据情况将其替换为其他体系结构。 此过程所需的通道包括： Table 1.

捆绑包是单个二进制软件包，包含Salt 受控端、Python 3、所需的 Python 模块和库。 Salt 捆绑包随附 Python 3 以及运行 Salt 所需满足的所有条件。因此 Salt 捆绑包不会将客户端上安装的 Python 版本用作系统软件。Salt 捆绑包可以安装在不满足指定 Salt 版本的要求的客户端上。 此外，还可以在所运行 Salt 受控端连接到 Uyuni Salt 主控端以外的 Salt 主控端的系统上使用 Salt 捆绑包。 推荐使用 Salt 捆绑包来注册客户端。本节介绍当前实现的优点和局限性。 Salt 捆绑包以 venv-salt-minion 软件包的形式提供，该软件包包含 Salt、Python 3 和 Salt 所依赖的 Python 模块。 通过 Web UI 进行引导也会使用 Salt 捆绑包，因此通过 Web UI 进行引导不依赖于 Python。使用 Salt 捆绑包时，客户端不再需要提供任何 Python 解释器或模块。 如果您引导新客户端，默认的注册方法是使用 Salt 捆绑包注册。您可以将现有客户端切换为使用 Salt 捆绑包方法。如果切换，将会安装 salt-minion 软件包及其依赖项。 可以同时使用 Salt 捆绑包与由 Uyuni 服务器以外的 Salt 主控端管理的 Salt 受控端。如果将 Salt 捆绑包安装在客户端上，Uyuni 服务器将会管理 Salt 捆绑包的配置文件，在此情况下，salt-minion 的配置文件将不会受到管理。有关详细信息，请参见 Salt 捆绑包配置。 如果某个客户端的 Salt 受控端由 Uyuni 服务器以外的 Salt 主控端进行管理，要引导该客户端，建议在生成引导脚本时使用 mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle，或在引导脚本中将 FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION 设为 1。 要使用 Web UI 进行引导，可以全局指定 mgr_force_venv_salt_minion 设为 true 的 pillar。有关详细信息，请参见 Salt States and Pillars。 可以使用 Salt 状态 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 从 salt-minion 切换到 venv-salt-minion。建议分两步来切换到 venv-salt-minion，以免在切换过程中出现任何问题： 过程：使用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 状态切换到 venv-salt-minion 首先，在不指定任何 pillar 的情况下应用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion。这样会通过复制配置文件等数据切换到 venv-salt-minion。此过程不会清理原始的 salt-minion 配置及其软件包。 salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 在 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt 设为 True（用于去除 salt-minion）以及 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files 设为 True（用于去除与 salt-minion 相关的所有文件）的情况下应用 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion。此第二步用于确保第一步已经处理，然后去除旧配置文件以及现已过时的 salt-minion 软件包。 salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' 如果切换过程中跳过第一步来运行第二步，状态应用过程可能会失败，因为此过程需要停止用于在客户端执行命令的 salt-minion。 您也可以不安装 Salt 捆绑包，而是继续使用 salt-minion。在此情况下，请指定以下其中一个选项： 指定 --no-bundle 选项来执行 mgr-bootstrap。 在生成的引导脚本中，将 AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION 设为 1。 For bootstrap state set the mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillar to True in /srv/pillar/salt_bundle_config.sls. 在对客户端执行 SSH 推送操作时，也可使用 Salt 捆绑包。 在执行任何 Salt 命令前，外壳脚本会将 Salt 捆绑包部署到目标系统上，而不会安装 venv-salt-minion。由于 Salt 捆绑包包含整个 Salt 代码库，因此不会部署 salt-thin。SSH 推送（包括使用 Web UI 进行引导）使用捆绑包中的 Python 3 解释器。目标系统上不需要安装任何其他 Python 解释器。 随该捆绑包部署的 Python 3 用于处理客户端上的 SSH 推送会话，因此 SSH 推送（包括使用 Web UI 进行引导）不依赖于在系统上安装 Python。 可以将 salt-thin 用作一种后备方法，但这种方法需要在客户端上安装 Python 3。不建议也不支持使用此方法，此方法仅用于开发目的。请在 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 配置文件中将 web.ssh_use_salt_thin 设为 true。 使用 Web UI 引导客户端之前必须创建引导软件源。SSH 推送使用根据检测到的目标操作系统从引导软件源获取的 Salt 捆绑包。有关详细信息，请参见client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository。 SSH 推送使用 /var/tmp 在安装了捆绑 Python 的客户端上部署 Salt 捆绑包和执行 Salt 命令。因此，切勿使用 noexec 选项挂载 /var/tmp。无法通过 Web UI 引导使用 noexec 选项挂载 /var/tmp 的客户端，因为引导过程使用 SSH 推送来访问客户端。 Salt 捆绑包提供了 pip，使用该命令可以通过额外的 Python 软件包扩展捆绑 Salt 受控端的功能。 默认情况下，salt <minion_id> pip.install <package-name> 会将 <package_name> 指定的 Python 软件包安装到 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local 中。 如果需要，可以通过为 venv-salt-minion.service 设置 VENV_PIP_TARGET 环境变量来覆盖路径 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local。建议为该服务使用 systemd 普适性配置文件。可以使用配置文件 /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf 来实现该目的： [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip 更新 Salt 捆绑包时，通过 pip 安装的 Python 软件包不会发生变化。为了确保更新后这些软件包可用且可正常运行，建议在 Salt 捆绑包更新后在应用了 Salt 状态的情况下安装这些软件包。","title":"Salt

的系统仅会对元数据签名并使用校验和链来保障软件包的安全。大多数基于 RPM 的系统除了使用已签名软件包外，还会使用已签名元数据。 操作系统要么直接信任自己的 GPG 密钥，要么至少将它们与最小系统一起安装，但通过其他 GPG 密钥签名的第三方软件包需要手动处理。客户端可以在不信任 GPG 密钥的情况下成功引导，但除非密钥受信任，否则您将无法安装新的客户端工具软件包或更新软件包。 客户端现在使用为软件通道输入的 GPG 密钥信息来管理受信任密钥。如果将具有 GPG 密钥信息的软件通道指派给客户端，当通道刷新后或从此通道安装第一个软件包后，系统就会信任该密钥。 软件通道页面中的 GPG 密钥 URL 参数可以包含以空格分隔的多个密钥 URL。如果其为文件 URL，则必须在使用软件通道之前在客户端上部署 GPG 密钥文件。 基于 Red Hat 的客户端的客户端工具通道的 GPG 密钥会部署到客户端的 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ 中，并可通过文件 URL 引用。 仅当为客户端指派了软件通道时，系统才会导入并信任这些密钥。 由于基于 Debian 的系统仅会对元数据签名，因此不需要为各个通道指定确切的密钥。如果用户按 储存库元数据 中的“使用自己的 GPG 密钥”所述配置了自己的 GPG 密钥来对元数据签名，系统会自动部署并信任该密钥。 用户可以定义要部署到客户端的自定义 GPG 密钥。 通过提供某些 pillar 数据并在 Salt 文件系统中提供 GPG 密钥文件，系统会自动将它们部署到客户端。 这些密钥会分别部署到 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/（在基于 RPM 的操作系统上）和 /usr/share/keyrings/（在 Debian 系统上）中： 为您要将密钥部署到的客户端定义 pillar 键 custom_gpgkeys 并列出密钥文件名。 cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg 此外，在 Salt 文件系统中创建名为 gpg 的目录，并将 custom_gpgkeys pillar 数据中所指定的 GPG 密钥文件存储在该目录下。 ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 密钥将部署到客户端的 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 和 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 中。 最后一步是将 URL 添加到软件通道的“GPG 密钥

已同步的储存库去除了某个软件包。默认情况下，Uyuni 会将该软件包与相应通道解除关联，但不会去除该软件包。 储存库使用新版本取代了某个软件包，因而去除了之前的版本。 储存库同步流程被中断（例如，由于发生空间用尽异常），因此下载的软件包与任何通道都不关联。 用户手动上载了软件包，但未将其与任何通道关联。 孤立的软件包会消耗用户环境中的空间，并且无法轻松分发给客户端，因为它们与任何通道均不关联。孤立的软件包可能对特定的工作负载（例如引导或特定于客户的过程）有用。 您可以在 Web UI 中单击软件 管理 软件包 查看不属于任何通道的软件包，来查看孤立的软件包。 Uyuni 会定期运行 taskomatic 作业，以搜索孤立的软件包并将此类软件包的组织 ID 修改为 1。这意味着只有在

This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI.

Procedure: Configure a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on Your Client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.MLM.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.MLM.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare Software Channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Automated update of clients is benefitial when: update of a large number of clients is wanted the workflow should not be re-done every execution a dedicated maintenance window exists. Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent and supportable state. Before you start, you should have a number of clients onboarded. It may make sense to have them sorted into groups you want to update together. In this workflow we use a system group named infra-services. To update a client two steps are required. A third step is optional but highly recommended to finalize the update process. Procedure 1: Creating a Recurring Action to Update Salt Itself As an example, we create the action to update Salt itself as a recurring action for all systems in the organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like update-salt. Select a schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:00 am . Assign the update-salt state by selecting the checkbox. Click Save Changes to save the action. You can edit the execution order of the states if needed. Click Confirm to confirm the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 2: Creating a Recurring Action to Apply All Available Updates to the Systems As an example we create the action to apply all updates as a recurring action for a system group called infra-services. In the Uyuni Web UI go to Systems System Groups and click on infra-services. Now go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like full-system-update. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:30 am . Keep enough time between this action and the update-salt action. The update-salt actions must be finished on all systems before this action should be executed. Assign the states util.syncall, certs, channels and uptodate by selecting the checkboxes. To perform a reboot afterwards you can also add reboot or rebootifneeded. Save the action by clicking Save Changes. You can edit the execution order of the states. The order should be util.syncall, certs, channels, uptodate and finally reboot or rebootifneeded if chosen. Click Confirm to store the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 4: Creating a Recurring Action to Run a Highstate After the Update As an example, we create the action to apply the highstate for the same group which was fully updated before. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click infra-services. Go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Highstate and enter a Schedule Name like highstate. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 10:30 am . Again, keep enough time between this action and the full-system-update action. Click Create Schedule to save the action. The uptodate state applies critical patches to the update components. On SUSE-based systems, the state executes the command: zypper --non-interactive patch --updatestack-only And then, the state also updates Salt. On all the other systems, not based on SUSE, the state only updates Salt. The state runs the package manager, such as dnf, yum, apt, or zypper based on what is available on the client operating system to update the rest of the packages. The state lists all of the upgradable packages, based on the synchronized package repositories in Uyuni. The state upgrades the packages to their latest available version by using the client’s package manager. The executed command depends on the operating system of the client: For Debian-based clients, such as Debian or Ubuntu, the action executes apt dist-upgrade -q -y $PACKAGES. For RPM-based clients that are not SUSE, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Liberty Linux, the action executes yum --quiet -y update $PACKAGES or dnf --quiet -y upgrade $PACKAGES (depending on the package manager the client is using). For non-transactional SUSE clients, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, the action executes zypper --non-interactive --auto-agree-with-licenses update $PACKAGES. For transactional SUSE clients, the action executes the same in a transactional shell. Uyuni provides the reboot and rebootifneeded actions. Use one of the actions if you want your client to reboot after the package upgrade. + rebootifneeded Reboot detection is specific to the client operating system. For Debian or Ubuntu, see https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#signaling-that-a-reboot-is-required. For non-transactional SUSE clients, Uyuni reboots the client when zypper -x list-patches indicates that the patches require a reboot. For transactional SUSE clients, Uyuni reboots the client if there is a pending transaction. For the Red Hat-based clients, Uyuni reboots the client if dnf -q needs-restarting -r indicates that a reboot is required. + For more information, see the reboot_info.py module: https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/blob/master/susemanager-utils/susemanager-sls/src/modules/reboot_info.py For more information about recurring actions, see Recurring Actions.

CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle.

In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade <listentry> <ask_on_error config:type=\"boolean\">true</ask_on_error> #if $channel_prefix != \"\" <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #else <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #end if <name>$channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool</name> <product>sle-manager-tools</product> </listentry> Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration. Procedure: Migrating Clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. + image::wf-inplaceMigration-06.png[scaledwidth=80%] + image::wf-inplaceMigration-07.png[scaledwidth=80%] Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress.

Channels previously named SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ (with labels such as manager-tools-*), used in SUSE Manager 4.3 or 5.0, are no longer available in version 5.1. Although these old channels remain assigned to existing clients after migration, their corresponding repositories have been removed. To ensure continued updates for client tools, you must: Mirror the new SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels for the relevant products and assign them to the appropriate clients. Update any CLM projects, activation keys, or AutoYaST profiles that reference the old client tools channels to use the new ones. This workflow demonstrates how to automate the synchronization of the new client tools channels and switch existing entities to use them via the XML-RPC API. The process involves two main steps: Synchronize the new client tools channels. Update entities such as activation keys and CLM projects to use the new channels. This workflow is intended for administrators managing Uyuni 5.1. It helps automate the process of syncing new channels and updating activation keys and CLM projects, including project promotion, through the API, eliminating the need for manual operations in the Web UI. By following this workflow, you can create a Python script that: Synchronizes the new client tools channels. Lists all available activations keys/ CLM projects. Removes old client tools channels and attaches the new ones. Builds and promotes project environments. After completing this workflow, new client tools will be synced and activation key and CLM projects will be fully switched to the new client tools channels. Before you start, ensure that: You have administrator access to Uyuni. A working Python environment is available. This workflow is divided into two major steps: Synchronizing the new client tools channels. Updating CLM projects and activation keys to use these new channels. The first step ensures that all new client tools channels are synchronized for already installed base products. This is achieved by listing all installed products via the XML-RPC API and identifying the matching client tools extensions. The synchronization logic consists of two main operations: List all installed products and their associated extensions. Add the client tools channels (SLE-M-T family) that are not yet synchronized. These operations use the following XML-RPC methods: sync.content.listProducts(key) - Returns a list of all available products and their extensions. sync.content.addChannel(key, channelLabel, '') - adds a specific channel for synchronization. def find_extensions_of_synced_products(client, key): \"\"\"Retrieve all extensions of installed products.\"\"\" all_extensions = [] products = client.sync.content.listProducts(key) for product in products: if product.get('status', '').lower() == 'installed': extensions = product.get('extensions', []) all_extensions.extend(extensions) return all_extensions def add_client_tools_channels(client, key, extensions, dry_run): \"\"\"Add all new client tools channels that are not yet synced.\"\"\" for ext in extensions: if \"Client Tools\" in ext.get('friendly_name', ''): for ch in ext.get('channels', []): if ch.get('family') == 'SLE-M-T' and not ch.get('optional', False): if ch.get('status', '').lower() == 'installed': continue label = ch.get('label') client.sync.content.addChannel(key, label, '') Detect installed products using client.sync.content.listProducts(key). Iterate through product extensions to locate those containing “Client Tools” in their friendly_name. For each client tools extension: Check if the channel’s family equals SLE-M-T. Skip if the channel is already installed (status = installed). Otherwise, add the channel using client.sync.content.addChannel(key, label, ''). This will ensure that all required client tools channels are added automatically before updating CLM projects or activation keys in Step 2. Once the channels have been added, they will be picked up by the next scheduled repository synchronization job. If you want to trigger an immediate synchronization, you can schedule the Single Run Schedule task from the mgr-sync-refresh-bunch task family. This forces the server to refresh and synchronize all newly added channels right away. Based on this workflow, a helper utility script named sync_client_tools has been created in the Uyuni contrib repository that one can use. Once the new client tools channels are synchronized, the next step is to update your Content Lifecycle Management projects and activation keys so that they reference the new channels instead of the old ones. This ensures that clients continue receiving updates from the correct repositories. This step consists of the following main tasks: Identify CLM projects that still reference the old client tools channels. Detach old (manager-tools) channels and attach the new (managertools) channels. Rebuild and promote the CLM project environments in the correct order. Update related activation keys to reference the new channels. List all projects and select the one to process. For initial testing, use a single project such as clm-project-example: projects = client.contentmanagement.listProjects(key) for p in projects: if p['label'] == 'clm-project-example': # Adjust to process all projects if needed project_label = p['label'] Testing with a single project helps prevent large-scale accidental updates. Retrieve project sources and identify both old (manager-tools) and new (managertools) client tools channels: sources = client.contentmanagement.listProjectSources(key, project_label) old_tools = [s['channelLabel'] for s in sources if 'manager-tools' in s.get('channelLabel', '').lower()] new_tools = [s['channelLabel'] for s in sources if 'managertools' in s.get('channelLabel', '').lower()] These lists will be used to detach outdated channels and attach the new ones. For each old channel detected, call the detachSource endpoint: if old_tools: for old in old_tools: client.contentmanagement.detachSource(key, project_label, 'software', old) It is strongly recommended to run in dry-run mode first to validate which channels would be removed. If the new client tools channels are not already attached, identify the matching base channel, list its child channels, and attach those with managertools in the label : if not new_tools: source_labels = [s.get('channelLabel', '') for s in sources] base_channel_label = next((lbl for lbl in source_labels if lbl in base_channels), None) if base_channel_label: children = client.channel.software.listChildren(key, base_channel_label) managertools_labels = [s['label'] for s in children if 'managertools' in s.get('label', '').lower()] if managertools_labels: for label in managertools_labels: client.contentmanagement.attachSource(key, project_label, 'software', label) Ensure the new client tools channels are already mirrored and synchronized before attachment. Once sources are updated, list the project environments in sequence: all_envs = client.contentmanagement.listProjectEnvironments(key, project_label) The returned list is ordered, and promotions should follow that order. Build the first environment, then promote subsequent ones with short pauses between each to ensure completion. if not all_envs: return first_env_label = all_envs[0]['label'] for i, env in enumerate(all_envs): env_label = env['label'] is_first_env = (env_label == first_env_label) if is_first_env: description = \"Build for new client tools channels.\" client.contentmanagement.buildProject(key, project_label, description) else: client.contentmanagement.promoteProject(key, project_label, env_label) if not dry_run and i < len(all_envs) - 1: log(\"Waiting 30 seconds before next promotion...\") time.sleep(30) After CLM projects are updated, ensure that any activation keys referencing old client tools channels are switched to the new channels as well. You can use the following API calls activationkey.listActivationKeys(key) activationkey.removeChildChannels(key, key_label, channels) activationkey.addChildChannels(key, key_label, channels) to automate this process. Based on this workflow, a helper utility script named migrate_to_new_client_tools has been created in the Uyuni contrib repository to simplify and automate the migration process. It can significantly reduce manual effort, but it should be used with caution. Always test the script in dry-run mode and on a single entity first (for example, one CLM project or one activation key) before running it across all projects. The provided script example based on this workflow use some helper functions, mainly the following: log(message) – Prints or logs messages during execution. dry_run_log(message) – Logs intended actions when running in dry-run mode, without performing real API calls. wait_for_completion(client, key, project_label, env_label) – Waits for build or promotion tasks to complete, ensuring that the process finishes successfully before proceeding. These helper functions are not part of the XML-RPC API but are necessary for structured output, error handling, and safe automation. Without them, the script would execute API calls without clear feedback or control flow, which could lead to incomplete or unsafe project promotions. It is recommend to run your script in dry-run mode first to review the planned changes and test with a single project before applying it to all.","title":"Switch to new client tools channels","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-switch-to-new-client-tools-channels","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-switch-to-new-client-tools-channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The goal of this connection is to extract authentication data so the Uyuni Server can connect to a cloud RMT host. Then the Uyuni Server has access to products on the RMT host that are not already available with the SCC organization credentials. Before using PAYG feature make sure that: PAYG 实例是从正确的 SUSE 产品映像（例如 SLES、SLES for SAP、SLE HPC）启动的，以便能够访问所需储存库 Uyuni 服务器可以直接或通过堡垒连接到 PAYG 实例（最好位于同一区域） A basic SCC account is required.

If you bootstrap the PAYG instance to SUSE Manager, SUSE Manager will disable its PAYG repositories then add repositories from where it mirrored the data from the RMT server. The final result will be PAYG instances acquiring the same repositories from the RMT servers but through the SUSE Manager server itself. Of course repositories can still be setup primarily from SCC.

In the following, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server as the installed host operating system is explicitly mentioned only if it matters. Otherwise we either write SL Micro or just host operating system. The container host with SL Micro as operating system requires as free disk space: 至少 100 GB 用于基础安装 再加上至少 130 GB 用于储存库数据 Depending on the amount of selected software, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server as operating system can require considerably more disk space. 默认情况下，Uyuni 服务器容器会将镜像储存库（软件包或产品）、数据库和其他数据存储在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/ 目录的子目录中。如果此目录耗尽了磁盘空间，储存库同步将会失败。请根据您要镜像的客户端和储存库的数量和类型来估算 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/ 目录所需的空间。 有关文件系统和分区细节的详细信息，请参见 永久性存储和权限 和本指南的安装和部署相关章节中的详细安装说明。 Table 1. 服务器硬件要求 Hardware Details Recommendation CPU x86-64, ARM, ppc64le or s390x Minimum 4 dedicated 64-bit CPU cores RAM Minimum 16 GB Recommended 32 GB Disk Space / (root directory) 40 GB /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Minimum 150 GB (depending on the number of products) /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql Minimum 50 GB Swap space Systems can benefit from additional swap space. SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For more information about swap space, see Swap space. 8 to 12 GB The images by default have a 40 GB / partition. The cloud image of SL Micro 6.1 has just a 5 GB / partition. Both work flawlessly with Uyuni. As long as external storage is mounted to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes, Uyuni does not need or use storage on the / partition, but leaves that to the management of the container host itself. Uyuni 性能取决于硬件资源、网络带宽、客户端与服务器之间的延迟，等等。 根据所用体验和部署方式的不同，Uyuni 服务器与足够数量的代理配套使用时，建议每个服务器处理的客户端不要超过 10,000 个，以便获得最佳性能。当客户端数量超过 10,000 个时，强烈建议改为使用集线器设置并咨询相关专业人员。即使优化了设置并配备了充足的代理，数量如此庞大的客户端也可能导致发生性能问题。 有关如何管理大量客户端的详细信息，请参见 Multiple Servers with Hub to Manage Large Scale Deployments。 One of SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 is the operating system of the container host. Minimum requirements are suitable for a quick test installation, such as a Proxy with one client. If you want to use a production environment start with recommended values.

SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For more information about swap space, see Swap space. 4 to 8 GB 默认情况下，Uyuni 代理容器将软件包缓存在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ 目录中。如果可用空间不足，代理将去除旧的未使用软件包，并将其替换为较新的软件包。 鉴于这种行为： 代理上的 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ 目录越大，代理与 Uyuni 服务器之间的流量就越少。 使代理上的 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ 目录与 Uyuni 服务器上的 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/ 保持相同的大小，可以避免在首次同步后出现大量的流量。 Uyuni 服务器上的 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ 目录可能比代理上的目录要小。有关大小估算的指导，请参见服务器要求一节。 一般情况下，SUSE 建议将缓存目录的值调整为可用空间的 80 %。在服务器上生成代理配置时会设置 cache_dir 值。无法直接在 squid.conf 中设置该选项。 Workloads differ from system to system. Systems with heavy or unpredictable workloads can benefit from additional swap space, regardless of total RAM. It is recommended to place swap on the fastest available storage (for example, SSD). SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For size recommendations, see the tables above. The following shell command snippet creates a 8GiB swap file. A swap file on BtrFS filesystem prevent creating of a snapshot of that volume. /var in the following example is already excluded from the snapper snapshots, so it is safe to use /var/swap. ## setup swapfile at /var/swap # run following as a root user # allocate 8GiB for swap file fallocate -l 8G /var/swap # ensure CoW is disabled for the swap file chattr +C /var/swap # allow only root access chmod 600 /var/swap # make swap file based on allocated file mkswap /var/swap # activate swap use for the running system swapon /var/swap # activate swap during the next boots echo \"/var/swap swap swap defaults 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab PostgreSQL 是唯一受支持的数据库。不支持使用远程 PostgreSQL 数据库或装有 PostgreSQL 数据库的远程文件系统（例如 NFS）。换句话说，PostgreSQL 应该位于 Uyuni 可用的最快的存储设备上。 由于存在潜在性能问题，我们不建议从 Uyuni 远程运行 PostgreSQL 数据库。虽然这种环境在很多情况下是可行的甚至非常稳定，但如果发生问题，始终存在丢失数据的风险。 默认情况下，在部署容器时会创建永久性卷。 但建议您将卷存储在一个或多个单独的存储设备上。这种设置有助于避免生产环境中丢失数据。此操作可在部署容器后再进行。 最好在首次部署容器之后设置存储设备。有关更多细节，请参见 永久性容器卷。 我们建议使用 XFS 作为所有卷的文件系统类型。用于存储储存库的磁盘大小取决于您要使用 Uyuni 管理的发行套件和通道数目。请参见本节中的表格来估算所需大小。 Do not use NFS for Cobbler or PostgreSQL storage, neither NFS on SELinux environments. These scenarios are not supported. 在 Uyuni 服务器上，使用以下命令找到所有可用的存储设备： hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"Device File:\" 使用 lsblk 命令查看每个设备的名称和大小。 使用 mgr-storage-server 命令并加上设备名，可将外部磁盘设置为数据存储位置，您还可以选择指定服务器自身的磁盘用于数据库： mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] 例如： mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 外部存储卷将设置为挂载到 /manager_storage 和 /pgsql_storage 的 XFS 分区。 此命令将在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes 中创建永久性存储卷。 有关详细信息，请参见 Persistent Container Volumes。 可对通道数据和数据库使用同一个存储设备。但不建议这样做，因为不断增长的通道储存库可能会填满存储，从而给数据库完整性带来风险。使用独立的存储设备还可以提高性能。如果您想要使用单个存储设备，请结合单个设备名参数运行 mgr-storage-server。 如果您安装的是代理，mgr-storage-proxy 命令只接受单个设备名参数，并将外部存储位置设置为 Squid 缓存。 对于所有类型的虚拟机 (VM)，通常都不需要 LVM，也不建议使用。磁盘设置是虚拟的，因此卷可以使用单独的磁盘，这也是建议的做法。 对于其他部署，也建议为卷使用单独的磁盘。 On the container host of the Uyuni Server, the mgr-storage-server command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. Optionally, if a second device name is specified, mgr-storage-server moves the content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql database directory to a second separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql. Similarly, on the container host of the Uyuni Proxy, the mgr-storage-proxy command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes.","title":"硬件要求","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 服务器要求","hash":"server-hardware-requirements","id":1},{"text":"2. 代理要求","hash":"proxy-hardware-requirements","id":2},{"text":"3.

For example, set: [Service] Environment=TZ=Europe/Berlin Environment=\"PODMAN_EXTRA_ARGS=\" Environment=\"https_proxy=user:password@http://192.168.10.1:3128\" For Java application internet access, modify /etc/rhn/rhn.conf according to your needs. On the container host, execute mgrctl term to open a command line inside the server container: Modify /etc/rhn/rhn.conf according to your needs. For example, set: # Use proxy FQDN, or FQDN:port server.satellite.http_proxy = server.satellite.http_proxy_username = server.satellite.http_proxy_password = # no_proxy is a comma seperated list server.satellite.no_proxy = On the container host, restart the server to enforce the new configuration: systemctl restart uyuni-server.service If you are on an internal network and do not have access to SUSE Customer Center, you can use an Air-gapped Deployment. 在生产环境中，Uyuni 服务器和客户端始终应使用防火墙。有关所需端口的完整列表，请参见 所需的网络端口。 本节提供了 Uyuni 中各种通讯使用的端口的综合列表。 您不需要打开所有这些端口。某些端口只有在您使用需要这些端口的服务时才需打开。 必须打开外部入站端口，以在 Uyuni 服务器上配置防火墙用于防范未经授权访问服务器。 打开这些端口将允许外部网络流量访问 Uyuni 服务器。 Table 1.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License.

Preface","hash":"_preface","id":1}]},"193":{"id":193,"text":"To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configures DHCP for PXE booting. Without the formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. For more information how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server, see DHCPd Formula. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using the newest Uyuni Server. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. 过程 Create the following three system groups. For guidelines on how to create the groups, see 系统组. TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 The first group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. The second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. The third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. This converts the branch group to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name and Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot Group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy, fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. For explanation of possible configurations, see Terminal Names. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server, where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is built and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Procedure: Deploying with containerized workflow Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Procedure: Deploying with non-ontainerized workflow Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example, when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with which parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In this example we consider architecture with dedicated network for POS terminals where branch server provides all required services including DHCP and DNS. For dedicated network we assume 192.168.86.0/24 network. In this example we provide Salt and ftp CNAMEs for Saltboot service discovery. We assume to have one regular branch server with Salt minion id branch1.mystore.com, which is equal to the branch server fully qualified domain name, and branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. This example covers two configuration methods. Both of the methods achieve the same result.

The hardware type group (i.e. HWTYPE group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the Saltboot formula. This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. Procedure: Dual group image deployment Build new image. Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Controlling image versions","hash":"_controlling_image_versions","id":2}]},"199":{"id":199,"text":"Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see 映像构建和管理. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see 使用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 进行监控. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The Saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the Saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the Saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the Saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be <NAME>-<VERSION> and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar in the database. Performance tuning is possible with the -B <VALUE> option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see [retail.deployterminals.auto.once]. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, which is preserved in etc-salt volume. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept 在 Uyuni 容器主机的命令提示符处，以 root 身份进入服务器容器： mgrctl term 在容器内部，执行以下步骤： In directory /etc/salt/master.d/, create file autosign_grains.conf and specify autosign_grains_dir: echo \"autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains\" \\ > /etc/salt/master.d/autosign_grains.conf Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot (replace <AUTOSIGN_KEY> with the key: mkdir /etc/salt/autosign_grains echo \"<AUTOSIGN_KEY>\" > /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key For multiple keys, put each one on a new line. For more information about configuring the server to automatically accept grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/autoaccept_grains.html. Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY> # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details.

You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create <usb image name> <size in MB> Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if=<usb image name> of=<path to usb device> When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. 构建映像。 Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> .

You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt <terminal_salt_name> state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Terminals can be either x86-64 or arm64 architecture. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see 映像构建和管理. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Manual synchronization of images is needed only when using non-containerized Uyuni for Retail 4.3 branch server. Image synchronization downloads system and boot images from the Uyuni Server to the Uyuni for Retail branch server. This may involve updating default boot image for not yet registered terminals. Default boot image can be set in the Image Synchronize formula. If default boot image is not set, boot image with highest version is used as default boot image. This behaviour can be disabled by unchecking Use Latest Boot Image checkbox in the Image Synchronize formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_salt_id> state.apply image-sync When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. Create the top.sls file with content: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Create the saltboot_proto.sls file with content: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp saltboot_proto.sls server:/srv/pillar/ Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. Create the top.sls file with content: base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Create the $branch_prefix.sls file with content: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp $branch_prefix.sls server:/srv/pillar/","title":"Deployment basics","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You can use the Uyuni Web UI to apply common Uyuni formulas. For the most commonly used formulas, see Salt Formulas. All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server. The following formulas can be used for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3 with Uyuni 5.0: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula In addition, Bind and DHCPd formulas can be used, but not on the branch server because SLE Micro does not have Bind and DHCPd in the repositories. Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services. Use the Saltboot formula to specify disk partitioning, and to select which image should be deployed.

You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see 映像构建和管理. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 有关系统组的详细信息，请参见 系统组。 During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see 使用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 进行监控. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible 集成. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"<FQDN of branch server proxy>/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_minion_id> state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly.

Mass configuration tool was not yet adapted for containerized saltboot workflow. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services. It also contains one or more build hosts. The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see 容器化 Uyuni Proxy 设置. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements. The branch server and the terminals are connected to the same network as the Uyuni Server. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network. The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage. In this configuration, external routers provide DHCP and DNS services to the branch servers and the terminals, and the branch server provides proxy, PXE, HTTP and TFTP services to the terminals in their branch network.

This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded. When the terminal is rebooted and an uptodate POS image is found in the service partition, the terminal will automatically use this cached image for system redeployment.","title":"Offline Use","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-offline","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-offline.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Occasionally, however, it is needed to force Saltboot to redeploy an image or repartition disk, even when automation would not do so. For these situations, Saltboot offers three ways to force redeployment or repartitioning: Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Repartitioning of a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions. Saltboot redeployment grains have no side effects, and do not require any further configuration. The limitation is that terminal must be accessible by salt. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Procedure: Forcing a Saltboot to repartition the hard disk On the Uyuni Server, as root, apply this Salt state at the command prompt: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_repartition Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. Saltboot custom values remove the limitation on terminal being reachable by salt, however there are configuration steps. Custom info keys and values can be also managed using API or spacecmd command.

After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. An API call system.setPillar can be used to set specific Saltboot options through Salt pillar data. Uyuni Saltboot integration is using tuning-saltboot pillar category to manage Saltboot tuning, including forced redeployment or disk repartition. Using this pillar category allows Uyuni to reset Saltboot flag once the terminal is booted up. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image using API call using spacecmd command In the console run following the command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_redeployment\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to repartition disk using API call using spacecmd command In the console run the following command, replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_repartition\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Check Saltboot tuning options In the console run the following command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot' system.getPillar Make sure to use tuning-saltboot as pillar category in the API call.

Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, HWType, and MAC. Naming scheme and its configuration can be selected in the Saltboot Group formula for containerized branch servers or in the Branch Network formula for others. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy and Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID 例如： B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID 例如： B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 例如： B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. Terminal names are derived from the network interface hardware address (MAC) and use this format: BranchID.MAC-UniqueID 例如： B0002.52:54:00:62:18:6f-cb83 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The MAC is colon delimited hardware address of the network interface card used for booting of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the non-containerized branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet <terminal_MAC_address> OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: <IP_Address> hwAddress: <MAC_Address> hwtype: <HWTYPE_Group_name_without_HWTYPE:_prefix> Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration.

Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. 此过程所需的产品包括： Table 1. openSUSE 通道 - CLI OS Version openSUSE Leap 15.4 Base Channel opensuse_leap15_4 Client Channel opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-updates Non-OSS Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss Non-OSS Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates Backports Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates SLE Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates 过程：在命令提示符下添加软件频道 With the spacewalk-common-channels command you can add the appropriate channels. At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, execute the following command: mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-common-channels \\ <base_channel_name> \\ <child_channel_name_1> \\ <child_channel_name_2> \\ ... <child_channel_name_n> Synchronize the channels: mgrctl exec -- mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels 过程：检查同步进度 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，导航到软件 管理 通道，然后单击与储存库关联的通道。 导航到储存库选项卡，然后单击同步并选中同步状态。 过程：在命令提示符处检查同步进度 在 Uyuni 服务器上的命令提示符处，以 root 身份使用 tail 命令检查同步日志文件： tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE 通道可能会非常大。同步所需的时间可能会长达数小时。 By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. 过程：在客户端上信任 GPG 密钥 On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key If you are bootstrapping clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) 有关创建激活密钥的详细信息，请参见 激活密钥。 You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels 有关注册客户端的详细信息，请参见 客户端注册。 A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see 容器化 Uyuni Proxy 设置. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types. Configure the proxy to become a branch server. On the Uyuni for Retail Server, for example, run: retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id> --dedicated-nic eth1 \\ --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \\ --netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \\ --server-domain branch.example.org \\ --branch-prefix uyuni For additional options, use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.","title":"Retail Uyuni Branch Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-uyuni-branchserver","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-uyuni-branchserver.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 添加软件通道","hash":"_添加软件通道","id":1},{"text":"2. 检查同步状态","hash":"_检查同步状态","id":2},{"text":"3. 在客户端上信任 GPG 密钥","hash":"_在客户端上信任_gpg_密钥","id":3},{"text":"4.

This command updates the settings in the PostgreSQL database and the internal structures of Uyuni. The command takes no mandatory parameter, but can take the new hostname if it is not the one from the container host. In case any SSL certificate needs to be generated to match the new hostname, the SSL CA password needs to be provided.

They are designed to configure storage for Uyuni Server and Proxy. The scripts take disk devices as arguments. mgr-storage-proxy requires a single argument for the storage disk device. mgr-storage-server requires a storage disk device and can optionally accept a second argument for a dedicated database disk device. While both normal and database storage can reside on the same disk, it is advisable to place the database on a dedicated, high-performance disk to ensure better performance and easier management. Both mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy perform standard storage setup operations: Validate the provided storage devices. Ensure that devices are empty and suitable for use. Create XFS filesystems on the specified devices. Mount the devices temporarily for data migration. Move the relevant storage directories to the new devices. Create entries in /etc/fstab so that the storage mounts automatically on boot. Remount the devices at their final locations. Table 1. Additional tool-specific behavior mgr-storage-server Optionally supports a separate device for database storage. Stops SUSE Manager services during migration, restarts them afterward. Moves Podman volumes directory /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes to the prepared storage, and optionally /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql to the prepared database storage. mgr-storage-proxy Focuses only on proxy storage (no database storage support). Stops and restarts the proxy service during migration. Moves podman volumes directory /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes to the prepared storage. Both tools automate standard Linux storage operations. There is no hidden or custom logic beyond what a Linux administrator would do manually. They do not create or manage LVM volumes. They do not configure RAID or complex storage topologies. They do not prevent you from managing storage using normal Linux tools after setup. They do not provide dynamic resizing or expansion capabilities — these must be handled using standard Linux storage tools. Once storage has been configured, you can safely manage it using standard Linux commands. Listing 1. Example 1: Extending storage if using LVM lvextend -L +10G /dev/your_vg/your_lv xfs_growfs /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Example 2: Migrating to a larger disk Add and format the new disk. Mount it temporarily. Use rsync to copy data. Update /etc/fstab. Remount at the correct location. Always take a backup before making changes to your storage setup. Use these tools only during initial storage setup or when migrating to new storage where the tool is expected to handle data migration and update /etc/fstab. Do not rerun these scripts for resizing or expanding storage. Use standard Linux tools (e.g., lvextend, xfs_growfs) for such operations. mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy help automate the initial persistent storage setup for Uyuni components using standard Linux storage practices. They do not limit or interfere with standard storage management afterward. After setup, continue managing your storage using familiar Linux tools. A full database volume can cause significant issues with system operation. As disk usage notifications have not yet been adapted for containerized environments, users are encouraged to monitor the disk space used by Podman volumes themselves, either through tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, or any other preferred method. Pay particular attention to the var-pgsql volume, located under /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/.","title":"Understanding mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"storage-scripts","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-management/storage-scripts.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help <topic>): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy is generally reasonable for 500-1000 clients, but this is a recommendation, not a hard limit, and depends on available network bandwidth Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"424":{"id":424,"text":"When XMLRPC API is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"<HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL>\" HUB_USERNAME = \"<USERNAME>\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"<PASSWORD>\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server.

However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/MLM. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"429":{"id":429,"text":"Hub online synchronization reuses the existing repository synchronization and synchronizes channels in the peripheral servers from the repositories on the hub server. When the connection between hub and peripheral server is established, the hub server becomes the main source of data for the peripheral server. In case of vendor channels, hub server is effectively replacing SUSE Customer Center. In case of custom channels, when they are synchronized, the peripheral server will fetch the packages from the hub and not from the original location of the custom channel defined on the hub. The main characteristics of this feature are: There can only be one hub server per connection, with one or more peripheral servers. Each peripheral server can only have one hub server. Content can be synchronized on regular basis, or on demand. Hub online synchronization is configured from menu Admin Hub Configuration. Configuration process uses token which uniquely identifies peripheral server’s connection to the hub. There are two ways to register a peripheral server to the hub server: by using a combination of token creation on the peripheral, and subsequent registration on the hub server. This method uses Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server and Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token. by direct registration from the hub, without any user interactions with the peripheral server. This method is described in Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server. In any case, if the peripheral host should be managed by the hub, you must first bootstrap the host as a minion to the hub before proceeding with the registration of the peripheral server. If the bootstrapping happens later, two systems are shown in the systems list. Before being registered to the hub server, a token needs to be generated on the peripheral server and passed to the administrator of the hub server. Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server On the peripheral server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Access Tokens. Click button Add token and select option Issue new token. In the field Server FQDN on the form that opens type the FQDN of the hub server that will be using this token. Click Issue. A new form with the successfully generated token appears and button Copy. The only time token is displayed is at the time of its creation. Save it in a safe place until it is later needed. Once generated, the token appears on the screen Access Tokens. The generated token needs to be transferred to the hub server before it can be used. Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token On the hub server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Existing token. In the field Token paste the token that was created on the peripheral server. In the field Root CA certificate specify the certificate using one of the options: Use option Not needed if both hub and peripheral servers have the same certificate authority. Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate to paste a certificate. Click button Register. A newly registered peripheral server will appear on screen Peripherals Configuration. It is possible to initiate the registration of a peripheral server from hub server, without any interaction with the peripheral server. Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server On the hub server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Administrator User/Password. In the fields Username and Password enter the credentials for the peripheral server. The credentials must be those of SUSE Manager Administrator of the peripheral server. In the field Root CA certificate specify the certificate using one of the options: Use option Not needed if both hub and peripheral servers have the same certificate authority. Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate in cases when PEM certificate is used. Click button Register. The newly registered peripheral server will be shown in the Systems System List with the value Foreign in the column System Type. To access its details, click on the peripheral server’s name and select tab Details Peripheral Server. Peripheral server uses hub to access the vendor channels and does not connect to the SUSE Customer Center directly. Therefore, if you open configured peripheral server’s page Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials, Admin Setup Wizard Products or Admin Setup Wizard PAYG Connections, you will see a notification that this is peripheral server and its connections are managed via hub. All existing tokens are shown in Admin Hub Configuration Access Tokens. A token can viewed as Consumed and Issued, both from the perspective of the peripheral and the hub server. From the perspective of the peripheral server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the peripheral server and received by the hub server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the hub server to be used by the peripheral server. From the perspective of the hub server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the hub server and received by the peripheral server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the peripheral server to be used by the hub server. A token can be invalidated, or deleted. Be careful when using option Invalidate as it no longer grants access to the other server. This operation ensures that no communication will happen until a new token is generated if the existing one is compromised, or until the current token is reactivated. Invalidated token can be made valid again at any time. It is possible to delete a token. Deleting is only possible when the server associated with the token is not registered as hub or peripheral. This operation cannot be undone. Every peripheral server stores the information about its hub server. A peripheral server can only have one hub server configured. Procedure: Accessing hub server details On the peripheral server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Hub Details. On the screen Hub Details find the information about the hub server. Field Hub server FQDN shows the hub server’s FQDN. Field Registration date shows the time when the peripheral server was registered to the hub server. Field Last modified shows the time of the last saved configuration change. Field Root Certificate Authority shows certificate details. To download, edit or delete the root certificate, clicking Download, Edit or Delete respectively. Deleting the certificate will break the connection between servers. Field GPG Public Key shows whether the GPG key has been configured for the hub server. For more information about GPG keys between hub and peripheral servers, see GPG key usage with hub online synchronization. Field Mirror credentials is the username the peripheral server uses when connecting to the hub server to synchronize vendor channels. This username is generated automatically on the hub server, and then transmitted to the peripheral server during the registration phase. When the metadata on the hub server are signed with a GPG key, the public key is automatically transmitted from hub to peripheral server. By default, Uyuni is not signing metadata. Therefore, when the peripheral server is downloading data from the hub server there is no way of checking if the downloaded metadata have a valid signature, unless the customer has created their own GPG key. To enable checking of the data integrity, the GPG key needs to be created on the hub. When the peripheral server is configured to communicate with the hub, the public GPG key will then automatically be transferred to it. When the GPG key is created on the hub, field GPG Public Key will be set to show that this server is using the GPG key. For more information about setting up own GPG key, see 储存库元数据.

For more information about certificates, see Hub deployment with XMLRPC. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Navigate to Help Report Database Schema to find the schema documentation. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Monitor memory and cpu usage of the hub closely before and after the change. Also monitor the load, cpu and memory usage of the reporting database of the hub. Notes All the data collected from the peripheral server must be written into the hub reporting database. Tuning that database could increase the performance as well.","title":"Hub Reporting","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-reporting","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-reporting.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt Mine to check client availability. The Salt Mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. Since the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt Mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered clients will have the Salt Mine disabled by default. If the Salt Mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt Mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information, see 安装 Uyuni 代理.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Multi-Linux Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case.

More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation Depends on other settings, use /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/susemanager-connection-check to obtain a recommendation. Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Setting this value to very high values could cause opposite effect as the workers will compete to each other for the CPU resources and the performance could be dropped significantly. Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master could be a sign of too low or too high value of this parameter. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-32, depending on the number of the CPU cores available for the server, it is recommended to keep the value slightly less than the number of CPU cores. Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 16 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. It makes sense to monitor the salt-master stats event by enabling master_stats and adjusting master_stats_event_iter to fine tune the value of this parameter. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description Determines whether the master will fire authentication events. Authentication events are fired when a minion performs an authentication check with the master. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of salt/auth events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example auth_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#auth-events Description Determines whether the master will fire minion data cache events (minion/refresh/*). Minion data cache events are fired when a minion requests a minion data cache refresh. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of minion/refresh/* events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example minion_data_cache_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#minion-data-cache-events Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Description Determines whether the salt-broker service should wait for backend sockets to be connected before opening the sockets for listening for connections from salt-minions. When enabled, it helps to prevent collecting ZeroMQ messages with the internal buffers of the sockets and pushing them to the salt-master once connection is restored. Tune when Unstable connectivity between the Uyuni Proxy and the Uyuni Server. Value default False Value recommendation True Location /etc/salt/broker Example wait_for_backend: True More information Proxies Connectivity Description The tcp keepalive interval to set on TCP ports. This setting can be used to tune Salt connectivity issues in messy network environments with misbehaving firewalls. Tune when Unstable connectivity between managed clients and the Uyuni Proxy or the Uyuni Server. Value default True Value recommendation True Location /etc/venv-salt-minon/minion.d/tuning.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning.conf, depending on the minion type. Example tcp_keepalive: True After changing Check Minions Connectivity for more details to fine tune extra keepalive parameters. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/minion.html#tcp-keepalive, Minions Connectivity Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command supportconfig. The command-line tool is provided by the package supportutils which is installed by default. Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate supportconfig plug-ins. When supportconfig is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. supportconfig plug-ins are stored in directory /usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/. The following procedure shows how to create a supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly. Procedure: Creating a supportconfig Archive Run supportconfig as root.

Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP4/html/SLES-SAP-installation/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 一般要求. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see 激活密钥. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox.

There are no common recommendations for all the possible use cases as the environments could be very different expecially if public clouds instances are involved. In case clients are losing the connection to the Uyuni Server (or Uyuni Proxy if involved), they are unreachable from the Uyuni Server Web UI or with command line tools. To understand such a connection issue check if the client is not reachable from the Uyuni Server with salt MINION_ID test.ping, while venv-salt-call test.ping (or salt-call test.ping if non-bundle Salt is used on the client) is working fine on the client side. If this is the case, it is recommended to set tcp_keepalive parameters. The parameters with the values from the example below can be used as a starting point to look for settings, which could prevent cases of connection loss without restoring for some environments. It is recommended to put the parameters in the separate drop-in configuration file like /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf, depending on the minion type used on the client side. Listing 1. Example: Keepalive Parameters Example Values ###### Keepalive settings ###### ############################################ # ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by # the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through # a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is # the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion # without informing either party that their connection has been taken away. # Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening. # Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False) # or leave to the OS defaults (-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled. tcp_keepalive: True # How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300 # to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (-1) is typically 7200 seconds # on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time. tcp_keepalive_idle: 10 # How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default -1 # to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes. tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3 # How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default -1 to # use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see # /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl. tcp_keepalive_intvl: 10 salt-broker service is used on Uyuni Proxies to forward Salt traffic between the Uyuni Server and salt-minion service used on the client side. It is possible that salt-broker and all the clients behind it could be affected with the same issue as the clients directly connected to the Uyuni Server. The issue could be fixed with the same parameters as recommended for the minions, but specified in /etc/salt/broker on each Uyuni Proxy. Uyuni Proxy connectivity can also suffer when the connectivity to the Uyuni Server is lost for a quite long interval. In such a case Proxy connected clients started to retry the authentication to the salt-master service on the Uyuni Server. This situation could be potentially dangerous because it could lead to collecting large amount of ZeroMQ messages with authentication attemps in the interal buffer of ZeroMQ sockets used inside the salt-broker service. Then, on restoring the connection to the salt-master all of the pending messages will be pushed to it. It could lead to the issues on Uyuni Server side with salt-master service, because it could be impossible to serve all the cached requests in appropriate time or even to the complete denial of the service. To avoid such situation a set of tuning parameters is available. As the most important one, wait_for_backend should be set to True. This prevents opening the sockets for the clients behind the proxy while the connectivity to the salt-master service is not established. In this case the messages from the clients are not collected in the internal buffers. drop_after_retries is setting the number of retries before closing the sockets to drop the cached messages. The other parameters could help to fine tune the behavior for the environment. Setting timeouts, intervals and drop_after_retries to lower values are making salt-broker service more aggressive on detecting the connection loss to the salt-master, so that it puts the clients behind the proxy to the conditions closer as they are connected directly to the Uyuni Server. Increasing the values could provide some benefits in case if the network channel between the Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni Server is not stable enough, the message buffering can provide some flexibility while re-establishing the connection.

Custom states are stored as Salt state files on the Uyuni Server with a .sls extension. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create and edit custom Salt state files. You must create a state channel first, with an initial state named init.sls. The init.sls file is used to reference all other state files within the channel. The custom states that you create using the Web UI are stored on the Uyuni Server in the the /srv/susemanager/salt/<organization>/ directory. After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state. If you want to reference file templates in this configuration channel, ensure your file starts by specifying the source of the managed file, using this syntax: file.managed: - source: salt://<org_name>/<channel_name>/etc/<ID>/<filename> Example custom state files are given later in this section. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. Procedure: Adding Additional Files to a Custom State Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. . Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit <filename>.sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2.

Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all user public files must be saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey-<key_id> deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls.

When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch.

The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN.

In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution.

You can write your own custom formulas, and make them available to client systems in the Uyuni Web UI. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directory also contains an optional metadata.yml file with additional information about the formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt/<custom-formula-name>/ Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/ All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a <field name>: null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/MLM_minion.py The process is executed like this: The MLM_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (MLM_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Getting the statistics based on the events published in the Salt event bus can help to identify possible weak points and perform Salt internals profiling. Saline is a powerful tool designed to function as a Prometheus exporter, enabling the collection of metrics based on events from the Salt event bus. These metrics are derived from event data available on the Salt master, similar to what is accessible through the command: mgrctl exec -ti -- salt-run state.event Saline is distributed as a separate container image, server-saline, for use with Uyuni Server. All related commands and operations should be executed on the Uyuni Server container host system. In addition to its role as a Prometheus exporter, Saline also provides the saline-formula, which simplifies configuration of Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, enhancing monitoring and visualization capabilities. Deployment instructions depend on when the customer decides to enable Saline. Saline can be deployed during the initial installation or an upgrade of the Uyuni server, by using command: mgradm install podman --saline-replicas 1 If the Uyuni server is already installed, you can enable Saline support without running a full server upgrade with this command: mgradm scale uyuni-saline --replicas 1 If you want to upgrade and add Saline with one single command, use: mgradm upgrade podman && mgradm scale uyuni-saline --replicas 1 In all scenarios, the only possible values for --saline-replicas are 1 or 0. After finishing the deployment Uyuni-saline.service should be configured on the Uyuni Server host system. It is recommended to add master_stats: True and adjust the value of master_stats_event_iter: 60 if needed. Then restart salt-master to get the detailed statistics of internal Salt calls. This can be help with tuning large scale deployment installations. To configure Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, see Saline Formula.

This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.

SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: <USER> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://MLM-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the MLM-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost MLM-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to MLM-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:MLM-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to MLM-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file=<temporary_bootstrap_roster> minion state.apply certs,<bootstrap_state>` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time. The SSH key is used on salt-ssh managed systems. Additionally, it is used on Uyuni Proxies for the user mgrsshtunnel. Normal systems managed with the Salt default method are not affected and do not have this key configured. Procedure: Rotating SSH keys On the Uyuni Server, as user root, change to user salt: su -s /bin/bash - salt Create a new SSH key: ssh-keygen -N \"\" -t rsa -q -f /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id Copy the public key into the Salt filesystem to make it usable in a Salt state: cp /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id.pub /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ Change back to user root again: exit Rollout the new key to all systems that need it. Applying the util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key state will limit the changes to salt-ssh managed systems and proxies: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key Move the old key away and make the new key the standard key. Rename mgr_ssh_id key to disabled_mgr_ssh_id and new_mgr_ssh_id key to mgr_ssh_id in the SSH keystore of the user salt as well as in the Salt filesystem for the public keys: su -s /bin/bash - salt cd .ssh mv mgr_ssh_id disabled_mgr_ssh_id mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id mgr_ssh_id mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub cd /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub OPTIONAL: When containerized proxies exist, re-create the configuration to get the new SSH key into the proxy configuration. Restart the containers with the new configuration. It is also possible to change the existing configuration on the podman host (ssh.yaml). Change the value of server_ssh_key_pub with the content of the current mgr_ssh_id.pub. To remove the disabled keys from the authorized_keys` files of the [literal]salt-ssh`` managed systems and the proxies, apply the state a second time: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see 自定义系统信息. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. If you change pillar data on the server (Salt master) the actual pillar data on the client (minion) is updated only after calling saltutil.refresh_pillar for the client. Otherwise it could happen that pillar.items and pillar.get calls would produce different results with different values of pillars that were not refreshed. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring. When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor.

For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are sometimes referred to as Salt clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step. For more information on states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html. For more Salt terminology, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/glossary.html.","title":"Terminology","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-terminology","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-terminology.html","titles":[]},"475":{"id":475,"text":"Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A Salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (java.salt_presence_ping_timeout/java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here. Uyuni defines a timeout for SSH connections in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf: # salt_ssh_connect_timeout = 180","title":"Salt timeouts","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-timeouts","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-timeouts.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Multi-Linux Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp://<server-address>/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This section provides steps on registering your products after SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: SUSEConnect --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install. If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code. For example for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP7, use the following commands: SUSEConnect -r <regcode> SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.7/x86_64 SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with the following command: SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> Procedure: Installing podman Log in as root and install podman plus, on the server, mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion or, on the proxies, mgrpxy and mgrpxy-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): On the server: zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion On the proxies: zypper install podman mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service To continue with deployment, see 配置自定义永久性存储. Configuring persistent storage is optional, but it is the only way to avoid serious trouble with container full disk conditions. If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-proxy tool. 有关详细信息，请参见 mgr-storage-proxy --help。此工具可以简化容器存储和 Squid 缓存卷的创建。 如下所示使用命令： mgr-storage-proxy <存储磁盘设备> 例如： mgr-storage-proxy /dev/nvme1n1 此命令将在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes 中创建永久性存储卷。 有关详细信息，请参见 Persistent Container Volumes 对容器全盘空间用尽事件进行查错 过程：创建激活密钥 Navigate to Systems Activation Keys , and click Create key. Create an activation key for the proxy host with SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 as the parent channel. This key should include all recommended channels and the proxy as an extension child channel. 继续将代理主机作为 default 客户端进行引导。 过程：引导代理主机 选择系统 引导。 填写代理主机的相关字段。 从下拉列表中选择上一步骤中创建的激活密钥。 单击 引导。 等待引导过程成功完成。检查 Salt 菜单，确认 Salt 密钥已列出并已接受。 Reboot the proxy host if the operating system is SL Micro. Select the host from the System list and trigger a second reboot in case of SL Micro after all events are finished to conclude the onboarding. 过程：更新代理主机 从系统列表中选择主机，并应用所有补丁以将其更新。 Reboot the proxy host if the operating system is SL Micro. Uyuni 代理的配置存档由 Uyuni 服务器生成。每个附加代理都需要自身的配置存档。 For the containerized Uyuni Proxy, you must build a new proxy configuration file and then redeploy the container for the changes to take effect. This is the process for updating settings, including the SSL certificate. 对于 Podman 部署，在生成此代理配置之前，必须将 Uyuni 代理的容器主机作为客户端注册到 Uyuni 服务器。 如果使用代理 FQDN 生成非注册客户端的代理容器配置（如 Kubernetes 用例中那样），系统列表中将出现一个新的系统项。此新项将显示在之前输入的“代理 FQDN”值下方并属于外部系统类型。 Procedure: Generating a Proxy Container Configuration Using Web UI 在 Web UI 中，导航到系统 代理配置，然后填写所需数据： 在代理 FQDN字段中，键入代理的完全限定域名。 在父 FQDN字段中，键入 Uyuni 服务器或另一个 Uyuni 代理的完全限定域名。 在代理 SSH 端口字段中，键入 SSH 服务在 Uyuni 代理上监听的 SSH 端口。建议保留默认值 8022。 In the Max Squid cache size [MB] field type maximal allowed size for Squid cache. Recommended is to use at most 80% of available storage for the containers. 2 GB 表示默认的代理 squid 缓存大小。需要根据您的环境调整此大小。 在 SSH 证书选择列表中，选择应为 Uyuni 代理生成新服务器证书还是使用现有证书。您可以考虑作为 Uyuni 内置（自我签名）证书生成的证书。 然后根据所做的选择提供用于生成新证书的签名 CA 证书的路径，或者要用作代理证书的现有证书及其密钥的路径。 服务器生成的 CA 证书存储在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/root/_data/ssl-build 目录中。 有关现有或自定义证书的详细信息以及企业和中间证书的概念，请参见 导入 SSL 证书。 单击 生成 以在 Uyuni 服务器中注册新代理 FQDN，并生成包含容器主机细节的配置存档 (config.tar.gz)。 片刻之后，系统会显示文件可供下载。请将此文件保存在本地。 可以使用 spacecmd 生成代理配置。 过程：使用 spacecmd 和自我签名证书生成代理配置 通过 SSH 连接到您的容器主机。 执行以下命令（替换其中的服务器和代理 FQDN）： mgrctl exec -ti 'spacecmd proxy_container_config_generate_cert -- dev-pxy.example.com dev-srv.example.com 2048 email@example.com -o /tmp/config.tar.gz' 从服务器容器复制生成的配置： mgrctl cp server:/tmp/config.tar.gz You can generate a Proxy configuration using spacecmd for custom certificates rather than the default self-signed certificates. 过程：使用 spacecmd 和自定义证书生成代理配置 通过 SSH 连接到您的服务器容器主机。 Execute the following commands, replacing the Server and Proxy FQDN: for f in ca.crt proxy.crt proxy.key; do mgrctl cp $f server:/tmp/$f done mgrctl exec -ti 'spacecmd proxy_container_config -- -p 8022 pxy.example.com srv.example.com 2048 email@example.com /tmp/ca.crt /tmp/proxy.crt /tmp/proxy.key -o /tmp/config.tar.gz' If your setup uses an intermediate CA, copy it as well and include it in the command with the -i option (can be provided multiple times if needed) : mgrctl cp intermediateCA.pem server:/tmp/intermediateCA.pem mgrctl exec -ti 'spacecmd proxy_container_config -- -p 8022 -i /tmp/intermediateCA.pem pxy.example.com srv.example.com 2048 email@example.com /tmp/ca.crt /tmp/proxy.crt /tmp/proxy.key -o /tmp/config.tar.gz' 从服务器容器复制生成的配置： mgrctl cp server:/tmp/config.tar.gz Web UI 将生成配置存档。需要在代理容器主机上提供此存档。 过程：复制代理配置 从服务器容器将上一步生成的配置存档 (config.tar.gz) 复制到服务器主机（如果还未执行此操作）： mgrctl cp server:/root/config.tar.gz 将服务器主机中的文件复制到代理主机（如果还未执行此操作）： scp config.tar.gz <代理 FQDN>:/root 在代理主机上使用以下命令安装代理： mgrpxy install podman config.tar.gz 现在可以使用 mgrpxy 命令启动容器： 过程：启动代理并检查状态 调用以下命令启动代理： mgrpxy start 调用以下命令检查容器状态： mgrpxy status 应该会显示以下五个 Uyuni 代理容器，并且它们应该是 proxy-pod 容器 Pod 的一部分： proxy-salt-broker proxy-httpd proxy-tftpd proxy-squid proxy-ssh 默认情况下，Uyuni 代理套件配置为针对其每个服务使用相同的映像版本和注册表路径。但是，可以使用以 -tag 和 -image 结尾的 install 参数覆盖特定服务的默认值。 例如： mgrpxy install podman --httpd-tag 0.1.0 --httpd-image registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpd /path/to/config.tar.gz 该命令会在重启动 httpd 服务之前调整其配置文件。其中 registry.opensuse.org/uyuni/proxy-httpds 是要使用的映像，0.1.0 是版本标记。 要重置为默认值，请再次运行 install 命令但不要指定这些参数： mgrpxy install podman /path/to/config.tar.gz 此命令首先将所有服务的配置重置为全局默认值，然后重新装载配置。","title":"Uyuni 2025.10 Proxy Deployment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"proxy-deployment-mlm","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/proxy-deployment-mlm.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 代理的硬件要求","hash":"_代理的硬件要求","id":1},{"text":"2. 同步父通道和代理扩展子通道","hash":"_同步父通道和代理扩展子通道","id":2},{"text":"3.

If you added Uyuni 2025.10 as an extension during SL Micro 6.1 installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SL Micro 6.1 installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SL Micro 6.1 installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install: If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> 重引导。 Procedure: Updating the system 以 root 身份登录。 运行 transactional-update： transactional-update 重引导。 SL Micro is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates. However, this behavior is not desirable for the Uyuni environment. To prevent automatic updates on your server, Uyuni disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process. If you prefer the SL Micro default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command: systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer To continue with deployment, see 配置自定义永久性存储. Alternatively, you can deploy Uyuni on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. The following procedures describe the main steps of the installation process. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Extensions on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Locate and download SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 .iso at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/.

Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install): zypper up 重引导。 If you added Uyuni 2025.10 as an extension during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: SUSEConnect --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install. If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code. For example for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP7, use the following commands: SUSEConnect -r <regcode> SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.7/x86_64 SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with the following command: SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> Procedure: Installing podman Log in as root and install podman plus, on the server, mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion or, on the proxies, mgrpxy and mgrpxy-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): On the server: zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion On the proxies: zypper install podman mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service To continue with deployment, see 配置自定义永久性存储. 配置永久性存储空间并非强制性要求，但这是唯一可避免在容器全盘空间用尽的情况下出现严重问题的方法。强烈建议您使用 mgr-storage-server 工具来配置自定义永久性存储空间。 有关详细信息，请参见 mgr-storage-server --help。此工具可以简化容器存储和数据库卷的创建。 如下所示使用命令： mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] 例如： mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 此命令将在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes 中创建永久性存储卷。 有关详细信息，请参见 Persistent Container Volumes 对容器全盘空间用尽事件进行查错 If you want to use third-party SSL certificates instead of the self-signed certificates, import them in the run of the following deployment procedure. For more information about the requirements of third-party SSL certificates, see 导入 SSL 证书. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. 例如： export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. 过程：使用 mgradm 部署 Uyuni 2025.10 以 root 身份登录。 Deploy Uyuni. If you use VM images as a migration target, here as the last step, execute the command mgradm migrate instead of mgradm install. Execute one of the following commands, depending on the SSL certificate variant (self-signed or third-party). Replace <FQDN> with your fully qualified domain name of the Uyuni Server: Using self-signed certificates provided by Uyuni: mgradm install podman <FQDN> With importing SSL certificates using third-party SSL certificate flags (the example can adjusted if not all these certificates are needed): mgradm install podman <FQDN> \\ --ssl-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-server-cert <string> \\ --ssl-server-key <string> \\ --ssl-db-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-db-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-db-cert <string> \\ --ssl-db-key <string> For more information, see mgradm install podman --help. If the executed command fails ensure that you have registered Uyuni 2025.10. If you skipped registration during installation and now need to register from the command line, follow the steps below to log in to the registry: podman login-u <电子邮件地址> -p <注册代码> registry.suse.com 根据提示使用 Uyuni 2025.10 注册密钥。 Enter CA key (certificate authority) and administrator account password when prompted. 管理员帐户口令长度必须至少为 5 个字符且不超过 48 个字符。 按 Enter。 输入管理帐户的电子邮件地址。按 Enter。 等待部署完成。 打开浏览器并访问您的服务器 FQDN。 输入您的用户名（默认为 admin）以及在部署过程中设置的口令。 在本指南中，您已将 Uyuni 2025.10 服务器部署为容器。请继续阅读下一节来添加您的组织身份凭证，以便与 SUSE Customer Center 同步。 本节介绍如何通过 Web UI 与 SCC 同步，以及如何添加第一个客户端通道。 过程：输入组织身份凭证 打开浏览器并访问您的服务器 FQDN。 输入您的用户名（默认为 admin）以及在部署过程中设置的口令。 在 Uyuni Web UI 中，选择管理 安装向导。 在安装向导页中，选择 组织身份凭证 选项卡。 单击 添加新身份凭证。 在浏览器中访问 SUSE Customer Center。 在左侧导航栏中选择您的组织。 在页面顶部选择用户选项卡，然后单击 组织身份凭证。 记下您的镜像身份凭证。 返回 Uyuni Web UI，输入用户名和口令，然后单击 保存 确认。 在系统以绿色打勾图标的形式确认身份凭证后，请继续执行过程：与 SUSE Customer Center 同步。 过程：与 SUSE Customer Center 同步 在 Web UI 中，导航到管理 安装向导。 在安装向导页面中选择 SUSE 产品选项卡。如果您最近在 SUSE Customer Center 中注册过产品，则表格中将开始填充产品列表。此操作可能需要几分钟时间才会完成。您可在右侧的从 SUSE Customer Center 刷新产品目录部分监控该操作的进度。该产品表格会列出体系结构、通道和状态信息。有关详细信息，请参见 向导。 使用按产品说明过滤和按体系结构过滤来过滤显示的产品列表。产品 页面上列出的通道将为客户端提供储存库。 选中每个通道左侧的复选框将相应通道添加到 Uyuni。单击说明左侧的箭头符号可以展开产品并列出可用模块。 单击页面顶部的 添加产品 开始产品同步。 添加通道后，Uyuni 将安排该通道的同步。这可能需要较长时间，因为 Uyuni 会将通道软件源从 SUSE Customer Center 中的 SUSE 储存库复制到您服务器本地的 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/ 目录。 通道完全同步后，将自动为其生成引导储存库。此步骤对于成功引导客户端至关重要，可确保通道同步和分发能够在客户端正常运行。Uyuni 的安装和配置，以及为引导客户端准备所需通道的过程到此完成。 通道同步过程完成后，可以继续注册 Uyuni 2025.10 代理或其他客户端。 有关详细说明，请参见 客户端注册。 要在容器内访问外壳，请在容器主机上运行以下命令： mgrctl term","title":"Uyuni 2025.10 Server Deployment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"server-deployment-mlm","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This guide was tested on Tumbleweed only. There is no known reason it wouldn’t work on other supported bases, but always validate in a test environment before production. You will: Save proxy configuration from the old system (including Apache/Squid tuning). Reinstall the host with openSUSE Tumbleweed. Re-register the host using the system reactivation key. Install mgrpxy (and Podman if needed). Restore configuration and run mgrpxy install podman with optional tuning files. Keep the same hostname/FQDN and IP when possible so the server and clients interact with the proxy as before. Ensure you have the “system reactivation key” for the existing proxy system (UI: Systems > select the proxy > Details > Reactivation). Ensure SSH/scp access to move configuration archives off and onto the machine. Procedure: Save Proxy Configuration and Tuning Files Copy the Uyuni proxy configuration directory to a safe location: scp -r /etc/uyuni <USER>@<HOST>:/some/where/safe/ Identify Apache and Squid tuning files currently in use by the legacy proxy services: systemctl cat uyuni-proxy-httpd.service | grep EXTRA_CONF= | sed 's/.*=-v\\([^:]\\+\\):.*/\\1/' systemctl cat uyuni-proxy-squid.service | grep EXTRA_CONF= | sed 's/.*=-v\\([^:]\\+\\):.*/\\1/' Copy those tuning files to the same safe location as well. Typical default paths after you copy them back will be: Apache tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf Squid tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf Procedure: Reinstalling the Host with openSUSE Tumbleweed Reinstall the machine with openSUSE Tumbleweed (server profile recommended). Set the same hostname/FQDN and IP as before when possible. Procedure: Re-registering the Host with the Reactivation Key From the Uyuni Web UI, obtain the system reactivation key for the existing proxy system record (Systems > Details > Reactivation). Bootstrap/re-register the Tumbleweed host using that reactivation key so it claims the existing system entry. Use your standard bootstrapping process for Tumbleweed hosts in your environment (for example, the bootstrap script or your configuration management), ensuring the reactivation key is applied. Procedure: Installing Proxy Tools and Podman Add the Uyuni Stable repository and install tools: zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Proxy-POOL-x86_64-Media1 uyuni-proxy-stable zypper ref zypper in mgrpxy mgrctl mgrpxy-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion Ensure Podman is installed (required to run containers): zypper in podman Procedure: Restoring Configuration and Install the Proxy Copy back the saved configuration directory to the new host: scp -r <USER>@<HOST>:/some/where/safe/uyuni /etc/ If you saved Apache/Squid tuning files, place them at the expected default paths or note their locations for parameters in the next command: # Default paths expected by mgrpxy parameters (adjust/move your files accordingly) # Apache tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf # Squid tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf Run the proxy installation with Podman. If you do not use tuning files, omit the corresponding parameters: # With tuning files mgrpxy install podman \\ --tuning-httpd /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf \\ --tuning-squid /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf # If you have no tuning files, remove the tuning parameters: # mgrpxy install podman In an upcoming release, if tuning files are placed at the default paths noted above, the explicit parameters will not be required. Procedure: Verifying the Proxy Check containers are running: mgrctl ps # or podman ps Confirm the proxy appears healthy in the Uyuni Web UI and that clients using this proxy operate normally. If Podman was missing, install it and rerun the mgrpxy install step. Verify the host’s time, hostname, and IP match expectations. If the host did not reattach to the existing system record, confirm you used the correct reactivation key and repeat the bootstrap.","title":"Migrating the Uyuni Proxy to openSUSE Tumbleweed","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"migrate-uyuni-proxy-from-micro55-tumbleweed","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/migrate-uyuni-proxy-from-micro55-tumbleweed.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Install Uyuni tools and prerequisites on Tumbleweed. Restore the backup with mgradm backup restore. Start services and verify the server. Source server: openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 running Uyuni (for example: 2025.10). Target server: openSUSE Tumbleweed with the same hostname/FQDN and IP (recommended) to avoid client-side changes. SSH/scp access between machines for transferring the backup tarball. Sufficient free disk space on both source and target for the backup and restore. Restore to the same Uyuni version you backed up, or a version explicitly documented as compatible for restore. If you use development or preview repositories (for example, Uyuni Master), expect changes and re-validate.

In the context of this migration, the legacy Uyuni Server (RPM installation) is sometimes also called old server. Neither in-place migration is not possible nor allows the migration procedure currently any hostname renaming functionality. Thus the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the new server will remain identical to that on the legacy server. After migration, it is necessary to update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. For more information, see Finalize migration. SSL certificates are needed at a later stage. If not using the self-signed generated CA and certificates, ensure you have the following before starting: A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate. If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available. An SSL database private key. An SSL database certificate. All files must be in PEM format. The hostname of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on. You can set the hostnames in the X509v3 Subject Alternative Name section of the certificate. You can also list multiple hostnames if your environment requires it. Supported Key types are RSA and EC (Elliptic Curve). Database SSL certificate requires reportdb and db and the FQDN used to access the report database as Subject Alternative Name. During a migration, the server SSL certificate and CA chain are copied from the source server, meaning that only the database certificates are required 自信任 GPG 密钥不会被迁移。 仅在 RPM 数据库中可信的 GPG 密钥不会迁移。因此，使用 spacewalk-repo-sync 同步通道可能会失败。 The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the legacy Uyuni installation to the container host after the actual server migration. Procedure: Manual Migration of the GPG Keys to New Server Copy the keys from the legacy Uyuni server to the container host of the new server. 稍后，使用命令 mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> 将每个密钥添加到迁移的服务器。 The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the legacy server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration the processes on the legacy server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping the services on the legacy server. For example: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare Procedure: Initial Preparation on the Legacy Server 停止 Uyuni 服务： spacewalk-service stop 停止 PostgreSQL 服务： systemctl stop postgresql 过程：准备 SSH 连接 Ensure that for root an SSH key exists on the new 2025.10 server. If a key does not exist, create it with the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server host for a connection to the legacy server that does not prompt for a password. eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add To establish a connection without prompting for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server. If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add followed by the path to the private key. You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. Copy the public SSH key to the legacy Uyuni Server (<oldserver.fqdn>) with ssh-copy-id. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: ssh-copy-id <oldserver.fqdn> The SSH key will be copied into the legacy server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. For more information, see the ssh-copy-id manpage. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the legacy Uyuni Server to check that no password is needed. Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint. In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Then try again. The fingerprint will be stored in the local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. When planning your migration from a legacy Uyuni to a containerized Uyuni, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the legacy setup. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. 例如： export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. 配置永久性存储空间并非强制性要求，但这是唯一可避免在容器全盘空间用尽的情况下出现严重问题的方法。强烈建议您使用 mgr-storage-server 工具来配置自定义永久性存储空间。 有关详细信息，请参见 mgr-storage-server --help。此工具可以简化容器存储和数据库卷的创建。 如下所示使用命令： mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] Devices must not have any filesystem. The command aborts if a filesystem exists on the storage device. 例如： mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 此命令将在 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes 中创建永久性存储卷。 有关详细信息，请参见 Persistent Container Volumes 对容器全盘空间用尽事件进行查错 Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 迁移可信 SSL CA 证书。 Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on a legacy Uyuni in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the legacy installation after migration: 过程：迁移证书 Copy the file from the legacy server to the new server. 例如，复制为 /local/ca.file。 Copy the file into the container with the command: mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server. To redirect them to the new 2025.10 server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as the legacy server. If something goes wrong with the migration it is possible to restart the old system. As root, restart PostgreSQL and the spacewalk services with the following commands: service postgresql start spacewalk-service start Before executing the migration with mgradm migrate command, it is essential to predefine Persistent Volumes, especially considering that the migration job initiates the container from scratch. For more information, see the installation section on preparing these volumes in Persistent Container Volumes. Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server, replacing <oldserver.fqdn> with the appropriate FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 或 mgradm migrate kubernetes <oldserver.fqdn> After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server.

Before starting the conversion, ensure the following requirements are fulfilled. Already onboarded in Uyuni Reachable via the network Before proceeding with the proxy conversion, make sure the following preparations are completed to avoid interruptions during the conversion process. Valid SSL certificates are required to secure communication between the proxy and other components. You need: The public certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the certificate on the Uyuni server A certificate for the proxy. The corresponding private key for the proxy certificate. If your CA uses an intermediate certificate chain, you must include all intermediate certificates as well. If you are not using third party certificates, you can generate them using the rhn-ssl-tool inside the Uyuni container. Generate a proxy certificate On the Uyuni server host, run: mgrctl exec -ti -- rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server \\ --set-hostname=\"<PROXY-FQDN>\" \\ --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" For more information about other parameters, see 自我签名 SSL 证书. Transfer the certificates to Uyuni server host mgrctl cp server:/root/ssl-build/<PROXY-FQDN>/server.crt /root/proxycert.pem mgrctl cp server:/root/ssl-build/<PROXY-FQDN>/server.key /root/proxykey.pem mgrctl cp server:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT /root/rootca.pem To confirm the exact folder where the certificates and key files were generated, you can list the directories with: mgrctl exec -ti -- ls -ltd /root/ssl-build/*/ Transfer the certificates from Uyuni server host scp <UYUNI-FQDN>:/root/proxycert.pem ./ scp <UYUNI-FQDN>:/root/proxykey.pem ./ scp <UYUNI-FQDN>:/root/rootca.pem ./ The mgrpxy tool must be installed from a repository matching your system.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring-your-own-subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server or proxy. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in 公有云要求. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Server. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete the setup in the Uyuni Web UI. You must use the BYOS method. Start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launch a Uyuni Proxy instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Proxy BYOS images by searching for suse manager proxy. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in 公有云要求. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Proxy. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using SUSE setup tools.

Please remember that support processes may be different for deployments using your existing BYOS subscription and those billed via the cloud and note that there is currently no process for migrating deployments between BYOS and PAYG versions.

However, if Uyuni Monitoring is required for these instances, additional charges will apply for this feature. If using the Uyuni PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace, billing will commence from the time of deployment and when applicable client instances are on-boarded to Uyuni. There is the Uyuni BYOS listing in the cloud marketplace that can be used, a trial subscription key can be obtained via the SUSE Website. This deployment cannot be directly converted to allow billing via cloud marketplaces. To benefit from monthly billing via the cloud marketplace, Uyuni needs to be redeployed using the version from the PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace. Billing is based on the number of managed instances. Below are 3 examples of how the node count is calculated, check the table below for the detail. Static usage Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management, for 1 month with no additional managed clients added in the month. Bursting Model Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management for 3 weeks in the month, bursting to 30 managed instances for 1 week. Transient model A temporary deployment of Uyuni with 20 managed instances, for 2 weeks (336 hours) The total is calculated by counting number of active nodes (checked hourly). There is a monthly charge for each managed node under management in the billing cycle. Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated. Table 1. Usage calculations for different scenarios Managed Instances Peak Usage Billed for Static Usage 10 10 10 Bursting Model 10 - 3 Weeks, 30 - 1 Week 30 30 Transient Cluster 20 - 2 Weeks 20 20 It is dependent on the deployment and the cloud provider, as every Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has its own commercial terms and offers. It may be possible to secure special commercial terms such as an annual subscription. For example, AWS can offer Uyuni PAYG via a Private Offer. Please contact SUSE for more information. There are such programs at the cloud providers: Azure MACC Program AWS Enterprise Discount Program Google CUD Yes, it can. Please contact your cloud provider sales team for more details. Once Uyuni PAYG has been deployed from the marketplace listing and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase to manage additional instances. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of instances Uyuni is managing. Just on-board additional instances to Uyuni as needed, this will be reflected in your cloud marketplace bill. By default, the Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is ongoing for as long as Uyuni is deployed and instances are registered. Currently, there is no volume discount available. If you no longer require support, there are 2 options: Unregister all systems from the Uyuni Server Terminate the Uyuni instance.","title":"Billing - General","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-billing-general","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-billing-general.html","titles":[{"text":"I have an existing Uyuni BYOS subscription; can I use this on the cloud?","hash":"_i_have_an_existing_uyuni_byos_subscription_can_i_use_this_on_the_cloud","id":1},{"text":"I have an existing deployment covered by a BYOS Uyuni subscription; can I use this new listing in the cloud for a separate deployment of Uyuni PAYG?","hash":"_i_have_an_existing_deployment_covered_by_a_byos_uyuni_subscription_can_i_use_this_new_listing_in_the_cloud_for_a_separate_deployment_of_uyuni_payg","id":2},{"text":"Tell me more about how the billing for Uyuni PAYG works via the cloud?","hash":"_tell_me_more_about_how_the_billing_for_uyuni_payg_works_via_the_cloud","id":3},{"text":"I have existing SLES for SAP instances procured via the cloud provider marketplace, is there a cost to manage these instance with Uyuni PAYG?","hash":"_i_have_existing_sles_for_sap_instances_procured_via_the_cloud_provider_marketplace_is_there_a_cost_to_manage_these_instance_with_uyuni_payg","id":4},{"text":"Is there a way to try Uyuni PAYG before purchasing?","hash":"_is_there_a_way_to_try_uyuni_payg_before_purchasing","id":5},{"text":"How does SUSE calculate the amount of managed instances to bill for?","hash":"_how_does_suse_calculate_the_amount_of_managed_instances_to_bill_for","id":6},{"text":"Are special commercial terms available?","hash":"_are_special_commercial_terms_available","id":7},{"text":"Can my spending on Uyuni PAYG count towards my committed spend with the cloud provider?","hash":"_can_my_spending_on_uyuni_payg_count_towards_my_committed_spend_with_the_cloud_provider","id":8},{"text":"How do I purchase Uyuni / LCM subscriptions for additional managed instances?","hash":"_how_do_i_purchase_uyuni_lcm_subscriptions_for_additional_managed_instances","id":9},{"text":"Is this an annual commitment, will it auto-renew?","hash":"_is_this_an_annual_commitment_will_it_auto_renew","id":10},{"text":"Is there a volume discount / tiered pricing built into the Cloud Listing?","hash":"_is_there_a_volume_discount_tiered_pricing_built_into_the_cloud_listing","id":11},{"text":"I no longer require support; how can I end the Uyuni PAYG subscription?","hash":"_i_no_longer_require_support_how_can_i_end_the_uyuni_payg_subscription","id":12}]},"528":{"id":528,"text":"Currently, it is not possible to migrate an existing instance to the PAYG version. Customers can simply deploy a new Uyuni PAYG instance from the cloud marketplace and re-onboard all instances using the standard process. Client configuration overview It is simple to open a support case with SUSE for Uyuni PAYG. Create a ‘supportconfig’ via Uyuni PAYG instance CLI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) at the following link: https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport Providing marketplace billing is active, a support case will be opened. The Uyuni PAYG product available in the cloud marketplace is the same product, with similar functionality that you would run on-premises or with a manual installation. The only exceptions being the ability to bill via the cloud marketplace and connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure for Uyuni product updates. It is also worth checking the list of supported client operating systems to ensure your needs are met. It is recommended that the Uyuni instance always remains active. Uyuni PAYG, when deployed via the cloud marketplace will automatically connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure, no separate Uyuni subscription key is required. Updates to the Uyuni instance can be applied from those channels using standard SUSE tooling (i.e. zypper). Yes, Uyuni Hub is recommended for customers with more than 10,000 managed clients. If the Uyuni Hub instance has no connected clients, there will be no charge for the Uyuni Hub software components. Billing will occur from the downstream Uyuni PAYG Server instance, where managed instances are connected. To manage BYOS instances, SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Yes, it is possible to manage instances, in the cloud, on premises or both. To enable management of SUSE workloads in an on-premises data center, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider's network. With a hybrid landscape, egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider. To reduce these costs, SUSE recommend the use of the containerized proxy. Please note: Whilst the SUSE Manger Proxy usage is included as part of the Uyuni PAYG subscription, an LCM+ subscription will be billed if the proxy is also a managed workload, so in other words it counted as a managed client. No, to benefit from cloud marketplace billing, the Uyuni PAYG instance must reside on the cloud. Any Uyuni instances on premises will require their own subscriptions.

There are two tabs you need to fill out: Basics and Virtual Machine Settings. Project Details As with every resource in Azure, you need to provide a Resource Group (RG). This can be an existing RG or you can create a new RG for this deployment. Instance Details Region – where the instance should run. Virtual Machine Name – the name of the VM in which Uyuni will run. Username – the administrator account for the Uyuni VM. SSH Key Source and Key – needed to access the machine. We do not allow the use of a password here. This is to reduce the risk of brute force attacks. Managed Application Details Application Name – the name of the Managed Application. Managed Resource Group (MRG) – where the Uyuni VM and its resources will be deployed into. Instance Size The default for the instance size is D8as v5, which is a good baseline for a production server. It provides enough resources for more data disks and IOPS throughput for disk and network. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dasv5-dadsv5-series If you only need a test instance, you can go smaller and choose an instance size with 4 vCPUs and 16GB memory or use a B-Series (Burstable) instance with a similar configuration. Diagnostic Storage Account If you normally create a VM in the Azure portal, boot diagnostics are enabled by default using a managed storage account. You can choose an existing storage account or create a new one (default). OS Disk Size This is the root disk of the Uyuni installation, which holds: The OS and the Uyuni application. /var/cache – where you need to provide storage space for each product you want to manage. The proposed default of 100GB should be accepted. Database Disk Size This holds the Database for Uyuni and needs a minimum of 50GB. The proposed value of 80GB is a good default suggestion. Spacewalk Disk Size This holds the package repositories and should have at least 100GB. Additional requirements include: 50GB for every SUSE product. >360GB for every RedHat or other Linux product. The proposed default of 500GB is a safe default to start with. Repository synchronization will fail if this directory runs out of disk space. Public IP Address for the VM By default, a Public IP Address is created to access the Uyuni VM and Application. If you use it, please ensure this is secure and access is limited. Running Uyuni on the public cloud means implementing robust security measures. It is essential to limit, filter, monitor, and audit access to the instance. SUSE strongly advises against a globally accessible Uyuni instance that lacks adequate perimeter security. You should carefully consider this, as the Uyuni Server will have access to all managed nodes. If someone gains access to Uyuni, it would mean access to all managed nodes as well. Threat actors actively scan for accessible machines with open management ports (e.g., SSH or RDP), especially on cloud providers. A Network Security Group (NSG) is created by default if you choose to create a Public IP. It only allows inbound SSH access via port 22 as a minimal protection for the public IP. It is recommended to additionally restrict access to a defined list of networks and allow Azure’s virtual network to drop requests originating from other networks. Furthermore, you can add Just-in-Time access and/or use the Azure Bastion Service, Firewall, VPN, or private network methods to secure public access. You can choose not to create a Public IP address (which is more secure), but you will need to use other methods to access the created Uyuni VM and its Web UI for further configuration. Additionally, you must take care of the DNS and ensure a correct FQDN. DNS Prefix for the Public IP Address The Uyuni server must resolve its FQDN correctly. If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause issues in several Uyuni components. To ensure that the Uyuni domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server. You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured. If you use the Public IP address, a DNS name is automatically created from Azure. You only need to ensure that a unique name is used. The default suggestion creates one by including a random number to make the domain name unique. If you do not use the Public IP, you need to make sure that your setup can resolve the FQDN correctly as mentioned above. Virtual Network / Subnet You will see a default proposal for a virtual network where Uyuni will reside. By clicking edit, you can adjust it to your needs. Remember that a Managed Application will be deployed from SUSE to your Azure tenant. Therefore, this network is the network in the Managed Resource Group (MRG) and cannot overlap with existing networks. At a later stage, you need to peer this network to the network with the nodes you want to manage. Alternatively, you can create the managed nodes within this network. With all fields filled out, press Next or Create. The Azure portal will perform a final check and provide a summary screen of this deployment. If everything is correct, press Create to deploy the Managed Application for Uyuni. After the VM is deployed, you can access it via SSH. Usage and Costs Keep in mind that since this is a PAYG image, you will be billed according to your actual usage, including the number of systems you manage and monitor with this instance. It’s essential to regularly track and review your usage to prevent unexpected costs and ensure alignment with your needs.","title":"Initial Preparation and Configuration of the Microsoft Azure Managed Application","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"payg-azure-configure-the-image","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/payg/azure/payg-azure-configure-the-image.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Architecture Diagram of a managed application This resource group ( in the diagram ResGroup A ) holds the managed application instance, which could be translated as the metadata or definition of the offering. It can only contain a single resource. A customer has full access to the resource group and uses it to manage the life cycle of the managed application. This resource group ( in the diagram MRG ) holds all the resources that are required by the managed application. For example, an application’s virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks. A managed application is similar to a solution template in Azure Marketplace, with a few key differences: The resources are deployed into a managed resource group that is normally managed by the application’s publisher. It is present in the customer’s subscription, but an identity in the publisher’s tenant can be given access to the managed resource group. The publisher’s management access and the customers deny assignment are optional. There are different permission scenarios available. SUSE is using here the Customer managed to give our customers of SUSE Manager full control. Customer managed Customer Customer has full access to the solution (in the managed resource group) The customer manages the solution Publisher The publisher has no access to manage the solution.

To get the details, click on the name of the virtual machine. Here you can see the (public) IP address which you need to connect to the running instance. SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system . sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Remember, the Uyuni PAYG setup requires, that a new Virtual Network and a new subnet is configured, which was performed in the previous step. Because Uyuni PAYG is deployed as a 'Managed Application' it is not possible to deploy into an existing network. Before moving on to the next step, ensure the network is correctly configured: When you setup new clients which should be managed, take care that you put them into the private subnet which is configured with Uyuni PAYG or peer your networks. If you want to manage systems in an already existing network, you must configure peering. For more information, see Azure documentation. Procedure: Network Configuration Ensure the network configuration aligns such that hostname -f yields the identical name as the reverse DNS lookup of the private IP address. For instance, when executing nslookup 10.0.0.X. Insert the private IP with its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into /etc/hosts. For example: 10.0.0.4 instancename.location.internal.cloudapp.azure.com Edit /etc/sysconfig/network/config and append internal.cloudapp.azure.com to NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST. Execute netconfig update. Subsequently, hostname -f should return the same FQDN as obtained from nslookup 10.0.0.X. When adding new virtual machines (VMs), such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, it’s crucial to ensure that they are configured within the same subnet as the Uyuni instance, or that you have setup network peering. This step is essential for successful network setup and integration. Additionally, be mindful of the geographical restrictions associated with your plans. Make sure to utilize the appropriate Azure accounts which correspond to the specific geographic zones of your project. Procedure: Configuring Storage SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system: sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Configure storage using the appropriate tool: For a standard setup, use mgr-storage-server. For a proxy configuration, use mgr-storage-proxy.

An in-place migration from SUSE Manager 4.3 to 2025.10 is not supported, regardless of whether the chosen host operating system is SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Before migrating from SUSE Manager 4.3 to 2025.10, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt. For more information about migrating traditional Uyuni 4.3 clients to Salt clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html. Uyuni 5.0 及更高版本不再支持传统联系协议。 Before migrating a SUSE Manager 4.3 Proxy to Uyuni 2025.10, the SUSE Manager 4.3 Server needs to be migrated first, see 将 Uyuni 服务器迁移到容器化环境. In Uyuni 4.3, the proxy can be deployed using three different methods: RPM based containerized running on Podman containerized running on k3s In Uyuni 2025.10, RPM based support was removed, and only the containerized version running with podman or k3s is supported. Furthermore, the management of the containerized proxy running with Podman was re-designed and made simpler with the mgrpxy tool. Because an in-place migration is not supported, a deployment of a new Uyuni proxy with a new FQDN is required. For more information on deploying a new proxy on SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 see 安装 Uyuni 代理 . Before migrating the clients, ensure that the new Uyuni 2025.10 Proxy is already deployed and fully functional. Procedure: Migrating clients from the old to the new proxy 登录到 Uyuni 服务器 Web UI。 在左侧导航栏中，选择系统 系统列表。 导航到旧的 4.3 代理页面，然后单击代理选项卡。 在“SSM”中选择所有系统。 在左侧导航栏中，选择系统 系统集管理器。 选择子菜单其他 代理。 从下拉列表中选择要迁移到的新代理。 单击 更改代理。 所有选定的客户端现在都将迁移到新代理。您可以检查日程安排进度，以确认所有客户端是否已成功迁移。 After a few minutes, the clients will start to show the new connection path. When all clients have the connection path under the new proxy, the old SUSE Manager 4.3 Proxy system is not needed anymore and can be removed. Containerized proxies do not use tftpsync mechanism to transfer tftproot files. Instead these files are transparently downloaded and cached on demand. To prevent false positive errors during cobbler sync run, migrated 4.3 proxies need to be removed from tftpsync mechanism. If you previously configured a 4.3 proxy to receive TFTP files, one of the following configuration option is required: 要在容器内访问外壳，请在容器主机上运行以下命令： mgrctl term In the Uyuni 2025.10 server container, run configure-tftpsync.sh with the list of remaining 4.3 proxies as arguments. If no 4.3 proxies remain, run configure-tftpsync.sh with no arguments. In the Uyuni 2025.10 server container, manually remove the relevant proxy from the proxies setting in the /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml file.

An in-place migration from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.10 is not supported, regardless of whether the chosen host operating system is SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Before migrating from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.10, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt. For more information about migrating traditional Uyuni 4.3 clients to Salt clients, see Migrate Traditional Clients to Salt Clients. Uyuni 5.0 及更高版本不再支持传统联系协议。 This guide only covers the migration from Uyuni 4.3 to 2025.10. Migrating an existing Uyuni 2025.10 instance to the same version while switching the host operating system from SL Micro 6.1 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7, or vice versa, is not handled by the mgradm migrate command. Current migration procedure does not include functionality for renaming hostnames. As a result, fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the new server will remain the same as that of the old server. IP 地址必须保持不变，以确保客户端可以连接到服务器。 After the migration, it is necessary to manually update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. Self-trusted GPG keys are not migrated. GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated. Thus, synchronizing channels with spacewalk-repo-sync can fail. 在完成服务器的实际迁移后，管理员必须手动将这些密钥从所安装的 4.3 系统迁移到容器主机。 Procedure: Manual migration of the 4.3 GPG keys to the new server 将 4.3 服务器中的密钥复制到新服务器的容器主机。 稍后，使用命令 mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> 将每个密钥添加到迁移的服务器。 SSL certificates are needed at a later stage. If not using the self-signed generated CA and certificates, ensure you have the following before starting: A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate. If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available. An SSL database private key. An SSL database certificate. All files must be in PEM format. The hostname of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on. You can set the hostnames in the X509v3 Subject Alternative Name section of the certificate. You can also list multiple hostnames if your environment requires it. Supported Key types are RSA and EC (Elliptic Curve). Database SSL certificate requires reportdb and db and the FQDN used to access the report database as Subject Alternative Name. During a migration the server SSL certificate and CA chain are copied from the source server, meaning that only the database certificates are required Do not pre-install Uyuni on the prepared SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 system. The migration process is designed to perform the server installation automatically. Running mgradm install and then mgradm migrate is not supported and will lead to an unsupported system state. In the following steps, we are only preparing the host system, not installing the actual Uyuni 2025.10 Server. You can use VM images based on SL Micro 6.1 as a migration target. In such a scenario, you can prepare the host system as described in 将 Uyuni 2025.10 服务器部署为虚拟机 - KVM 或 将 Uyuni 2025.10 服务器部署为虚拟机 - VMware. However, at the end the last step is executing the command mgradm migrate <FQDN> instead of mgradm install <FQDN>. Procedure: Downloading the installation media Locate the SL Micro 6.1 installation media at https://www.suse.com/download/sle-micro/, and download the appropriate media file. 将下载下来的 .iso 映像放入一个 DVD 或 USB 闪存盘以进行安装。 For more information about preparing your machines (virtual or physical), see the SL Micro Deployment Guide. Procedure: Installing SL Micro 6.1 Insert the DVD or USB flash drive (USB disk or key) containing the installation image for SLE Micro 6.1. 引导或重引导您的系统。 使用箭头键选择安装。 Adjust Keyboard and language. 单击复选框接受许可协议。 单击下一步继续。 选择注册方法。在本示例中，我们将在 SUSE Customer Center 中注册服务器。 Uyuni 2025.10 容器会安装为扩展。根据以下列出的所需特定扩展，您还需要有各个扩展的 SUSE Customer Center 注册代码。 Uyuni 2025.10 服务器 Uyuni 2025.10 代理 Uyuni 2025.10 Retail Branch Server The SL Micro 6.1 entitlement is included within the Uyuni entitlement, so it does not require a separate registration code. 输入您的 SUSE Customer Center 电子邮件地址。 Enter your registration code for SL Micro 6.1. 单击下一步继续。 To install a proxy, select the Uyuni 2025.10 Proxy extension; to install a server, select the Uyuni 2025.10 Server extension Checkbox. 单击下一步继续。 Enter your Uyuni 2025.10 extension registration code. 单击 下一步 继续。 在 NTP 配置页面上，单击 下一步。 在系统身份验证页面上，输入 root 用户的口令。单击 下一步。 在安装设置页面上单击 安装。 This concludes installation of SL Micro 6.1 and Uyuni 2025.10 as an extension. If you added Uyuni 2025.10 as an extension during SL Micro 6.1 installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SL Micro 6.1 installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SL Micro 6.1 installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install: If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> 重引导。 Procedure: Updating the system 以 root 身份登录。 运行 transactional-update： transactional-update 重引导。 SL Micro is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates. However, this behavior is not desirable for the Uyuni environment. To prevent automatic updates on your server, Uyuni disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process. If you prefer the SL Micro default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command: systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer Alternatively, you can deploy Uyuni on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. The following procedures describe the main steps of the installation process. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Extensions on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Locate and download SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 .iso at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/. Make sure that you have regsistration codes both for the host operating system (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7) and extensions Start the installation of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. On the Language, keyboard and product selection select the product to install. On the License agreement read the agreement and check I Agree to the License Terms. Select the registration method. For this example, we will register the server with SUSE Customer Center. 输入您的 SUSE Customer Center 电子邮件地址。 Enter your registration code for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. 单击下一步继续。 Please note that for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7, you are required to have a valid SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscription and corresponding registration code, which you must provide on this screen. You will be required to enter the Uyuni Extension registration code below. In the screen Extensions and Modules Selection check the following: Select the Uyuni Server Extension to install the Server, or the Uyuni Proxy Extension to install the Proxy. Basesystem Module Containers Module 单击下一步继续。 Enter your Uyuni 2025.10 extension registration code. 单击 下一步 继续。 完成安装。 When the installation completes, log in to the newly installed server as root. Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install): zypper up 重引导。 If you added Uyuni 2025.10 as an extension during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: SUSEConnect --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install. If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code. For example for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP7, use the following commands: SUSEConnect -r <regcode> SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.7/x86_64 SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with the following command: SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> Procedure: Installing podman Log in as root and install podman plus, on the server, mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion or, on the proxies, mgrpxy and mgrpxy-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): On the server: zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion On the proxies: zypper install podman mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service This step ensures that the new Uyuni 2025.10 Server can connect to the existing 4.3 Server over SSH without requiring a password. It involves generating and configuring SSH keys, setting up an SSH agent, and copying the public key to the old server. This setup is required for the migration process to run without manual intervention. 过程：准备 SSH 连接 确保对于 root，新 2025.10 服务器上存在 SSH 密钥。如果不存在密钥，请使用以下命令创建一个： ssh-keygen -t rsa 新服务器上的 SSH 配置和代理应准备就绪，这样在连接 4.3 服务器时就不会提示输入口令。 eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add 迁移脚本依赖新服务器上运行的 SSH 代理来建立不提示输入口令的连接。如果该代理尚未激活，请运行 eval $(ssh-agent) 将其启动。然后，使用 ssh-add（后跟私用密钥的路径）将 SSH 密钥添加到正在运行的代理。在此过程中，系统将提示您输入私用密钥的口令。 使用 ssh-copy-id 将公共 SSH 密钥复制到 Uyuni 4.3 服务器 (<oldserver.fqdn>)。将 <oldserver.fqdn> 替换为 4.3 服务器的 FQDN： ssh-copy-id <old server.fqdn> SSH 密钥将会被复制到旧服务器的 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 文件中。有关详细信息，请参见 ssh-copy-id 手册页。 在新服务器上与旧的 Uyuni 服务器建立 SSH 连接，检查是否不需要口令。此外，主机指纹不得有任何问题。如果遇到问题，请从 ~/.ssh/known_hosts 文件中去除旧指纹。然后重试。指纹将存储在本地 ~/.ssh/known_hosts 文件中。 When planning your migration from SUSE Manager 4.3 to Uyuni 2025.10, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the old setup. 这包括但不限于内存 (RAM)、CPU 核心、存储和网络带宽。 Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. 例如： export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. When migrating from SUSE Manager 4.3, you will be prompted for the Password for the CA key to generate. It is essential to enter the same CA password that was used in your SUSE Manager 4.3 installation. Entering the wrong password will result in a failure to generate the database certificate and will cause the migration to abort with the following error: Error: cannot configure db container: Cannot generate database certificate: CA validation failed! Make sure the correct CA password is available before starting the migration process. Procedure: Performing the migration This step is optional. If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-server tool. For more information about mgr-storage-server, see installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#install-hardware-requirements-storage. Execute the following command to migrate and set up a new Uyuni 2025.10 server. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the 4.3 server: Make sure to upgrade your 4.3 server and apply all available updates before starting the migration process. Additionally, remove any unnecessary channels to help reduce the overall migration time. The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the old 4.3 server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration, the processes on the old 4.3 server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping of services on the old 4.3 server. mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare Procedure: Final migration Stop the SUSE Manager services on 4.3 Server: spacewalk-service stop Stop the PostgreSQL service on 4.3 Server: systemctl stop postgresql Perform the final migration on Uyuni 2025.10 Server mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 迁移可信 SSL CA 证书。 Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on Uyuni 4.3 in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the SUSE Manager 4.3 server after the migration. Procedure: Migrating the certificates Copy the file from the SUSE Manager 4.3 Server to the new Uyuni 2025.10 Server. 例如，复制为 /local/ca.file。 使用以下命令将文件复制到容器中： mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ 成功运行 mgradm migrate 命令后，所有客户端上的 Salt 设置仍会指向旧的 4.3 服务器。 要将其重定向到 2025.10 服务器，需要在基础架构级别（DHCP 和 DNS）重命名新服务器，以使用与 4.3 服务器相同的 FQDN 和 IP 地址。 Adjusting the IP address can be avoided if the latest version of the minion is installed on the clients, as the newer version can automatically re-connect with the server using only the FQDN. Uyuni 2025.10 introduces a rebranded set of client tools for all supported operating systems. This transition is seamless, and users performing a new product synchronization should only notice the updated channel names. Channels named SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ, used by clients previously registered with Uyuni 4.3 or 5.0, are no longer available in version 5.1 and will no longer receive updates in 5.1. Although the legacy channels remain assigned to existing clients after migration, the corresponding repositories have been removed. To ensure continued updates, users must: Mirror the new SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels for the relevant products and assign them to the appropriate clients. Unassign the outdated SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels. This also means that any CLM projects based on the old client tools must be adjusted accordingly. For example workflow, see Switch to new client tools channels.","title":"将 Uyuni 服务器迁移到容器化环境","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"server-mlm-43-51","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/migrations/server/server-mlm-43-51.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

If you have a Uyuni 5.0 proxy connected to this server, proceed to the Proxy Migration from 5.0 to 5.1 guide to upgrade the proxy host. Server migration or upgrade with mgradm migration or mgradm upgrade can create a volume with the database backup. When the PostgreSQL database version is increased, the old database must be stored in a separate location before running the upgrade. For this purpose mgradm dynamically creates the volume var-pgsql-backup. When the migration or upgrade is done and the user has validated that the new system is working as expected, this volume can be removed safely.

SUSEConnect --status-text Confirm: Base OS: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 Extension: SUSE Manager Server 5.0 Extension Apply all system patches. zypper patch Stop the server, and then reboot if the update stack was updated. mgradm stop reboot Launch the Zypper migration tool. zypper migration Zypper 会显示可能的迁移目标以及详细摘要。 选择适当的目标，并按照提示完成迁移。 After the migration completes, stop the server and then reboot the system. mgradm stop reboot Perform post-reboot checks: Verify upgraded OS and Uyuni extension. cat /etc/os-release SUSEConnect --status-text You should see: VERSION=\"15-SP7\" SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Server 5.1 Extension for SLE Verify Uyuni tools version. mgradm --version Expected output: Version 5.1.11 or higher Image tag 5.1.0 or higher Upgrade the server containers. mgradm upgrade podman Follow prompts to pull the new container images and reconfigure the environment. Check the running containers. podman ps Expected containers: server:5.1.0 or higher server-postgresql:5.1.0 or higher The system is now running Uyuni 5.1 on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Validate your setup before resuming production operations. If you have a Uyuni 5.0 proxy connected to this server, proceed with Proxy Migration from 5.0 to 5.1. Server migration or upgrade with mgradm migration or mgradm upgrade can create a volume with the database backup. When the PostgreSQL database version is increased, the old database must be stored in a separate location before running the upgrade. For this purpose mgradm dynamically creates the volume var-pgsql-backup. When the migration or upgrade is done and the user has validated that the new system is working as expected, this volume can be removed safely.","title":"Distribution Upgrade and Server Migration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"server-mlm-50-51","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/migrations/server/server-mlm-50-51.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
