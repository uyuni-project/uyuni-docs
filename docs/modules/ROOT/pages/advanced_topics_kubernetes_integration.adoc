[[at.k8s.integration.requires]]
== Prerequisites

The prerequisites listed below should be met before proceeding.

* At least one _Kubernetes_ or _SUSE CaaS Platform _ cluster available on your network
* {productname} configured for container management
+

[NOTE]
====
Required channels are present, a registered build host available etc.
====
+

* [package]#virtual-host-gatherer-Kubernetes# package installed on your {productname} server



[[at.requirements]]
== Requirements

* Kubernetes version 1.5.0 or higher.
Alternatively use SUSE CaaS Platform _(SUSE CaaS Platform includes Kubernetes 1.5.0 by default)_
* Docker version 1.12 or higher on the container build host

[NOTE]
====
To enable all Kubernetes related features within the {webui}, the [package]#virtual-host-gatherer-Kubernetes# package must be installed.
====



[[at.registering.kubernetes.as.a.virtual.host.manager]]
== Register Kubernetes as a Virtual Host Manager

_Kubernetes_ clusters are registered with SUSE Manager as ``virtual host managers``.
Registration and authorization begins with importing a `kubeconfig` file using Kubernetes official command line tool ``kubectl``.

.Procedure: Registering a Kubernetes Cluster with {productname}
. Select menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers] from the navigation menu.
. Expand the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner of the page and select menu:Kubernetes Cluster[] .
. Input a label for the new Virtual Host Manager.
. Select the `kubeconfig` file which contains the required data for the Kubernetes cluster.
. Select the correct _context_ for the cluster, as specified in the kubeconfig file.
. Click ``Create``.



[[at.view.the.list.of.nodes.in.a.cluster]]
== View the List of Nodes in a Cluster

. Select menu:Systems[Virtual Host Managers] from the navigation menu.
. Select the desired Kubernetes cluster to view it.
. Node data is not refreshed during registration.
To refresh node data, click on ``Schedule refresh data``.
. Refresh the browser.
If the node data is not available wait a few moments and try again.



[[at.obtain.runtime.data.about.images]]
== Obtain Runtime Data about Images

See the following steps to find runtime data for images.

. Select menu:Images[Images] from the navigation menu.
. In the image list table, take notice of the new runtime columns.
These are labeled: ``Revision``, `Runtime` and ``Instances``.
Initially these columns will not provide useful data.

** ``Revision``: An artificial sequence number which increments on every rebuild for manager-built images, or on every reimport for externally built images.
** ``Runtime``: Overall status of the running instances of the image throughout the registered clusters.
The status can be one of the following:
*** All instances are consistent with SUSE Manager: All the running instances are running the same build of the image as tracked by SUSE Manager.
*** Outdated instances found: Some of the instances are running an older build of the image.
A redeploy of the image into the pod may be required.
*** No information: The checksum of the instance image does not match the image data contained in SUSE Manager.
A redeploy of the image into the pod may be required.
** ``Instances``: Number of instances running this image across all the clusters registered in SUSE Manager.
A breakdown of numbers can be seen by clicking on the pop-up icon next to the number.



[[at.build.an.image.for.deployment.in.kubernetes]]
== Build an image for deployment in Kubernetes

The following steps will help you build an image for deployment in Kubernetes.

. Under menu:Images[Stores], create an image store.
. Under menu:Images[Profiles], create an image profile (with a Dockerfile which is suitable to deploy to Kubernetes).
. Under menu:Images[Build], build an image with the new profile and wait for the build to finish.
. Deploy the image into one of the registered Kubernetes clusters (via ``kubectl``).
. Notice the updated data in `Runtime` and `Instances` columns in the respective image row.



[[at.import.a.previously.deployed.image.in.kubernetes]]
== Import a Previously Deployed Image in Kubernetes

The following steps will guide you through importing a previously deployed image in Kubernetes.

. Select an image that has already been deployed to any of your registered Kubernetes clusters.
. Add the registry owning the image to SUSE Manager as an image store.
. Select menu:Images[Images] , click `Import` from the top-right corner, fill in the form fields and click ``Import``.
. Notice the updated data in `Runtime` and `Instances` columns in the respective image row.



[[at.obtain.additional.runtime.data]]
== Obtain Additional Runtime Data

The following steps will help you find additional runtime data.

. Select to menu:Images[Images] , click the `Details` button on the right end of a row which has running instances.
. Under the `Overview` tab, notice the data in `Runtime` and `Instances` fields under `Image Info` section.
. Select the `Runtime` tab.
. Here is a breakdown of the Kubernetes pods running this image in all the registered clusters including the following data:

** Pod name
** Namespace which the pod resides in
** The runtime status of the container in the specific pod.
Status icons are explained in the preceeding example.



[[at.rebuild.a.previously.deployed.image.in.kubernetes]]
== Rebuild a Previously Deployed Image in Kubernetes

The following steps will guide you through rebuilding an image which has been deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

. Go to menu:Images[Images] , click the Details button on the right end of a row which has running instances.
The image must be manager-built.
. Click the `Rebuild` button located under the `Build Status` section and wait for the build to finish.
. Notice the change in the `Runtime` icon and title, reflecting the fact that now the instances are running a previous build of the image.


[[at.role.based.access.control.permissions.and.certificate.data]]
== Role Based Access Control Permissions and Certificate Data

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, only kubeconfig files containing all embedded certificate data may be used with SUSE Manager
====

The API calls from {productname} are:

* GET /api/v1/pods
* GET /api/v1/nodes

According to this list, the minimum recommended permissions for {productname} should be as follows:

* A ClusterRole to list all the nodes:
+

----
resources: ["nodes"]
verbs: ["list"]
----

* A ClusterRole to list pods in all namespaces (role binding must not restrict the namespace):
+

----
resources: ["pods"]
verbs: ["list"]
----


Due to a a 403 response from /pods, the entire cluster will be ignored by SUSE Manager.
