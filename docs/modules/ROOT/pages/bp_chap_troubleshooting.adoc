== Registering Cloned Salt Minions

.Procedure: Registering a Cloned Salt Minion with SUSE Manager
. Clone your system (for example using the existing cloning mechanism of your favorite Hypervisor)
+
.Quick Tips
NOTE: Each step in this section is performed on the cloned system, this procedure does not manipulate the original system, which will still be registered to SUSE Manager.
The cloned virtual machine should have a different UUID from the original (this UUID is generated by your hypervisor) or SUSE Manager will overwrite the original system data with the new one.
+

. Make sure your machines have different hostnames and IP addresses, also check that /etc/hosts contains the changes you made and the correct host entries.

The next step you take will depend on the Operating System of the clone.

The following scenario can occur after on-boarding cloned Salt minions.
If after accepting all cloned minion keys from the onboarding page and you see only one minion on the System Overview page, this is likely due to these machines being clones of the original and using a duplicate machine-id.
Perform the following steps to resolve this conflict based on OS.

.Procedure: SLES 12 Registering Salt Clones
. SLES 12: If your machines have the same machine ids then delete the file on each minion and recreate it:
+

----
# rm /etc/machine-id
# rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
# dbus-uuidgen --ensure
# systemd-machine-id-setup
----


.Procedure: SLES 11 Registering Salt Clones
. SLES 11: As there is no systemd machine id, generate one from dbus:
+

----
# rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
# dbus-uuidgen --ensure
----


If your machines still have the same minion id then delete the minion_id file on each minion (FQDN will be used when it is regenerated on minion restart):

----
# rm /etc/salt/minion_id
----


Finally delete accepted keys from Onboarding page and system profile from SUSE Manager, and restart the minion with:

----
# systemctl restart salt-minion
----


You should be able to re-register them again, but each minion will use a different '/etc/machine-id' and should now be correctly displayed on the System Overview page.

[[bp.chapt.suma3.troubleshooting.registering.cloned.traditional.systems]]
== Registering Cloned Traditional Systems


This section provides guidance on troubleshooting cloned traditional systems registered via bootstrap.

.Procedure: Registering a Cloned System with SUSE Manager (Traditional Systems)
. Clone your system (using your favorite hypervisor.)
+
.Quick Tips
NOTE: Each step in this section is performed on the cloned system, this procedure does not manipulate the original system, which will still be registered to SUSE Manager.
The cloned virtual machine should have a different UUID from the original (this UUID is generated by your hypervisor) or SUSE Manager will overwrite the original system data with the new one.
+

. Change the Hostname and IP addresses, also make sure /etc/hosts contains the changes you made and the correct host entries.
. Stop rhnsd daemon with:
+

----
# /etc/init.d/rhnsd stop
----
+
or alternativly:
+

----
# rcrhnsd stop
----
. Stop osad with:
+

----
# /etc/init.d/osad stop
----
+
or alternativly:
+

----
# rcosad stop
----
. Remove the osad authentifcation configuration file and the systemid with:
+

----
# rm -f /etc/sysconfig/rhn/{osad-auth.conf,systemid}
----


The next step you take will depend on the Operating System of the clone.

.Procedure: SLES 12 Registering A Cloned Traditional System
. {empty}
+
If your machines have the same machine ids then delete the file on each client and recreate it:
+

----
# rm /etc/machine-id
# rm /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
# dbus-uuidgen --ensure
# systemd-machine-id-setup
----
. Remove the following credential files:
+

----
# rm  -f /etc/zypp/credentials.d/{SCCcredentials,NCCcredentials}
----
. Re-run the bootstrap script. You should now see the cloned system in SUSE Manager without overwriting the system it was cloned from.


.Procedure: SLES 11 Registering A Cloned Traditional System
. Continued from section 1 step 5:
+

----
# suse_register -E
----
+
(--erase-local-regdata, Erase all local files created from a previous executed registration.
This option make the system look like never registered)
. Re-run the bootstrap script. You should now see the cloned system in SUSE Manager without overwriting the system it was cloned from.


.Procedure: SLES 10 Registering A Cloned Traditional System
. Continued from section 1 step 5:
+

----
# rm -rf /etc/{zmd,zypp}
----
. {empty}
+

----
# ¡¡¡¡¡ everthing in /var/lib/zypp/ except /var/lib/zypp/db/products/ !!!!!
# check whether this command works for you
# rm -rf /var/lib/zypp/!(db)
----
. {empty}
+

----
# rm -rf /var/lib/zmd/
----
. Re-run the bootstrap script. You should now see the cloned system in SUSE Manager without overwriting the system it was cloned from.


.Procedure: RHEL 5,6 and 7
. Continued from section 1 step 5:
+

----
# rm  -f /etc/NCCcredentials
----
. Re-run the bootstrap script. You should now see the cloned system in SUSE Manager without overwriting the system it was cloned from.


[[bp.chapt.suma3.troubleshooting.osad.jabberd]]
== Typical OSAD/jabberd Challenges


This section provides answers for typical issues regarding OSAD and jabberd.

=== Open File Count Exceeded

``SYMPTOMS``: OSAD clients cannot contact the SUSE Manager Server, and jabberd requires long periods of time to respond on port 5222.

``CAUSE``: The number of maximum files that a jabber user can open is lower than the number of connected clients.
Each client requires one permanently open TCP connection and each connection requires one file handler.
The result is jabberd begins to queue and refuse connections.

``CURE``: Edit the [path]``/etc/security/limits.conf``
 to something similar to the following: `jabbersoftnofile<#clients + 100>
    jabberhardnofile<#clients + 1000>`

This will vary according to your setup.
For example in the case of 5000 clients: `jabbersoftnofile5100 jabberhardnofile6000`

Ensure you update the [path]``/etc/jabberd/c2s.xml``
 max_fds parameter as well.
For example: `<max_fds>6000</max_fds>`

``EXPLANATION``: The soft file limit is the limit of the maximum number of open files for a single process.
In SUSE Manager the highest consuming process is c2s, which opens a connection per client.
100 additional files are added, here, to accommodate for any non-connection file that c2s requires to work correctly.
The hard limit applies to all processes belonging to the jabber user, and accounts for open files from the router, s2s and sm processes additionally.

=== jabberd Database Corruption

``SYMPTOMS``: After a disk is full error or a disk crash event, the jabberd database may have become corrupted.
jabberd may then fail to start during spacewalk-service start:

----
Starting spacewalk services...
   Initializing jabberd processes...
       Starting router                                                                   done
       Starting sm startproc:  exit status of parent of /usr/bin/sm: 2                   failed
   Terminating jabberd processes...
----


/var/log/messages shows more details:

----
jabberd/sm[31445]: starting up
jabberd/sm[31445]: process id is 31445, written to /var/lib/jabberd/pid/sm.pid
jabberd/sm[31445]: loading 'db' storage module
jabberd/sm[31445]: db: corruption detected! close all jabberd processes and run db_recover
jabberd/router[31437]: shutting down
----

``CURE``: Remove the jabberd database and restart.
Jabberd will automatically re-create the database:

----
spacewalk-service stop
 rm -Rf /var/lib/jabberd/db/*
 spacewalk-service start
----


An alternative approach would be to test another database, but SUSE Manager does not deliver drivers for this:

----
rcosa-dispatcher stop
 rcjabberd stop
 cd /var/lib/jabberd/db
 rm *
 cp /usr/share/doc/packages/jabberd/db-setup.sqlite .
 sqlite3 sqlite.db < db-setup.sqlite
 chown jabber:jabber *
 rcjabberd start
 rcosa-dispatcher start
----

=== Capturing XMPP Network Data for Debugging Purposes


If you are experiencing bugs regarding OSAD, it can be useful to dump network messages in order to help with debugging.
The following procedures provide information on capturing data from both the client and server side.

.Procedure: Server Side Capture
. Install the [package]#tcpdump# package on the SUSE Manager Server as root: [command]``zypper in tcpdump ``
. Stop the OSA dispatcher and Jabber processes with [command]``rcosa-dispatcher stop`` and [command]``rcjabberd stop.``
. Start data capture on port 5222: [command]``tcpdump -s 0 port 5222 -w server_dump.pcap``
. Start the OSA dispatcher and Jabber processes: [command]``rcosa-dispatcher start`` and [command]``rcjabberd start``.
. Open a second terminal and execute the following commands: [command]``rcosa-dispatcher start`` and [command]``rcjabberd start``.
. Operate the SUSE Manager server and clients so the bug you formerly experienced is reproduced.
. Once you have finished your capture re-open terminal 1 and stop the capture of data with: kbd:[CTRL+c]


.Procedure: Client Side Capture
. Install the tcpdump package on your client as root: [command]``zypper in tcpdump``
. Stop the OSA process: [command]``rcosad stop``.
. Begin data capture on port 5222: [command]``tcpdump -s 0 port 5222 -w client_client_dump.pcap``
. Open a second terminal and start the OSA process: [command]``rcosad start``
. Operate the SUSE Manager server and clients so the bug you formerly experienced is reproduced.
. Once you have finished your capture re-open terminal 1 and stop the capture of data with: kbd:[CTRL+c]


=== Engineering Notes: Analyzing Captured Data


This section provides information on analyzing the previously captured data from client and server.


. Obtain the certificate file from your SUSE Manager server: /etc/pki/spacewalk/jabberd/server.pem
. Edit the certificate file removing all lines before ``----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----``, save it as key.pem
. Install Wireshark as root with: [command]``zypper in wireshark``
. Open the captured file in wireshark.
. From menu:Eidt[]menu:Preferences[] select SSL from the left pane.
. Select RSA keys list: menu:Edit[]menu:New[]
** IP Address any
** Port: 5222
** Protocol: xmpp
** Key File: open the key.pem file previously edited.
** Password: leave blank

[[bp.troubleshooting.timeouts]]
== RPC Connection Timeout Settings

(((connection timeout)))

(((timeout settings,RPC connection)))


RPC connection timeouts are configurable on the {productname} server, {susemgrproxy} server, and the clients.
For example, if package downloads take longer then expected, you can increase timeout values. [command]``spacewalk-proxy restart`` should be run after the setting is added or modified.

Set the following variables to a value in seconds specifying how long an RPC connection may take at maximum:

Server {mdash}[path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` :::
+

----
server.timeout =`number`
----
Proxy Server {mdash}[path]``/etc/rhn/rhn.conf`` :::
+

----
proxy.timeout =`number`
----
{sls} Clients (using [package]#zypp-plugin-spacewalk# ) {mdash}[path]``/etc/zypp/zypp.conf`` :::
+

----
## Valid values:  [0,3600]
## Default value: 180
download.transfer_timeout = 180
----
This is the maximum time in seconds that a transfer operation is allowed to take.
This is useful for preventing batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow networks or links going down.
If limiting operations to less than a few minutes, you risk aborting perfectly normal operations.

{rhel} Clients (using [package]#yum-rhn-plugin# ) {mdash}[path]``/etc/yum.conf`` :::
+

----
timeout =`number`
----



[[bp.troubleshooting.package.inconsistency]]
== Client/Server Package Inconsistency


In some cases, updates are available in the web interface, but not appearing on the client.
If you schedule an update on the client, it will fail with an error stating that no updates are available.
This can be caused by a metadata regeneration problem, or because update packages have been locked.

The notice that updates are available will appear immediately, but new metadata is only generated on the server after synchronizing.
In this case, an inconsistency can occur if taskomatic crashes, or because taskomatic is still running and creating new metadata.

To address this issue, check the [path]``/var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log`` file to determine if any processess are still running, or an exception which could indicate a crash.
In the case of a crash, restart taskomatic.

Check package locks and exclude lists to determine if packages are locked or excluded on the client:

On Expanded Support Platform, check [path]``/etc/yum.conf`` and search for ``exclude=``.

On SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, use the [command]``zypper locks`` command.



[[bp.troubleshooting.Corrupt.Repo.Data]]
== Corrupted Repository Data


If the information in [path]``/var/cache/rhn/repodata/sles{sles-version}-{sp-version-l}-updates-x86_64`` becomes out of date, it will cause problems with updating the server.
The repository data file can be regenerated using the [command]``spacemd`` command:


.Procedure: Rebuild repodata file
. Remove all files from [path]``/var/cache/rhn/repodata/sles{sles-version}-{sp-version-l}-updates-x86_64``
. Regenerate the file with `spacecmd softwarechannel_regenerateyumcache sles{sles-version}-{sp-version-l}-updates-x86_64`



[[bp.troubleshooting.Local.Issuer.Certificate]]
== Unable to Get Local Issuer Certificate


Some older bootstrap scripts will will create a link to the local certificate in the wrong place, which can cause problems with zypper returning an ``Unrecognized error`` about the local issuer certificate.
In this case, ensure that the link to the local issuer certificate has been created in [path]``/etc/ssl/certs/``, and consider updating your bootstrap scripts.
