Only Configuration Administrators or {productname} Administrators see the menu:Main Menu[Configuration] pages.

On this configuration pages, manage systems with configuration files, channels offering configuration files, and configartion files themselves.
Centrally-managed files are available to multiple systems; locally-managed files are available to individual systems only.

.Differences of System Types
[NOTE]
====
Configuration Managment is available for both client system types, traditionally managed clients ([Management]) and Salt minions ([Salt]).
Some traditional features are not suitable for Salt minions, and thus not available and excluded from the {webui}.
====

== Configuration Management for Salt


Configuration Management is now enabled for Salt.
The following matrix provides both supported and unsupported configuration management features.

.Missing {webui} Options
[IMPORTANT]
====
Several {webui} tabs will be missing for Salt Configuration Management.
These features are not suitable for Salt minions.
====

.Salt Configuration Management

[[ref.webui.config.preparing]]
== Preparing Systems for Configuration Management [Management]



To manage a traditional client's configuration with {productname}, it must have the appropriate tools and the [path]``config-enable`` file installed.
These tools will be available if you installed the system with the configuration management functionality using {ay} or Kickstart.
If not, they can be found in the Tools child channel for your distribution.
Download and install the latest [path]``rhncfg*`` packages:

* [path]``rhncfg`` -- the base libraries and functions needed by all [path]``rhncfg-*`` packages,
* [path]``rhncfg-actions`` -- the RPM package required to run configuration actions scheduled via {productname},
* [path]``rhncfg-client`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface to the client features of the Configuration Management system,
* [path]``rhncfg-management`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface used to manage {productname} configuration.


Installation of these packages can also be accomplished during bootstrapping if you enable [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` on the [guimenu]``Details`` page of the activation key after creating that activation key.
For more information about activation keys, see
ifndef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<s3-sm-system-keys-manage>>.

ifdef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<reference-webui-systems.adoc#s3-sm-system-keys-manage, Activation Keys>>.
endif::[]



[[ref.webui.config.overview]]
== Overview


The [guimenu]``Configuration Overview`` page shows all of the configuration files that are managed by your organization in {productname}.


image::configuration_overview.png[scaledwidth=80%]


This list includes files that are managed centrally in configuration channels and files that are managed locally via individual system profiles.

Configuration Summary::
The panel provides quick information about your configuration files.
Click the blue text to the right to display relevant systems, channel details, or configuration files.

Configuration Actions::
[guimenu]``Configuration Actions`` offers direct access to the most common configuration management tasks.
Deploy, compare, or create files on your systems.

Recently Modified Configuration Files::
The list shows which files have changed when and to which channel they belong.
If no files have been changed, no list appears.
Click the name of a file to see its [guimenu]``Details`` page.
Click the channel name to see its [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page.
+
File types that can appear here:
* image:spacewalk-icon-software-channels.svg[Spacewalk Icon Software Channels,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- Centrally-managed configuration file provided by a global configuration channel.
* image:fa-desktop.svg[FA Desktop,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- [Management] Locally-managed configuration file, maybe overriding a centrally-managed file.
* image:spacewalk-icon-sandbox.svg[Spacewalk Icon Sandbox,scaledwidth=1.6em] -- [Management] Sandbox configuration file.

Recently Scheduled Configuration File Deployments::
Each scheduled action is listed along with the status of the action.
Any scheduled configuration task, from enabling configuration management on a system to deploying a specific configuration file, is displayed.
Here you can quickly assess if all tasks have been successfully carried out or fix any problems.
Clicking the blue text displays the menu:System Details[Schedule] page for the specified system.



[[ref.webui.config.channels]]
== Configuration Channels

As mentioned above, {productname} manages both central and local configuration channels and files.
Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems (both traditional clients ([Management]) and Salt minions ([Salt])).
Local configuration management is available for traditional clients ([Management]) only and allows you to specify overrides or configuration files that are not changed by subscribing the system to a central channel.

A "`state channel`" is a type of a configuration channel but for Salt minion only.
For a state channel, the [path]``init.sls`` file is not auto-generated, the user creates and edits it.
Additionally, state channels can contain arbitrary configuration files that could be referenced from within the [path]``init.sls`` file.
Therefore, state channels effectively replace custom states.

.Referencing Configuration Files with Organization ID
[NOTE]
====
You must reference configuration files with the `salt://` prefix, the organization ID, and the channel name.
For example, to reference [path]``/etc/motd`` use:

----
file.managed:  - source: salt://manager_org_1/`channel_name`/etc/motd
----
====


Central configuration or state channels must be created via the links on this page.

Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel.
If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the [guimenu]``List/Remove Files`` page of that channel.
If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the menu:Configuration Channel Details[Systems > Subscribed   Systems] page for that channel.

To create a new central configuration channel:

[[proc.config.channels.create.cfgch]]
.Procedure: Creating Central Configuration Channel
. Click the [guimenu]``Create Config Channel`` link in the upper right corner of this screen.
. Enter a name for the channel.

. The following page is a subset of the [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page and has four tabs: [guimenu]``Overview``, [guimenu]``List/Remove Files``, [guimenu]``Add Files``, and [guimenu]``Systems``. The [guimenu]``Channel Details`` page is discussed in <<config-config-channels-channel-details>>.


[[config-config-channels-channel-details]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Configuration > Configuration Channels > Configuration Channel Details]

Overview::
The [guimenu]``Overview`` page of the [guimenu]``Configuration Channel Details``
page is divided into several panels.

Channel Information:::
The panel provides status information for the contents of the channel.

Configuration Actions:::
The panel provides access to the most common configuration tasks.
For Salt minions, there is a link to edit the [path]``init.sls`` file.

Channel Properties [Management]:::
By clicking the [guimenu]``Edit Properties`` link, you can edit the name, label, and description of the channel.

List/Remove Files::
This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel.
You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels.
Check the box next to files you want to manipulate and click the respective action button.

Add Files::
The [guimenu]``Add Files`` page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to [guimenu]``Upload``, [guimenu]``Import``, or [guimenu]``Create`` configuration files to be included in the channel.

Upload File:::
To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the btn:[Upload Configuration File] button.
The [guimenu]``Filename/Path`` field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed.
+
You can set the [guimenu]``Ownership`` via the [guimenu]``user name`` and [guimenu]``group name`` and the [guimenu]``Permissions`` of the file when it is deployed.
+
If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
+
If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
For more information on using macros, see <<s3-sm-file-macros>>.
+
Import Files:::
To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally-managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import.
Then click the btn:[Import Configuration File(s)] button.
+

NOTE: A sandbox icon (image:spacewalk-icon-sandbox.svg[Spacewalk Icon Sandbox,scaledwidth=0.9em]) indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox.
Files in a system's sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable.
Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel.
+


Create File:::
Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link from scratch to be included in the configuration channel.

.Procedure: Creating a Configuration File, Directory, or Symbolic Link From Scratch
... Choose whether you want to create a text file, directory, or symbolic link in the [guimenu]``File Type`` section.
... In the [path]``Filename/Path`` text box, set the absolute path to where the file should be deployed.
... If you are creating a symbolic link, indicate the target file and path in the [guimenu]``Symbolic Link Target Filename/Path`` text box.
... Enter the [guimenu]``User name`` and [guimenu]``Group name`` for the file in the [guimenu]``Ownership`` section, and the [guimenu]``File Permissions Mode``.
... If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure [guimenu]``SELinux contexts`` to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type).
... If the configuration file includes a macro, enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro.
... Then enter the configuration file content in the [guimenu]``File Contents`` field, using the script drop-down box to choose the appropriate scripting language.
... Click the btn:[Create Configuration File] button to create the new file.

Deploy Files::
This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel.
Deploy all files by clicking the btn:[Deploy All Files] button or check selected files and click the btn:[Deploy Selected Files] button.
Select to which systems the file(s) should be applied.
All systems subscribed to this channel are listed.
If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first.
To deploy the files, click btn:[Confirm & Deploy to Selected Systems].

Systems::
Manage systems subscribed to the configuration channel via two subtabs:

Subscribed Systems:::
All systems subscribed to the current channel are displayed.
Click the name of a system to see the [guimenu]``System Details`` page.

Target Systems:::
This subtab displays a list of systems enabled for configuration management but not yet subscribed to the channel.
To add a system to the configuration channel, check the box to the left of the system's name and click the btn:[Subscribe System] button.


[[ref.webui.config.files]]
== Configuration Files


This page allows you to manage your configuration files independently.
Both centrally-managed and locally-managed files can be reached from sub-pages.

.Maximum Size for Configuration Files
[NOTE]
====
By default, the maximum file size for configuration files is 128 KB (131072 bytes). {suse} supports a configuration file size up to 1 MB; larger values are not guaranteed to work.
====


ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2010-12-21 - ke: will "rhn" stay here? 2010-12-28 - kkaempf: "rhn" will
    stay here. #
endif::showremarks[]

To change the file size limit, edit all the following files on the {productname} server and edit or add the following variables:

----
# /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_web.conf
web.maximum_config_file_size = 262144

# /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/rhn_server.conf
maximum_config_file_size = 262144

# /etc/rhn/rhn.conf
web.maximum_config_file_size=262144
server.maximum_config_file_size=262144
----


Then restart [systemitem]``spacewalk``:

----
# spacewalk-service restart
----

[[configuration-files-central]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Configuration > Configuration Files > Centrally-Managed Files]


Centrally-managed files are available to multiple systems.
Changing a file within a centrally-managed channel may result in changes to several systems.
Locally-managed files supersede centrally-managed files.
For more information about locally-managed files, see
ifndef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<configuration-files-local>>.
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github,backend-html5[]
<<reference-webui-configuration.adoc#configuration-files-local, Locally-managed Files>>
endif::[]

This page lists all files currently stored in your central configuration channel.
Click the [guimenu]``Path`` of a file to see its [guimenu]``Details`` tab.
Click the name of the [guimenu]``Configuration Channel`` to see the channel's [guimenu]``Overview`` tab.
Clicking [guimenu]``Systems Subscribed`` shows you all systems currently subscribed to the channel containing that file.
Click [guimenu]``Systems Overriding`` to see all systems that have a local (or override) version of the configuration file.
The centrally-managed file will not be deployed to those systems.

[[configuration-files-local]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Configuration > Configuration Files > Locally-Managed Files] [Management]


Locally-managed configuration files apply to only one system.
They may be files in the system's sandbox or files that can be deployed to the system at any time.
Local files have higher priority than centrally-managed files.
If a system is subscribed to a configuration channel with a given file and additionally has a locally-managed version of that file, the locally-managed version will be deployed.

The list of all local (override) configuration files for your systems includes the local configuration channels and the sandbox channel for each Provisioning-entitled system.

Click the [guimenu]``Path`` of the file to see its [guimenu]``Config File Details``.
Click the name of the system to which it belongs to see its menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview] page.



[[s3-sm-file-macros]]
==== Including Macros in your Configuration Files


Being able to store one file and share identical configurations is useful, but what if you have many variations of the same configuration file? What do you do if you have configuration files that differ only in system-specific details, such as host name and MAC address?

Traditional file management would require to upload and distribute each file separately, even if the distinction is nominal and the number of variations is in the hundreds or thousands. {productname} addresses this by allowing the inclusion of macros, or variables, within the configuration files it manages.
In addition to variables for custom system information, the following standard macros are supported:
ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2010-12-21 - ke: will "rhn" stay here? 2010-12-28 - ke: see bug
    660807#c3 #
endif::showremarks[]


----
rhn.system.sid
rhn.system.profile_name
rhn.system.description
rhn.system.hostname
rhn.system.ip_address
rhn.system.custom_info(key_name)
rhn.system.net_interface.ip_address(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.netmask(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.broadcast(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.hardware_address(eth_device)
rhn.system.net_interface.driver_module(eth_device)
----


To use this powerful feature, either upload or create a configuration file via the [guimenu]``Configuration Channel Details`` page.
Then open its [guimenu]``Configuration File Details`` page and include the supported macros of your choice.
Ensure that the delimiters used to offset your variables match those set in the [guimenu]``Macro Start Delimiter`` and [guimenu]``Macro End Delimiter`` fields and do not conflict with other characters in the file.
We recommend that the delimiters be two characters in length and must not contain the percent (``%``) symbol.

For example, you may have a file applicable to all of your servers that differs only in IP address and host name.
Rather than manage a separate configuration file for each server, you may create a single file, such as [path]``server.conf``, with the IP address and host name macros included.

----
hostname={| rhn.system.hostname |}
ip_address={| rhn.system.net_interface.ip_address(eth0) |}
----


ifdef::showremarks[]
# 2010-12-21 - ke: will "rhn" stay here? #
endif::showremarks[]

Upon delivery of the file to individual systems, whether through a scheduled action in the {productname} Web interface or at the command line with the {productname} Configuration Client ([command]``mgrcfg-client``), the variables will be replaced with the host name and IP address of the system as recorded in {productname}'s system profile.
In the above example configuration file the deployed version resembles the following:

----
hostname=test.example.domain.com
ip_address=177.18.54.7
----


To capture custom system information, insert the key label into the custom information macro (``rhn.system.custom_info``). For example, if you developed a key labeled "``asset``" you can add it to the custom information macro in a configuration file to have the value substituted on any system containing it.
The macro would look like this:

----
asset={@ rhn.system.custom_info(asset) @}
----


When the file is deployed to a system containing a value for that key, the macro gets translated, resulting in a string similar to the following:

----
asset=Example#456
----


To include a default value, for example, if one is required to prevent errors, you can append it to the custom information macro, like this:

----
asset={@ rhn.system.custom_info(asset) = 'Asset #' @}
----


This default is overridden by the value on any system containing it.

Using the {productname} Configuration Manager ([command]``mgrcfg-manager``) will not translate or alter files, as this tool is system agnostic. [command]``mgrcfg-manager`` does not depend on system settings.
Binary files cannot be interpolated.



[[ref.webui.config.systems]]
== Systems


This page displays status information about your system in relation to configuration.
There are two sub-pages: [guimenu]``Managed Systems`` and [guimenu]``Target Systems``.




[[config-systems-managed]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Configuration > Systems > Managed Systems]

By default the [guimenu]``Managed Systems`` page is displayed.
The listed systems have been fully prepared for configuration file deployment.
The number of locally- and centrally-managed files is displayed.
Clicking the name of a system shows its menu:System Details[Configuration > Overview] page.
Clicking the number of local files takes you to the menu:System Details[Configuration > View/Modify Files > Locally-Managed Files] page, where you manage which local (override) files apply to the system.
Clicking the number of centrally-managed files takes you to the menu:System Details[Configuration > Manage Configuration Channels > List/Unsubscribe    from Channels] page.
Here you unsubscribe from any channels you want.



[[config-systems-target]]
=== menu:Main Menu[Configuration > Systems > Target Systems]


Here you see the systems either not prepared for configuration file deployment or not yet subscribed to a configuration channel.
The table has three columns.
The first identifies the system name, the second shows whether the system is prepared for configuration file deployment, and the third lists the steps necessary to prepare the system.
To prepare a system, check the box to the left of the profile name then click the btn:[Enable SUSE Manager Configuration Management] button.
All of the preparatory steps that can be automatically performed are scheduled by {productname}.

[NOTE]
====
You will need to perform some manual tasks to enable configuration file deployment.
Follow the on-screen instructions provided to assist with each step.
