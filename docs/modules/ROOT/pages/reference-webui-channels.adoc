The pages in the menu:Main Menu[Software] category enable you to view and manage software channels and packages associated with your systems.



[[ref.webui.channels.software]]
== Channels

The menu:Main Menu[Software > Channels] page is the first to appear.
A software channel provides packages grouped by products or applications to simplify the selection of packages to be installed on a system.

There are two types of software channels: base channels and child channels.

[[s3-sm-channel-list-base]]
Base Channels::
A base channel consists of packages built for a specific architecture and release.
For example, all of the packages in {sls}{nbsp}12 for the `x86_64` architecture make up a base channel.
The list of packages in {sls}{nbsp}12 for the `s390x` architecture make up a different base channel.
+

A system must be subscribed to only one base channel assigned automatically during registration based on the {sle} release and system architecture.
For paid base channels, an associated subscription must exist.
+

[[sm-channel-list-child]]
Child Channels::
A child channel is associated with a base channel and provides extra packages.
For example, an organization can create a child channel associated with {sls} on `x86_64` architecture that contains extra packages for a custom application.
+

Especially important are the {productname} Tools channels that are available for every base channel.
These tools channels provide the tools needed to connect the clients with the {productname} server.
+

A system can be subscribed to multiple child channels of its base channel.
Only packages provided by a subscribed channel can be installed or updated.
{productname} Administrators and Channel Administrators have channel management authority.
This authority gives them the ability to create and manage their own custom channels.
+

[NOTE]
====
Do not create child channels containing packages that are not compatible with the client system.
====
+

Channels can be further distinguished by relevance: [guimenu]``All``, [guimenu]``SUSE``, [guimenu]``Channels``, [guimenu]``My Channels``, [guimenu]``Shared``, and [guimenu]``Retired``.



[[s3-sm-channel-list-all]]
=== All

image::channels_details_channels.png[scaledwidth=80%]

In addition, [guimenu]``Per-User Subscription Restrictions`` can be set globally by {productname} administrators and channel administrators.
By default, any user can subscribe channels to a system.
To manage user permissions, select [guimenu]``Only selected users within your organization may subscribe to this channel`` and click btn:[Update].
The [guimenu]``Subscribers`` tab appears.
Click it to grant specific users subscription permissions to a channel.
{productname} administrators and channel administrators can always subscribe any channels to a system.

Only customers with custom base channels can change their systems' base channel assignments via the {productname} Web interface in two ways:

* Assign the system to a custom base channel.
* Revert subscriptions from a custom base channel to the appropriate distribution-based base channel.

[NOTE]
====
The assigned base channel must match the installed system.
For example, a system running {sle}{nbsp}11 for `x86_64` cannot be registered to a {sle}{nbsp}12 for `s390x` base channel.
Use the files [path]``/etc/os-release`` or [path]``/etc/SuSE-release`` to check your product, architecture (try [command]``uname -a``), version, and patch level.

The [guimenu]``Package Search`` page allows you to search through packages using various criteria provided by the [guimenu]``What to search for`` selection list:

* [guimenu]``Free Form`` -- a general keyword search useful when the details of a particular package and its contents are unknown.
* [guimenu]``Name Only`` -- Targeted search to find a specific package known by name.
* [guimenu]``Name and Summary`` -- Search for a package or program which might not show up in the respective package name but in its one-line summary.
* [guimenu]``Name and Description`` -- Search package names and their descriptions.

The [guimenu]``Free Form`` field additionally allows you to search using field names that you prepend to search queries and filter results by that field keyword.

For example, if you wanted to search all of the {sle} packages for the word `java` in the description and summary, type the following in the [guimenu]``Free Form`` field:

----
summary:java and description:java
----

Other supported field names include:

* ``name``: search package names for a particular keyword,

Finally, only cloned or custom patches may be added to custom channels.
Patches may be included in a cloned channel if they are selected during channel creation.

The [guimenu]``Sync`` tab lists patches that were updated since they were originally cloned in the selected cloned channel.
More specifically, a patch is listed here if and only if:

* it is a cloned patch,
* it belongs to the selected cloned channel,
* it has already been published in the selected cloned channel,
* it does not contain a package that the original patch has, or it has at least one package with a different version with regard to the corresponding one in the original patch, or both.


* Clicking the btn:[Sync Patches] button opens a confirmation page in which a subset of those patches can be selected for synchronization.
* Clicking the btn:[Confirm] button in the confirmation page results in such patches being copied over from the original channel to the cloned channel, thus updating corresponding packages.



[[s4-cnlmgmt-cdetails-pkgs]]

Several columns provide information for each mapping.


[NOTE]
.Using Distribution Channel Mapping
====
For {sle} or {rhel} {suse} does not use the [guimenu]``Distribution Channel Mapping`` feature.
It can be used for other products (for example, for free products such as openSUSE, Fedora, Oracle Linux, etc.).
It can help when letting clients pick up base channels automatically.
