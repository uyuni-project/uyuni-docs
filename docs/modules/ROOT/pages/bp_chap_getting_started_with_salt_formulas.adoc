This chapter provides an introduction for using Salt Formulas with {productname}.
Creation of custom formulas will also be introduced.



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.what]]
== What are Salt Formulas?

Formulas are collections of Salt States that have been pre-written by other Salt users and contain generic parameter fields.
Formulas allow for reliable reproduction of a specific configuration again and again.
Formulas can be installed from RPM packages or an external git repository.

The following list will help you in making the decision to use a state or a formula.

.Formula Tips
* When writing states for trivial tasks, formulas are probably not worth the time investment.
* For large, non-trivial configurations use formulas.
* Formulas and States both act as a kind of configuration documentation.
Once written and stored you will have a snapshot of what your infrastructure should look like.
* You can greatly decrease the amount of time required for writing a formula by grabbing one of the many pre-written formulas on github.
There are pre-written formulas for hundreds of configurations.
You can find these located at https://github.com/saltstack-formulas.

[NOTE]
.Formula with Forms Improvements
====
* Formula data can now be managed via the XMLRPC API
* New types were added to help SUSE Manager handle almost any kind of upstream formula.
====



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.install]]

[[best.practice.salt.formulas.filedir]]
== File Structure Overview

RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure proper functionality.
A formula always consists of two separate directories: The [path]``states`` directory and the [path]``metadata`` directory.
Folders in these directories need to have an exactly matching name, for example ``locale``.

The Formula State Directory::
The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently.
This includes [path]``.sls`` files, a [path]``map.jinja`` file and any other required files.
This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually.
For example, the [package]#locale-formula# states directory is located in:
+

----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/
----
The Formula Metadata Directory::
The metadata directory contains a [path]``form.yml``
file which defines the forms for {productname}
and an optional [path]``metadata.yml``
file that can contain additional information about a formula.
For example, the [package]#locale-formula#
metadata directory is located in:
+

----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/
----

Custom Formulas::
Custom formula data or (non-RPM) formulas need to be placed into any state directory configured as a Salt file root:

State directory:::
Custom state formula data need to be placed in:
+

----
/srv/salt/custom/
----

Metadata Directory:::
Custom metadata (information) need to be placed in:
+

----
/srv/formula_metadata/custom/
----

All custom folders located in the following directories needs to contain a [path]``form.yml`` file.
These files are detected as form recipes and may be applied to groups and systems from the {webui}:

----
/srv/salt/formula_metadata/`custom-formula-name`/form.yml
----



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.pillar]]
== Editing Pillar Data in {productname}

{productname} requires a file called [path]``form.yml``, to describe how formula data should look within the {webui}.
[path]``form.yml`` is used by {productname} to generate the desired form, with values editable by a user.

For example, the [path]``form.yml`` that is included with the [package]#locale-formula# is placed in:

----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml
----

See part of the following [package]#locale-formula# example:

[path]``form.yml`` contains additional information that describes how the form for a pillar should look for {productname}.
This information is contained in attributes that always start with a `$` sign.

[IMPORTANT]
.Ignored Values
====
All values that start with a `$` sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with.
These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata.
====

The following are valid attributes.

$type::
The most important attribute is the `$type` attribute.
It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated.
The following represent the supported types:

** `text`
** `password`
** `number`
** `url`
** `email`
** `date`
** `time`
** `datetime`
** `boolean`
** `color`
** `select`
** `group`
** `edit-group`
** `namespace`
** `hidden-group` (obsolete, renamed to ``namespace``)


[NOTE]
.Text Attribute
====
The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly.
====


Many of these values are self-explanatory:

** The `text` type generates a simple text field
** The `password` type generates a password field
** The `color` type generates a color picker.


The ``group``, ``edit-group``, and `namespace` (formerly ``hidden-group``) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data.
The difference between `group` and `namespace` is `group` generates a visible border with a heading, and `namespace` shows nothing visually (and is only used to structure pillar data).
The difference between `group` and `edit-group` is `edit-group` allows to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way.
For example, `edit-group` supports the `$minItems` and `$maxItems` attributes, and thus it simplifies complex and repeatable input structures.
For an `edit-group` example, see <<salt.formulas.ex.edit-group>>.

$default::
`$default` allows you to specify a default value that is displayed and used, if no other value is entered.
In an `edit-group` it allows to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data.

$name::
`$name` allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form.
If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes.
You reference it in the same section with ``${name}``.

$help and $placeholder::
The `$help` and `$placeholder` attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be.
** `$help` defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field
** `$placeholder` displays a gray placeholder text in the field.

`$placeholder` may only be used with text fields like text, password, email or date.
It does not make sense to add a placeholder if you also use `$default` as this will hide the placeholder.

$minItems and $maxItems::
In an ``edit-group``, `$minItems` and `$maxItems` allow you to specify the lowest and highest number the group can occur.

$itemName::
In an ``edit-group``, `$itemName` allows to define a template for the name to be used for the members of the group.

$prototype::
In an ``edit-group``, `$prototype` allows to define default (or pre-filled) values for newly added members in the group.

$scope::
`$scope` allows you to specify a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited.
Possible values are ``system``, `group` and ``readonly``.
+

The default `$scope: system` allows values to be edited at group and system levels.
A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default.
+

If using ``$scope: group``, a value may only be edited for a group.
On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it.
+

The `$scope: readonly` option makes a field read-only.
It can be used to show a user data which should be known, but should not be editable.
This option only makes sense in combination with the $default attribute.

$visibleIf::
`$visibleIf` allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met.
A condition always looks similar to the following example:
+

----
some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true
----
+

The left part of the above statement is the path to another value, and groups are separated by `$` signs.
The middle section of the command should be either `==` for a value to be equal or `!=` for values that should be not equal.
The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have.
+

The field with this attribute associated with it will now be shown only when the condition is met.
In this example the field will be shown only if `my_checkbox` is checked.
The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes.
It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, etc.
+

A check box should be structured like the following example:
+

----
some_group:
  $type: group

  another_group:
    $type: group

      my_checkbox:
        $type: boolean
----
+

Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot means sibling, 2 dots mean parent, etc. This is mostly useful for ``edit-group``.
+

----
some_group:
  $type: group

  another_group:
    $type: group

    my_checkbox:
      $type: boolean

    my_text:
      $visibleIf: .my_checkbox

  yet_another_group:
    $type: group

    my_text2:
      $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox

----
+

By using multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a user to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value.
+

// [NOTE]
// .Hidden Values
// ====
Values from hidden fields may be merged into the pillar data and sent to the minion.
A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data.
For example:
// ====
+
----
show_option:
  $type: checkbox
some_text:
  $visibleIf: show_option == true
----
+
----
{% if pillar.show_option %}
do_something:
  with: {{ pillar.some_text }}
{% endif %}
----

$values::
`$values` can only be used together with ``$type``: select to specify the different options in the select-field.
`$values` must be a list of possible values to select.
For example:
+

----
select_something:
  $type: select
  $values: ["option1", "option2"]
----
+

Or alternatively:
+

----
select_something:
  $type: select
  $values:
    - option1
    - option2
----



[[salt.formulas.ex.edit-group]]
=== Simple edit-group Example

See the following *edit-group* example:

----
partitions:
  $name: "Hard Disk Partitions"
  $type: "edit-group"
  $minItems: 1
  $maxItems: 4
  $itemName: "Partition ${name}"
  $prototype:
    name:
      $default: "New partition"
    mountpoint:
      $default: "/var"
    size:
      $type: "number"
      $name: "Size in GB"
  $default:
    - name: "Boot"
      mountpoint: "/boot"
    - name: "Root"
      mountpoint: "/"
      size: 5000
----

After clicking btn:[Add] for one time you will see <<fig-formula-custom-harddisk-partitions>> filled with the default values.
The formula itself is called [path]``hd-partitions`` and will appear as [guimenu]``Hd Partitions`` in the {webui}.

.`edit-group` Example in the {webui}
[[fig-formula-custom-harddisk-partitions]]
image::formula-custom-harddisk-partitions.png[]

To remove definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group.
When form fields are properly filled confirm with clicking btn:[Save Formula] in the upper right corner of the formula.



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.writing]]
== Writing Salt Formulas

Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states, which may be configured with pillar data.
You can parametrize state files using Jinja.
Jinja allows you to access pillar data by using the following syntax.
(This syntax works best when your uncertain a pillar value exists as it will throw an error):

----
pillar.some.value
----

When you are sure a pillar exists may also use the following syntax:

----
salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value')
----

You may also replace the `pillar` value with `grains` (for example, ``grains.some.value``) allowing access to grains.

Using data this way allows you to make a formula configurable.
The following code snippet will install a package specified in the pillar ``package_name``.
For example:

----
install_a_package:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: {{ pillar.package_name }}
----

You may also use more complex constructs such as `if/else` and `for-loops` to provide greater functionality.
For Example:

----
{% if pillar.installSomething %}
something:
  pkg.installed
{% else %}
anotherPackage:
  pkg.installed
{% endif %}
----

Another example:

----
{% for service in pillar.services %}
start_{{ service }}:
  service.running:
    - name: {{ service }}
{% endfor %}
----

Jinja also provides other helpful functions.
For example, you can iterate over a dictionary:

----
{% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %}
do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}
----

You may want to have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and you can change these with pillar data.
For example, the following snippet shows how you can manage a file using Salt:

----
/etc/my_program/my_program.conf:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf
    - template: jinja
----


Salt will copy the file [path]``salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf`` on the salt master to [path]``/etc/my_program/my_program.conf`` on the minion and template it with Jinja.
This allows you to use Jinja in the file, exactly like shown above for states:

----
some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }}
----



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.data]]
== Separating Data

It is often a good idea to separate data from a state to increase its flexibility and add re-usability value.
This is often done by writing values into a separate file named [path]``map.jinja``.
This file should be placed within the same directory as your state files.

The following example will set `data` to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on.
It will also merge data with the pillar using the `some.pillar.data` value so you can access `some.pillar.data.value` by just using ``data.value``.

You can also choose to override defined values from pillars (for example, by overriding `some.pillar.data.package` in the example).

----
{% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({
    'Suse': {
        'package': 'packageA',
        'service': 'serviceA'
    },
    'RedHat': {
        'package': 'package_a',
        'service': 'service_a'
    }
}, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %}
----

After creating a map file like the above example, you can easily maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing "deep" pillar data in a simpler way.
Now you can import and use `data` in any file.
For example:

----
{% from "some_folder/map.jinja" import data with context %}

install_package_a:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: {{ data.package }}
----

You can also define multiple variables by copying the `{% set ...%}` statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars.
For example:

----
{% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({
    'Suse': {
        'package': 'my-server-pkg'
    }
}, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %}
{% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({
    'Suse': {
        'package': 'my-client-pkg'
    }
}, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %}
----

To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma.
For Example:

----
{% from "map.jinja" import server, client with context %}
----

Formulas utilized with {productname} should follow formula conventions listed in the official documentation:

* https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.pillardata]]
== {productname} Generated Pillar Data

When pillar data is generated (for example, after applying the highstate) the following external pillar script generates pillar data for packages, group ids, etc.
and includes all pillar data for a system:

----
/usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py
----

The process is executed as follows:

. The `suma_minion.py` script starts and finds all formulas for a system (by checking the `group_formulas.json` and `server_formulas.json` files).
. `suma_minion.py` loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate (default: if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group etc.).
. `suma_minion.py` also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas.
This structure makes it possible to include states.
The top file (in this case specifically generated by the `mgr_master_tops.py` script) includes a state called formulas for each system.
This includes the `formulas.sls` file located in:
+

----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/
----
+

The content looks similar to the following:
+

----
include: {{ pillar["formulas"] }}
----
+

This pillar includes all formulas, that are specified in pillar data generated from the external pillar script.



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.req]]
== Formula Requirements

Formulas should be designed/created directly after a {productname} installation, but if you encounter any issues check the following:

* The external pillar script (``suma_minion.py``) must include formula data.
* Data is saved to [path]``/srv/susemanager/formula_data`` and the [path]``pillar`` and [path]``group_pillar`` sub-directories.
These should be automatically generated by the server.
* Formulas must be included for every minion listed in the top file.
Currently this process is initiated by the [path]``mgr_master_tops.py`` script which includes the formulas.sls file located in:
+

----
/usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/
----
+

This directory must be a salt file root.
File roots are configured on the salt-master ({productname}) located in:
+

----
/etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf
----



[[best.practice.salt.formulas.using]]
== Using Salt Formulas with {productname}

The following procedure provides an overview on using Salt Formulas with {productname}.


. Official formulas may be installed as RPMs.
Place the custom states within [path]``/srv/salt/your-formula-name/`` and the metadata ([path]``form.yml`` and [path]``metadata.yml``) in [path]``/srv/formula_metadata/your-formula-name/``.
After installing your formulas they will appear in menu:Salt[Formula Catalog].
. To begin using a formula, apply it to a group or system.
Apply a formula to a group or system by selecting the menu:System Details[Formulas] tab of a [guimenu]``System Details`` page or [guimenu]``System Group``. From the menu:System Details[Formulas] page you can select any formulas you wish to apply to a group or system.
Click the btn:[Save] button to save your changes to the database.
. After applying one or more formulas to a group or system, additional tabs will become available from the top menu, one for each formula selected.
From these tabs you may configure your formulas.
. When you have finished customizing your formula values you will need to apply the highstate for them to take effect.
Applying the highstate will execute the state associated with the formula and configure targeted systems.
You can use the btn:[Apply Highstate] button from any formulas page of a group.
. When a change to any of your values is required or you need to re-apply the formula state because of a failure or bug, change values located on your formula pages and re-apply the highstate.
Salt will ensure that only modified values are adjusted and restart or reinstall services only when necessary.
