=== SLES KVM Settings


This section provides guidance on installation of {productname}
utilizing the full installation media with KVM and [command]``virt-manager``.
This section assumes you have previously setup an account with SCC and downloaded the SLES full installation media.

.Procedure: Preparing for SLES Installation
. In [command]``virt-manager`` select menu:File[New Virtual Machine].

. Select btn:[Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)].

. Ensure btn:[Use ISO Image] is selected then click btn:[Browse] and locate the full SLES image you downloaded from your SCC account.

. Configure your machine with at least 4096 MB RAM and a minimum of 2 CPUs.

. Create a storage device with a minimum of 234 GB storage space for the installation.
During the partitioning setup of the SLES installation this disk should be partitioned into the following disks:
+

[cols="1", options="header"]
|===
| Disk Space Requirements
|4{nbsp}GB Swap space
|130{nbsp}GB XFS partition (or dedicated virtual disk) for [path]``/var/spacewalk/``
|50{nbsp}GB XFS partition (or dedicated virtual disk) for [path]``/var/lib/pgsql/``
|===

. The remaining storage space will be used by the operating system for the root partition.
Select btn:[Finish] to begin the installation.


Installation of {sls} will begin.
For more information on completing an installation of {sls}, see: https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_quickstarts/data/sec_sle_installquick.html[SUSE Linux Enterprise Installation Quickstart].
