You may already have experience managing your systems using {productname} 2.1.
The good news is all the features you are used to working with, (regarding the traditional stack) have not changed.
The only real exception is that the original built-in monitoring feature has been removed.
Icinga, a third party monitoring solution is included within the SUSE Manager Tools Channel for SLES 12.
{productname} {productnumber} supports managing systems via the popular IT orchestration engine Salt, in addition to the previously existing traditional management stack.

.Selecting a Management Method
[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot and should not mix a single system with both methods although you can have Salt managed systems and traditionally managed systems coexisting and managed by a {productname} server.
You may for example have a development department and assign all machines in this department as Salt minions, likewise you could also have a production department and assign machines as traditional bootstrap clients.
Remember a single machine is either traditionally managed or Salt but never both.
====


Keep in mind that minions are not traditional clients and their feature set is currently limited.
Future maintenance updates will provide feature parity over time and your feedback for prioritization of these features is welcome! The following tables provide a comparison between each feature set.
This includes features in development and features available only to their parent management stack.

[WARNING]
.Isolation Enforcement **
====
{productname} 2.1 is multi-tenant and organizations are completely isolated from one another.
This isolation includes both privacy and security.

For example: User A in Org_1 cannot see user B in Org_2.
(This relates to any data specific to an organization including: servers, channels, activation keys, configuration channels, files and so on.)

In {productname} {productnumber} Salt currently does not support any level of multi-tenancy and therefore information specific to an organization is accessible across organizations.
For example:

----
salt '*' cmd.run "some_dangerous_command"
----

The above command will target all organization, groups and single systems including their files, channels, activation keys etc.
This should be kept in mind when working with Salt.

The following table provides an overview of differences in functionality between {productname} 2.1 and {productnumber}.
