Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled{ldquo}GNU Free Documentation License{rdquo}. If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the “ with…​Texts.” line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.","title":"GNU Free Documentation License","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"common_gfdl1.2_i","url":"/uyuni/common_gfdl1.2_i.html","titles":[{"text":"0.

Salt와 기존 타 클라이언트 양쪽에서 작업 체인을 생성하여 작업이 특정 순서대로 실행되도록 설정할 수 있습니다. 작업 체인은 미리 생성 및 편집할 수 있으며 적절한 시간에 실행되도록 일정을 예약할 수 있습니다. 한 개 이상의 Salt 클라이언트에서 원격 명령을 수행할 수도 있습니다. 원격 명령을 사용하면 개별 Salt 클라이언트 또는 검색어와 일치하는 모든 클라이언트에 명령을 실행할 수 있습니다. 정기적 작업은 개별 Salt 클라이언트에도, 조직 내 모든 클라이언트에도 적용 가능합니다. 절차: 새 정기적 작업 생성하기 개별 클라이언트에 정기적 작업을 적용하려면 시스템으로 이동하여 일정을 구성할 클라이언트를 클릭하고 상태 정기적 상태 탭으로 이동합니다. 시스템 그룹에 정기적 작업을 적용하려면 Systems 시스템 그룹으로 이동하여 일정을 구성할 그룹을 선택한 후 상태 정기적 상태 탭으로 이동합니다. 생성을 클릭합니다. 새 일정의 이름을 입력합니다. 정기적 작업 빈도를 선택합니다. 매시간: 각 시간의 분을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 15는 매시 15분에 작업을 실행합니다. 매일: 매일의 시간을 선택합니다. 예를 들어, 01:00은 Uyuni 서버의 시간대에서 매일 0100시에 작업을 실행합니다. 매주: 매주 지정된 시간에 작업을 실행할 요일과 시간을 선택합니다. 매월: 매월 지정된 시간에 작업을 실행할 날짜와 시간을 선택합니다. 사용자 정의 Quartz 형식: 자세한 옵션을 보려면 사용자 정의 Quartz 스트링을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 매월 토요일 0215에 정기적 작업을 실행하려면 다음을 입력합니다. 0 15 2 ? * 7 선택 사항: 테스트 모드에서 일정을 실행하려면 테스트 모드 스위치를 토글합니다. 일정 생성을 클릭하여 저장하고 기존 일정의 전체 목록을 확인합니다. 조직 관리자는 조직의 모든 클라이언트에 대한 정기적 작업을 설정하고 편집할 수 있습니다. 홈 내 조직 정기적 상태로 이동하면 조직 전체에 적용되는 모든 반복 작업을 확인 가능합니다. Uyuni 관리자는 모든 조직의 모든 클라이언트에 대한 정기적 작업을 설정하고 편집할 수 있습니다. 관리 조직으로 이동하여 관리할 조직을 선택한 후 상태 정기적 상태 탭으로 이동하면 됩니다. 정기적 작업은 Salt 클라이언트에서만 사용할 수 있습니다. 그룹 또는 조직 내 기존 타 클라이언트는 무시됩니다. 클라이언트에서 순차 작업을 여러 개 수행해야 하는 경우 작업 체인을 생성하면 순서대로 작업할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 대부분의 클라이언트는 명령하는 즉시 작업을 실행합니다. 일부 경우에는 작업에 시간이 오래 걸리므로 이후에 실행된 작업이 실패할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 클라이언트에 재부팅을 명령한 후 두 번째 명령을 실행하면 재부팅이 아직 수행 중이므로 두 번째 작업이 실패할 수 있습니다. 작업이 올바른 순서로 발생하도록 하려면 작업 체인을 사용하십시오. 트랜잭션 업데이트 시스템의 경우 재부팅 작업이 남을 때까지 단일 스냅샷 내에서 작업 체인이 실행됩니다. 이로 인해 일부 제한이 발생할 수 있습니다.

Uyuni는 설치된 프로그램 및 구성뿐만 아니라 데이터베이스를 활용하기 때문에 설치의 모든 구성 요소를 백업하는 것이 중요합니다. 이 장에서는 백업해야 하는 파일에 대해 설명하고 데이터베이스 백업을 관리하는 smdba 도구를 소개합니다. 또한, 시스템 오류가 발생한 경우 백업에서 복원하는 방법에 대한 정보도 포함되어 있습니다. 백업 방법과 관계없이 현재 설치 작업 중 사용하는 공간의 세 배 이상을 사용할 수 있어야 합니다. 공간이 부족하면 백업이 실패할 수 있으므로 수시로 확인하십시오. Uyuni 설치를 백업하는 가장 포괄적인 방법은 관련 파일 및 디렉토리를 백업하는 것입니다. 이 방법을 사용하면 백업 관리 시간을 절약할 수 있으며 오류가 발생한 경우 더 빠르게 다시 설치 및 동기화할 수 있습니다. 그러나 이 방법은 상당히 큰 규모의 디스크 공간이 필요하고 백업을 수행하는 데 시간이 오래 걸릴 수 있습니다. 필수 파일과 디렉토리만 백업하려면 다음 목록을 사용하십시오. 이 프로세스를 더 간단하지만 더 포괄적으로 수행하려면 여기 언급된 디렉토리뿐만 아니라 /etc 및 /root 디렉토리를 통째로 백업하는 것이 좋습니다. 일부 파일은 관련 SUSE Manager 기능이 실제 사용될 때만 존재합니다. /etc/cobbler/ /etc/dhcp.conf /etc/fstab 및 필요한 모든 ISO 마운트 포인트. UUID가 변경된 경우 그에 따라 fstab 항목을 업데이트했는지 확인하십시오. /etc/rhn/ /etc/salt /etc/sudoers /etc/sysconfig/rhn/ /root/.gnupg/ /root/.ssh SSH 터널 또는 SSH push를 사용하는 경우 이 파일이 존재합니다. 또한, id-susemanager 키의 사본도 저장해야 합니다. /root/ssl-build/ /srv/formula_metadata /srv/pillar /srv/salt /srv/susemanager /srv/tftpboot/ /srv/www/cobbler /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ /srv/www/os-images /var/cache/rhn /var/cache/salt /var/lib/cobbler/ /var/lib/cobbler/templates/ (버전 4.0 이전에는 /var/lib/rhn/kickstarts/) /var/lib/Kiwi /var/lib/rhn/ /var/run/pgsql/ /var/lib/salt/ /var/run/salt/ /var/spacewalk/ 스크립트, 킥스타트 또는 AutoYaST 프로필, 사용자 정의 RPM과 같은 사용자 정의 데이터가 포함된 모든 디렉토리입니다. 또한, 데이터베이스도 백업해야 하며, 이 작업은 smdba 도구를 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다. 절차: 수동 백업에서 복원 Uyuni 서버를 다시 설치하십시오. 자세한 내용은 Uyuni 2023.02 서버 설치에서 확인할 수 있습니다. yast2 susemanager_setup으로 Uyuni 서버를 설정합니다. 자세한 내용은 SUSE Manager 서버 설정에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI를 사용하거나 명령 프롬프트에서 mgr-sync 도구를 사용하여 Uyuni 리포지토리를 다시 동기화하십시오. 제품을 다시 등록하거나 등록 및 SSL 인증서 생성 섹션을 건너뛸 수 있습니다. /root/ssl-build/rhn-org-httpd-ssl-key-pair-MACHINE_NAME-VER-REL.noarch.rpm 패키지를 다시 설치하십시오. rhn-search 서비스가 다음에 시작될 때 검색 인덱스의 재생성을 예약하십시오. 이 명령은 디버그 메시지만 생성하고 오류 메시지는 생성하지 않습니다. rhn-search cleanindex /var/spacewalk/packages/를 복원해야 하는지 확인합니다. /var/spacewalk/packages/가 백업에 없으면 복원해야 합니다. 소스 리포지토리를 사용할 수 있는 경우 전체 채널 동기화로 /var/spacewalk/packages/를 복원할 수 있습니다. mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels smdba 도구는 로컬 PostgreSQL 데이터베이스를 관리하는 데 사용됩니다. 데이터베이스를 백업 및 복원하고 백업을 관리할 수 있습니다. 또한, 데이터베이스 상태를 확인하고 재시작과 같은 관리 작업을 수행하기 위해 사용할 수도 있습니다. smdba 도구에 대한 자세한 내용은 [reference:cli-smdba]에서 확인할 수 있습니다. smdba 도구는 로컬 PostgreSQL 데이터베이스에서만 작동하며, 원격으로 액세스되는 데이터베이스 또는 Oracle 데이터베이스에서는 작동하지 않습니다. smdba 도구는 시스템 변경을 실행하기 위해 sudo 액세스 권한이 필요합니다. 시작하기 전에 다음 행에 대한 /etc/sudoers 파일을 확인하여 admin 사용자에 대해 sudo 액세스를 활성화했는지 확인합니다. admin ALL=(postgres) /usr/bin/smdba 다음을 사용하여 데이터베이스의 런타임 상태를 확인합니다. smdba db-status 이 명령은 online 또는 offline을 반환합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. Checking database core... online 데이터베이스 시작 및 중지는 다음을 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다. smdba db-start 및 smdba db-stop smdba 도구는 연속 아카이브 백업을 수행합니다. 이 백업 방법은 현재 세션 동안 데이터베이스에 적용된 모든 변경 사항에 대한 로그와 일련의 기존 백업 파일을 결합합니다. 충돌이 발생하면 먼저 디스크의 가장 최근 백업 파일에서 데이터베이스 상태를 복원한 다음 현재 세션의 로그를 정확하게 재생하여 데이터베이스를 현재 상태로 되돌립니다. smdba를 사용한 연속 아카이브 백업은 데이터베이스가 실행 중인 상태에서 수행되므로 작동 중지 시간이 필요하지 않습니다. 이 백업 방법은 안정적이고 일반적으로 일관된 스냅샷을 생성하지만 많은 저장 공간을 차지할 수 있습니다. 백업에 사용할 수 있는 현재 데이터베이스 크기의 세 배 이상인 공간이 있는지 확인하십시오. 현재 데이터베이스의 크기는 /var/lib/pgsql/로 이동하고 df -h를 실행하여 확인할 수 있습니다. smdba 도구는 아카이브를 관리하여 가장 최근 백업과 로그의 현재 아카이브만 유지합니다. 로그 파일의 최대 파일 크기는 16 MB이므로 파일이 이 크기에 도달하면 새 로그 파일이 생성됩니다. 새 백업을 생성할 때마다 디스크 공간을 확보하기 위해 이전 백업이 제거됩니다. 스토리지가 효율적으로 관리되도록 cron을 사용하여 smdba 백업을 예약하고 실패할 때를 대비하여 항상 백업을 준비하는 것이 좋습니다. smdba 도구는 명령줄에서 직접 실행할 수 있습니다. 설치 직후 또는 구성을 크게 변경한 경우 수동 데이터베이스 백업을 실행하는 것이 좋습니다. smdba를 처음 실행하거나 백업 위치를 변경한 경우 아카이브를 수행하기 전에 데이터베이스를 재시작해야 합니다. 이에 따라 약간의 작동 중지 시간이 발생합니다. 정기 데이터베이스 백업에는 작동 중지 시간이 필요하지 않습니다. 절차: 수동 데이터베이스 백업 수행 백업을 위한 영구 저장 공간을 할당합니다. 이 예에서는 /var/spacewalk/에 있는 디렉토리를 사용합니다. 이 작업은 백업의 영구적인 대상이 되므로 서버에서 항상 액세스할 수 있는지 확인하십시오. 백업 위치에서 백업을 위한 디렉토리를 생성합니다. 루트로 다음을 수행합니다. install -d -o postgres -g postgres -m 700 /var/spacewalk/db-backup 올바른 백업 위치 권한이 설정되어 있는지 확인합니다. chown postgres:postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup 처음으로 백업을 생성하려면 enable 옵션을 설정하고 smdba backup-hot 명령을 실행합니다. 이렇게 하면 지정된 디렉토리에 백업이 생성되고 필요한 경우 데이터베이스를 재시작합니다. smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup 이 명령은 디버그 메시지를 생성하고 출력하여 완료됩니다. INFO: Finished 백업 파일이 /var/spacewalk/db-backup 디렉토리에 있는지 확인하여 백업 성공 여부를 확인합니다. smdba를 사용하면 데이터베이스 백업을 수행하기 위해 시스템을 종료할 필요가 없습니다. 그러나 대규모 작업이기 때문에 백업이 실행되는 동안 데이터베이스 성능이 저하될 수 있습니다. 중단을 최소화하기 위해 트래픽이 적은 시간에 정기 데이터베이스 백업을 예약하는 것이 좋습니다. 현재 데이터베이스 크기의 세 배 이상의 공간을 백업에 사용할 수 있는지 확인합니다. 현재 데이터베이스의 크기는 /var/lib/pgsql/로 이동하고 df -h를 실행하여 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 자동 백업 일정 예약하기 백업을 위한 디렉토리를 생성하고 루트로 적절한 권한을 설정합니다. install -m 700 -o postgres -g postgres /var/spacewalk/db-backup /etc/cron.d/db-backup-mgr을 열거나 존재하지 않는 경우 생성하고 다음 라인을 추가하여 cron 작업 생성: 0 2 * * * root /usr/bin/smdba backup-hot --enable=on --backup-dir=/var/spacewalk/db-backup 백업 디렉토리를 정기적으로 확인하여 백업이 올바르게 작동하는지 확인합니다. mdba 도구를 사용하여 실패 시 백업에서 복원할 수 있습니다. 절차: 백업에서 복원 데이터베이스를 종료합니다. smdba db-stop 복원 프로세스를 시작하고 완료될 때까지 대기합니다. smdba backup-restore start 데이터베이스를 재시작합니다. smdba db-start RPM과 데이터베이스에 차이가 있는지 확인합니다. spacewalk-data-fsck 아카이브 로깅을 사용하면 데이터베이스 관리 도구 smdba를 사용하여 핫 백업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 기본으로 제공되는 데이터베이스가 있는 Uyuni에서는 아카이브 로깅이 기본적으로 활성화되어 있습니다. PostgreSQL은 제한된 수의 아카이브 로그를 유지 관리합니다. 기본 구성을 사용하면 크기가 16MiB인 파일이 약 64개 저장됩니다. 사용자를 생성하고 채널을 동기화합니다. SLES12-SP2-Pool-x86_64 SLES12-SP2-Updates-x86_64 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool-x86_64-SP2 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates-x86_64-SP2 PostgreSQL은 약 1GB의 추가 데이터를 생성합니다. 그러므로 백업 전략을 수립하고 백업을 정기적으로 생성하는 것이 중요합니다. 아카이브 로그는 /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog/(postgresql)에 저장됩니다. 데이터베이스 관리자는 space-overview 하위 명령을 사용하여 이미 사용 중인 테이블 공간에 대한 보고서를 확인할 수 있습니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. smdba space-overview 다음과 같이 출력됩니다.

Epoch 필드를 비워 둡니다. 버전 필드에 4.12.14를 입력합니다. 릴리스 필드에 150.17.1을 입력합니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 저장합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭합니다. 4.12.14-150.17.1 초과 커널 제외를 선택하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 빌드를 클릭하면 새로운 환경이 생성됩니다. 새 환경에는 설치한 버전까지의 모든 커널 패치가 포함되어 있습니다. 더 높은 커널 버전이 포함된 모든 커널 패치가 제거됩니다. 라이브 패치 커널은 시리즈의 첫 번째 커널인 경우를 제외하고 계속 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 절차는 필터 템플릿을 사용하여 자동화할 수 있습니다. 라이브 패치 필터 템플릿을 적용하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle.adoc#filter-templates에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 특정 커널 버전에 대한 라이브 패치는 한 해만 사용할 수 있습니다. 한 해가 지나면 시스템의 커널을 업데이트해야 합니다. 다음 환경 변경을 실행합니다. 절차: 새 커널 버전으로 전환 업그레이드할 커널 버전을 결정합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. 4.12.14-150.32.1 새 커널 버전 필터를 생성합니다. 이전 필터 4.12.14-150.17.1 초과 커널 제외의 연결을 해제하고 새 필터를 연결합니다. 빌드를 클릭하여 환경을 다시 빌드합니다. 새 환경에는 선택한 새 커널 버전까지의 모든 커널 패치가 포함되어 있습니다. 이러한 채널을 사용하는 시스템에는 설치를 위해 사용할 수 있는 커널 업데이트가 있습니다. 업그레이드한 이후에는 시스템을 재부팅해야 합니다. 새 커널은 일 년간 사용할 수 있습니다. 해당 연도에 설치된 모든 패키지는 현재 라이브 패치 커널 필터와 일치합니다. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 클라이언트를 사용하는 경우 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream 리포지토리와 같은 모듈형 리포지토리에서 직접 설치 또는 업그레이드와 같은 패키지 작업을 수행할 수 없습니다. AppStream 필터를 사용하여 모듈형 리포지토리를 일반 리포지토리로 변환할 수 있습니다. 패키지를 리포지토리에 유지하고 모듈 메타데이터를 제거하여 이를 수행할 수 있습니다. 결과 리포지토리는 Uyuni에서 일반 리포지토리와 동일한 방식으로 사용할 수 있습니다. AppStream 필터는 대상 리포지토리에 포함할 단일 모듈 스트림을 선택합니다. 여러 필터를 추가하여 여러 모듈 스트림을 선택할 수 있습니다. CLM 프로젝트에서 AppStream 필터를 사용하지 않으면 모듈형 소스의 모듈 메타데이터는 그대로 유지되고 대상 리포지토리에는 동일한 모듈 메타데이터가 포함됩니다. CLM 프로젝트에서 AppStream 필터가 한 개 이상 활성화되어 있으면 모든 대상 리포지토리가 일반 리포지토리로 변환됩니다. 일부 경우 모듈의 패키지를 포함하지 않고 일반 리포지토리를 구축하는 것이 가능합니다. 이를 위해서는 선택기 none (disable moduleity)를 사용하여 AppStream 필터를 추가하십시오. 그러면 대상 리포지토리의 모든 모듈이 비활성화됩니다. 이것은 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 클라이언트에 특히 유용합니다. 대부분의 모듈의 기본 버전은 AppStream 리포지토리에 일반 패키지로 이미 포함되어 있습니다. AppStream 필터를 사용하려면 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStream과 같은 모듈형 리포지토리가 있는 CLM 프로젝트가 필요합니다. 시작하기 전에 필요한 모듈을 소스로 포함했는지 확인하십시오. 절차: AppStream 필터 사용 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 같음을 선택합니다. 모듈 이름 필드에 모듈 이름을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, postgresql입니다. 스트림 필드에 원하는 스트림의 이름을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 10입니다. 이 필드를 비워 두면 모듈의 기본 스트림이 선택됩니다. 새 필터를 생성하려면 저장을 클릭합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭하고 새 AppStream 필터를 선택한 후 저장을 클릭합니다. 필터 생성/편집 양식의 찾아보기 기능을 사용하여 모듈형 채널을 위해 사용할 수 있는 모듈 스트림 목록에서 모듈을 선택할 수 있습니다. 절차: 사용 가능한 모듈 스트림 찾아보기 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 같음을 선택합니다. 모든 모듈형 채널을 보려면 사용 가능한 모듈 찾아보기를 클릭합니다. 모듈 및 스트림을 탐색할 채널을 선택합니다. 모듈 이름 필드에서 검색할 모듈 이름을 입력하거나 목록에서 선택합니다. 스트림 필드에서 검색할 스트림 이름을 입력하거나 목록에서 선택합니다. 채널 선택은 모듈 탐색을 위해서만 사용할 수 있습니다. 선택한 채널은 필터와 함께 저장되지 않으며 어떠한 방식으로도 CLM 프로세스에 영향을 미치지 않습니다. 대상 리포지토리에 포함할 다른 모듈 스트림에 대한 추가 AppStream 필터를 생성할 수 있습니다. 선택한 스트림이 활용하는 모든 모듈 스트림이 자동으로 포함됩니다. 충돌하거나 호환되지 않거나 누락된 모듈 스트림을 지정하지 않도록 주의하십시오. 예를 들어, 동일한 모듈에서 스트림을 두 개 선택하는 것은 적절하지 않습니다. 절차: 모듈성 활성화 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 없음(모듈성 비활성화)을 선택합니다. 새 필터를 생성하려면 저장을 클릭합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭하고 새 AppStream 필터를 선택한 후 저장을 클릭합니다. 이 작업을 수행하면 대상 리포지토리에서 모듈 메타데이터가 효과적으로 제거됩니다. 단, 모듈에 속한 패키지는 제외입니다. Web UI에서 빌드 버튼을 사용하여 CLM 프로젝트를 빌드할 때 대상 리포지토리는 선택한 모듈 스트림의 패키지를 포함하는 모듈이 포함되지 않은 일반 리포지토리입니다. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 프로젝트에서 모듈성을 모두 비활성화하면 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8이 정상적으로 작동하려면 일부 모듈이 필수적이므로 잘못된 환경이 구성할 수 있습니다.","title":"컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리 예제","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 월간 패치 주기에 대한 프로젝트 생성","hash":"create-proj-for-patch-cycle","id":1},{"text":"1.1. 날짜 기준 필터 생성","hash":"create-a-filter","id":2},{"text":"1.2. 프로젝트에 필터 추가","hash":"add-filter-to-proj","id":3},{"text":"1.3. 새 프로젝트 빌드에 필터 적용","hash":"apply-filter-to-project-build","id":4},{"text":"1.4. 프로젝트에서 패치 제외","hash":"exclude-a-patch","id":5},{"text":"1.5. 프로젝트에 패치 포함","hash":"include-a-patch","id":6},{"text":"2. 기존 월간 패치 주기 업데이트","hash":"update-a-patch-cycle","id":7},{"text":"3. 라이브 패치로 프로젝트 향상","hash":"enhance-project-with-livepatching","id":8},{"text":"3.1. 상위 커널 버전 패키지 제외","hash":"exclude-higher-kernel-version","id":9},{"text":"4. 라이브 패치를 위한 새 커널 버전으로 전환","hash":"switch-kernel-version-for-live-patching","id":10},{"text":"5.

Uyuni를 사용하면 다양한 유형의 필터를 생성하여 프로젝트 빌드에 사용되는 컨텐트를 제어할 수 있습니다. 필터를 사용하면 빌드에 포함되거나 제외되는 패키지를 선택할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 모든 커널 패키지를 제외하거나 일부 패키지의 특정 릴리스만 포함할 수 있습니다. 지원되는 필터: 패키지 필터링 이름 기준 이름, 에포크, 버전, 릴리스 및 아키텍처 기준 제공 이름 기준 패치 필터링 권고 이름 기준 권고 유형 기준 시놉시스 기준 키워드 기준 날짜 기준 영향을 받는 패키지 기준 모듈 스트림 기준 컨텐트 필터링 중에는 패키지 종속성이 해결되지 않습니다. 필터와 함께 사용할 수 있는 여러 선택기가 있습니다. 사용 가능한 필터 유형은 선택한 필터 유형에 따라 다릅니다. 사용할 수 있는 선택기: 포함 일치(정규식 형식이어야 함) 같음 큼 크거나 같음 작거나 같음 작음 이상 각 필터에는 허용 또는 거부로 설정할 수 있는 규칙 파라미터가 있습니다. 필터는 다음과 같이 처리됩니다. 패키지 또는 패치가 거부 필터를 충족하면 결과에서 제외됩니다. 패키지 또는 패치가 허용 필터를 충족하면 결과에 포함됩니다(거부 필터에 의해 제외된 경우에도 해당). 이 동작은 일반 거부 필터를 사용하여 많은 수의 패키지 또는 패치를 제외하고 특정 허용 필터가 적용된 특정 패키지 또는 패치를 \"선별\"하려는 경우에 유용합니다. 컨텐트 필터는 조직 전체에 적용되며 프로젝트 간에 공유할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트에 이미 빌드된 소스가 포함되어 있는 경우 환경을 추가하면 기존 내용이 자동으로 채워집니다. 내용은 주기의 이전 환경이 있는 경우 해당 환경에서 가져옵니다. 이전 환경이 없으면 프로젝트 소스가 다시 빌드될 때까지 비어 있습니다. 몇 가지 일반적인 시나리오에 대한 필터를 편리하게 생성할 수 있도록 Uyuni는 필터 템플릿을 제공합니다. 이러한 템플릿을 적용하면 특정 사용 사례에 맞게 사전에 필터 집합을 만드는 데 유용합니다. 이 섹션에서는 사용할 수 있는 템플릿과 그 사용법에 대해 설명합니다. 라이브 패치가 포함된 프로젝트에서는 정기적인 향후 커널 패키지를 제외해야 라이브 패치 패키지만 클라이언트에 대한 업데이트로 제공됩니다. 반면에 이미 설치된 일반 커널 패키지는 시스템 무결성을 유지하기 위해 여전히 포함되어야 합니다. 이 템플릿을 적용하면 이 동작을 수행하기 위해 필요한 필터 세 개가 생성됩니다. 기본 커널 버전과 동일한 kernel-default 패키지를 포함하는 패치 허용 reboot_suggested 키워드가 포함된 패치 거부 installhint(reboot-needed)라는 이름을 제공하는 패키지가 포함된 패치 거부 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터로 이동하고 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 개별 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 SUSE 제품 기반 라이브 패치를 선택합니다. 제품 필드에서 라이브 패치를 설정할 제품을 선택합니다. 커널 필드의 선택한 제품에서 사용할 수 있는 버전 목록에서 커널 버전을 선택합니다. 이후의 일반 커널 패치를 거부하는 필터는 이 버전을 기반으로 합니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭합니다. 지정된 접두사가 있는 필터 세 개를 선택하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 등록된 특정 시스템에 설치된 커널 버전을 기반으로 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하려면 \"시스템 기반 라이브 패치\" 템플릿을 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 템플릿을 적용하면 이 동작을 수행하기 위해 필요한 필터 세 개가 생성됩니다. 기본 커널 버전과 동일한 kernel-default 패키지를 포함하는 패치 허용 reboot_suggested 키워드가 포함된 패치 거부 installhint(reboot-needed)라는 이름을 제공하는 패키지가 포함된 패치 거부 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터로 이동하고 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 특정 시스템에 기반 라이브 패치를 선택합니다. 시스템 필드에서, 목록에서 시스템을 선택하거나 시스템 이름을 입력하여 옵션 범위를 좁힙니다. 커널 필드에서 선택한 시스템에 설치된 버전 목록에서 커널 버전을 선택합니다. 이후의 일반 커널 패치를 거부하는 필터는 이 버전을 기반으로 합니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭합니다. 지정된 접두사가 있는 필터 세 개를 선택하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 프로젝트에 포함된 모듈형 리포지토리에서 모든 모듈을 사용할 수 있도록 하려면 이 필터 템플릿을 사용하여 자동으로 추가할 수 있습니다. 적용되면 이 템플릿은 모듈 및 기본 스트림별로 AppStream 필터를 생성합니다. 이 프로세스가 프로젝트 페이지에서 수행되면 필터가 프로젝트에 자동으로 추가됩니다. 그렇지 않으면 생성된 필터를 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터에 나열하고 필요에 따라 모든 프로젝트에 추가할 수도 있습니다. 각 개별 필터를 편집하여 다른 모듈 스트림을 선택하거나 완전히 제거하여 대상 리포지토리에서 해당 모듈을 제외할 수 있습니다. 모든 모듈 스트림이 서로 호환되는 것은 아니므로, 개별 스트림을 변경하면 모듈 종속성을 성공적으로 해결하지 못할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 프로젝트 세부 사항 페이지의 필터 창에 문제를 설명하는 오류가 표시되고 모든 모듈 선택이 호환될 때까지 빌드 버튼이 비활성화됩니다. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 이상 모듈에는 정의된 기본 스트림이 없습니다. 그러므로 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9개의 소스와 함께 이 템플릿을 사용해도 효과가 없습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리를 사용하여 AppStream 리포지토리를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 섹션에서 필터 연결/해제를 클릭한 후 새 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 기본값 포함 AppStream 모듈을 선택합니다. 채널 필드에서 모듈을 가져올 모듈형 채널을 선택합니다. 이 드롭다운에는 모듈형 채널만 표시됩니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 필터 섹션으로 스크롤하여 새로 연결된 AppStream 필터를 확인합니다. 개별 필터를 편집/제거하여 필요한 대로 프로젝트를 조정할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트를 생성하고 환경을 정의하며 소스와 필터를 첨부하면 처음으로 프로젝트를 빌드할 수 있습니다. 빌드는 연결된 소스에 필터를 적용하고 이를 프로젝트의 첫 번째 환경에 복제합니다. 동일한 벤더 채널을 여러 컨텐트 프로젝트의 소스로 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 Uyuni는 복제된 각 채널에 대해 새 패치 복제를 생성하지 않습니다. 대신 단일 패치 클론이 복제된 모든 채널 간에 공유됩니다. 벤더가 패치를 수정하면 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 패치가 철회되거나 패치 내의 패키지가 변경된 경우가 이에 해당합니다. 컨텐트 프로젝트 중 하나를 빌드하면 채널이 컨텐트 프로젝트의 다른 환경이나 조직의 다른 컨텐트 프로젝트 채널에 있더라도 복제된 패치를 공유하는 모든 채널이 기본적으로 원본과 동기화됩니다. 조직 설정에서 자동 패치 동기화를 해제하여 이 동작을 변경할 수 있습니다. 나중에 패치를 공유하는 모든 채널에 대해 수동으로 패치를 동기화하려면 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하고 동기화하려는 채널을 클릭한 후 동기화 하위 탭으로 이동합니다. 수동 패치 동기화도 패치를 공유하는 모든 조직 채널에 영향을 미칩니다. 절차: 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트 빌드 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하고 빌드할 프로젝트를 선택합니다. Make sure you have the environment available before building the project. 첨부된 소스 및 필터를 검토하고 빌드를 클릭합니다. 이 빌드의 변경 또는 업데이트 사항을 설명하는 버전 메시지를 제공합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 빌드 진행 상황을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 빌드가 완료되면 환경 버전이 하나씩 증가하고 소프트웨어 채널과 같이 빌드된 소스를 클라이언트에 할당할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트가 빌드되면 빌드된 소스를 순차적으로 환경으로 승격할 수 있습니다. 절차: 환경 승격 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하고 작업할 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 후속 환경으로 승격할 환경을 찾고 승격을 클릭합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 빌드 진행 상황을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트를 빌드 및 승격할 때 Uyuni는 소프트웨어 채널 트리를 생성합니다. 환경에 클라이언트를 추가하려면 클라이언트의 시스템 세부 정보 페이지의 소프트웨어 소프트웨어 채널을 사용하여 기본 및 하위 소프트웨어 채널을 클라이언트에 할당합니다. 새로 추가된 복제된 채널은 클라이언트에 자동으로 할당되지 않습니다. 소스를 추가 또는 승격하는 경우 채널 할당을 수동으로 확인하고 업데이트해야 합니다. 자동 할당은 향후 버전에서 Uyuni에 추가될 예정입니다.","title":"컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트 생성","hash":"_컨텐트_라이프싸이클_프로젝트_생성","id":1},{"text":"2. 필터 유형","hash":"_필터_유형","id":2},{"text":"2.1. 필터 규칙 파라미터","hash":"_필터_규칙_파라미터","id":3},{"text":"3. 필터 템플릿","hash":"filter-templates","id":4},{"text":"3.1.

Uyuni Web UI에서 채널을 생성하고 패키지에 대한 리포지토리를 생성한 후 시스템에 채널을 할당해야 합니다. 클라이언트 시스템과 호환되지 않는 패키지가 포함된 하위 채널을 생성하지 마십시오. 벤더에서 제공하는 패키지를 사용하려면 벤더 채널을 기본 채널로 선택할 수 있습니다. 또는, 없음을 선택하여 사용자 정의 채널을 기본 채널로 설정합니다. 절차: 사용자 정의 채널 생성 Uyuni Web UI에서 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하고 채널 생성을 클릭합니다. 소프트웨어 채널 생성 페이지에서, 채널에 이름(예: My Tools SLES 15 SP1 x86_64) 및 레이블(예: my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64)을 지정합니다. 레이블에는 공백 또는 대문자를 포함하지 않아야 합니다. 상위 채널 드롭다운에서 관련 기본 채널(예: SLE-Product-SLES15-SP1-Pool for x86_64)을 선택합니다. 패키지에 대해 호환되는 상위 채널을 선택했는지 확인합니다. 아키텍처 드롭다운에서 적절한 하드웨어 아키텍처(예: x86_64)를 선택합니다. 필요한 대로, 연락처 세부 정보, 채널 액세스 제어 및 GPG 필드에 추가 정보를 입력합니다. 채널 생성을 클릭합니다. 사용자 정의 채널에는 추가 보안 설정이 필요한 경우가 있습니다. 많은 타사 벤더가 GPG로 패키지를 보호합니다. 사용자 정의 채널에서 GPG 보호 패키지를 사용하려면 메타데이터 서명에 사용된 GPG 키를 신뢰해야 합니다. 그런 다음 서명된 메타데이터가 있습니까? 확인란을 선택하여 신뢰할 수 있는 GPG 키와 패키지 메타데이터를 일치시킬 수 있습니다. 원격 채널 및 리포지토리가 GPG 키로 서명된 경우 해당 GPG 키를 임포트 및 신뢰할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, Uyuni 서버의 명령줄에서 spacewalk-repo-sync 실행: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync -c -t yum 사용할 수 있는 경우 기본 zypper 호출이 키를 임포트합니다. Web UI는 이 기능을 제공하지 않습니다. 이 기능은 미러링할 리포지토리가 특수 방식으로 설정되고 서명 옆의 리포지토리에 \"키\"를 입력하는 경우에만 작동하며, OBS(Open Build Service)에 의해 생성된 모든 리포지토리에 해당합니다. 다른 리포지토리의 경우 특별한 준비 단계가 필요합니다(아래 참조!). 기본적으로 새 채널을 생성할 때 GPG 검사 활성화 필드가 선택되어 있습니다. 채널에 사용자 정의 패키지 및 애플리케이션을 추가하려면 서명되지 않은 패키지를 설치할 수 있도록 이 필드의 선택을 취소해야 합니다. 신뢰할 수 없는 출처에서 제공된 패키지의 경우 GPG 검사를 비활성화하면 보안 위험이 발생할 수 있습니다. If you are registering traditional Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 clients you might notice errors with unsigned packages. For more information, see 기존 Red Hat 클라이언트 등록 문제 해결. 유효한 소프트웨어 리포지토리인 경우에만 Web UI를 사용하여 Uyuni에 리포지토리를 추가할 수 있습니다. 필요한 리포지토리 메타데이터를 사용할 수 있는지 미리 확인하십시오. 이와 관련해서는 createrepo 및 reprepro와 같은 도구를 유용하게 사용할 수 있습니다. mgr-push는 리포지토리를 생성하지 않고 단일 RPM을 채널에 푸시하기 위한 용도로 유용하게 사용할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 createrepo_c 및 reprepro 사용자 지정 페이지에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 소프트웨어 리포지토리 추가 Uyuni Web UI에서 소프트웨어 관리 리포지토리로 이동하고 리포지토리 생성을 클릭합니다. 리포지토리 생성 페이지에서 저장소에 레이블(예: my-tools-sles15sp1-x86_64-repo)을 지정합니다. 리포지토리 URL 필드에 repodata 파일이 포함된 디렉토리의 경로(예: file:///opt/mytools/)를 입력합니다. 이 필드에 올바른 주소 지정 프로토콜을 사용할 수 있습니다. 서명된 메타데이터가 있습니까? 확인란의 선택을 취소합니다. 선택 사항: 리포지토리에 클라이언트 인증서 인증이 필요한 경우 SSL 필드를 입력하십시오. 리포지토리 생성을 클릭합니다. 위의 절차는 미러링할 리포지토리가 서명 옆에 있는 리포지토리의 \"키\"를 제공하는 경우에만 작동합니다. OBS에 의해 생성된 모든 리포지토리의 경우가 이에 해당하지만, 일반적으로 OBS에서 제공하지 않는 운영 체제의 다른 리포지토리는 해당하지 않습니다. 사용할 리포지토리에 GPG 키가 없으면 직접 입력하고 GPG 키를 키링으로 수동으로 임포트할 수 있습니다. gpg 명령줄 도구를 사용하여 /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir 키링으로 키를 임포트하면 영구적으로 저장됩니다. 키는 chroot 환경을 삭제하는 경우에도 유지됩니다. 절차: GPG 키를 사용하여 소프트웨어 리포지토리 생성 키를 펍 키링으로 임포트하는 gpg 명령은 다음과 같습니다. gpg --keyring /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --import /path/to/gpg.key gpg --edit-key uyuni_suite, uyuni_component 및 uyuni_arch 쿼리 파라미터를 사용하여 Debian 논플랫 리포지토리를 추가합니다. uyuni_suite 필수입니다. Debian 설명서에서는 이를 배포라고도 합니다. 이 파라미터를 사용하여 적절한 소스를 지정합니다. 이 파라미터가 없으면 원래 접근 방식이 사용됩니다. 파라미터가 /로 끝나면 리포지토리가 플랫으로 식별됩니다. uyuni_component 선택 사항입니다. 이 파라미터는 하나의 구성 요소만 지정할 수 있습니다. 구성 요소를 나열할 수는 없습니다. 적절한 소스 항목을 사용하면 여러 구성 요소를 지정할 수 있지만, Uyuni의 경우에는 불가능합니다. 대신 각 구성 요소에 대해 별도의 리포지토리를 생성해야 합니다. uyuni_arch 선택 사항입니다. 생략하면 아키텍처 이름이 데이터베이스의 채널에 대한 SQL 쿼리로 계산됩니다. 채널의 아키텍처와 일치하지 않는 경우 uyuni_arch를 명시적으로 지정하십시오(아키텍처 이름이 모호한 경우도 있음). 예는 다음과 같습니다.

Web UI를 사용하여 이미지를 빌드하는 방법에는 2가지입니다. 이미지 빌드를 선택하거나 이미지 프로파일 목록에서 빌드 아이콘을 클릭합니다. 절차: 이미지 빌드 이미지 빌드를 선택합니다. 기본 최신이 아닌 다른 버전을 원하는 경우 다른 태그 이름을 추가합니다(컨테이너에만 적용됨). 이미지 프로파일 및 빌드 호스트를 선택합니다. 빌드 필드 오른쪽에 프로파일 요약이 표시됩니다. 빌드 프로필을 선택하면 선택한 프로파일에 대한 자세한 정보가 여기에 표시됩니다. 빌드를 예약하려면 빌드 버튼을 클릭합니다. 이미지 빌드 프로세스 중에 빌드 서버는 어떤 형태의 자동 마운터도 실행할 수 없습니다. 해당하는 경우, 루트 권한으로 실행 중인 Gnome 세션이 없는지 확인하십시오. 자동 마운터가 실행 중인 경우 이미지 빌드가 완료되지만, 이미지의 체크섬이 달라 실패하게 됩니다. 이미지 빌드가 성공하면 검사 단계가 시작됩니다. 검사 단계에서 SUSE Manager는 이미지에 대한 정보를 수집합니다. 이미지에 설치된 패키지 목록 이미지의 체크섬 이미지 유형 및 기타 이미지 세부 사항 빌드된 이미지 유형이 PXE인 경우 Salt 열도 생성됩니다. 이미지 열은 데이터베이스에 저장되며 Salt 하위 시스템은 생성된 이미지에 대한 세부 사항에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 세부 사항에는 이미지 파일의 위치 및 제공 위치, 이미지 체크섬, 네트워크 부팅에 필요한 정보 등이 포함됩니다. 생성된 열은 연결된 모든 클라이언트에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 이미지를 빌드하려면 여러 종속 단계가 필요합니다. 빌드가 실패하는 경우 Salt 상태 결과 및 빌드 로그를 조사하면 실패의 원인을 식별하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 빌드 실패 시 수행할 수 있는 검사: 빌드 호스트는 빌드 소스에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 빌드 호스트 및 Uyuni 서버 모두에 이미지를 위한 충분한 디스크 공간이 있습니다. 활성화 키에 연결된 올바른 채널이 있습니다. 사용된 빌드 소스가 유효합니다. Uyuni 공용 인증서가 포함된 RPM 패키지는 최신 버전이며 /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 공용 인증서 RPM을 새로 고치는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 빌드 호스트 생성에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에는 이미지 관련 작업을 할 때 알려진 몇 가지 문제가 포함되어 있습니다. HTTP 소스 또는 git 리포지토리에 액세스하기 위해 사용되는 HTTPS 인증서는 사용자 정의 상태 파일을 통해 클라이언트에 배포하거나 수동으로 구성해야 합니다. Kiwi 기반 이미지 임포트는 지원되지 않습니다. 사용할 수 있는 빌드 이미지를 나열하려면 이미지 이미지 목록를 선택하십시오. 모든 이미지 목록이 표시됩니다. 이미지에 대해 표시되는 데이터에는 이미지 이름, 버전, 리비전 및 빌드 상태가 포함됩니다. 이미지에 사용할 수 있는 가능한 패치 및 패키지 업데이트 목록을 통해 이미지 업데이트 상태를 확인할 수도 있습니다. OS 이미지의 경우 이름 및 버전 필드는 Kiwi 소스에서 제공되며 빌드가 성공적으로 완료되면 업데이트됩니다. 빌드 중 또는 빌드 실패 후, 이 필드에는 프로파일 이름을 기반으로 하는 임시 이름이 표시됩니다. 리비전은 빌드가 성공할 때마다 자동으로 증가합니다. OS 이미지의 경우 저장소에 여러 리비전이 함께 있을 수 있습니다. 컨테이너 이미지의 경우 저장소에는 최신 리비전만 보존됩니다. 이전 버전(패키지, 패치 등)에 대한 정보는 보존되며 구식 표시 확인란을 사용하여 나열할 수 있습니다. 이미지에서 자세히 버튼을 클릭하면 자세한 내용을 확인할 수 있습니다. 상세 보기에는 관련 패치의 정확한 목록, 이미지 내에 설치된 모든 패키지 목록 및 빌드 로그가 포함됩니다. 삭제 버튼을 클릭하면 목록에서 이미지가 삭제됩니다. 또한, 관련 열, OS 이미지 저장소의 파일 및 사용되지 않는 리비전도 삭제됩니다. 빌드가 성공한 후 상태를 검사한 경우에만 패치 및 패키지 목록을 사용할 수 있습니다.","title":"이미지 빌드 및 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"image-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/image-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 이미지 빌드 개요","hash":"at.images.overview","id":1},{"text":"2. 컨테이너 이미지","hash":"at.images.docker","id":2},{"text":"2.1. 요구사항","hash":"at.images.docker.requirements","id":3},{"text":"2.2. 빌드 호스트 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.buildhost","id":4},{"text":"2.3. 컨테이너에 대한 활성화 키 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.buildchannels","id":5},{"text":"2.4. 이미지 저장소 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.imagestore","id":6},{"text":"2.5. 이미지 프로파일 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.profile","id":7},{"text":"2.6. 이미지 빌드","hash":"at.images.docker.building","id":8},{"text":"2.7. 이미지 임포트","hash":"at.images.docker.importing","id":9},{"text":"2.8. 문제 해결","hash":"at.images.docker.troubleshooting","id":10},{"text":"3.

Uyuni 서버 및 프록시는 자체 상태 메트릭을 제공할 수 있습니다. 또한, Salt 클라이언트에서 여러 Prometheus 엑스포트를 설치 및 관리할 수 있습니다. Prometheus 및 Grafana 패키지가 Uyuni 클라이언트 도구에 포함된 대상은 다음과 같습니다. SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 openSUSE Leap 15.x Uyuni 서버와 별도의 시스템에 Prometheus 및 Grafana를 설치해야 합니다. 모니터링 서버로 관리되는 Salt SUSE 클라이언트를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 다른 클라이언트는 모니터링 서버로 지원되지 않습니다. Prometheus는 풀 방식을 사용하여 메트릭을 가져오므로 서버는 모니터링되는 클라이언트에 대한 TCP 연결을 설정할 수 있어야 합니다. 클라이언트에는 해당하는 열린 포트가 있어야 하며 네트워크를 통해 연결할 수 있어야 합니다. 또는, 역방향 프록시를 사용하여 연결을 설정할 수 있습니다. Prometheus는 시계열 데이터베이스에 실시간 메트릭을 기록하기 위해 사용되는 오픈 소스 모니터링 도구입니다. 메트릭은 HTTP를 통해 끌어오며, 고성능과 확장성을 가능하게 합니다. Prometheus 메트릭은 시계열 데이터 또는 동일한 그룹 또는 차원에 속하는 타임스탬프 값입니다. 메트릭은 이름과 레이블 집합으로 고유하게 식별됩니다. 메트릭 이름 레이블 타임스탬프 값 ┌────────┴───────┐ ┌───────────┴───────────┐ ┌──────┴──────┐ ┌─┴─┐ http_requests_total{status=\"200\", method=\"GET\"} @1557331801.111 42236 모니터링되는 각 애플리케이션 또는 시스템은 코드 계측 또는 Prometheus 엑스포트를 통해 위의 형식으로 메트릭을 노출해야 합니다. 엑스포트는 타사 시스템의 메트릭을 Prometheus 메트릭으로 엑스포트할 때 유용하게 사용할 수 있는 라이브러리입니다. 엑스포트는 Prometheus 메트릭을 사용하여 특정 애플리케이션 또는 시스템을 직접 계측하는 것이 불가능할 때마다 유용합니다. 모니터링되는 호스트에서 여러 엑스포트를 실행하여 로컬 메트릭을 엑스포트할 수 있습니다. Prometheus 커뮤니티는 공식 엑스포트 목록을 제공하며, 커뮤니티 기여를 통해 더욱 추가될 것입니다. 자세한 내용과 광범위한 엑스포트 목록은 https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Grafana는 데이터 시각화, 모니터링 및 분석을 위한 도구입니다. 그리고 일정 기간 동안 특정 메트릭을 나타내는 패널이 포함된 대시보드를 생성하기 위한 용도로 사용됩니다. 일반적으로 Grafana는 Prometheus와 함께 사용되지만, ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL 및 Influx DB와 같은 다른 데이터 소스도 지원합니다. Grafana에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://grafana.com/docs/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 모니터링 서버를 설정하려면 Prometheus와 Grafana를 설치 및 구성해야 합니다. 모니터링 서버가 Salt 클라이언트인 경우 Uyuni Web UI를 사용하여 Prometheus 패키지를 설치할 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않으면 모니터링 서버에 패키지를 수동으로 다운로드하여 설치할 수 있습니다. Prometheus 소프트웨어는 Uyuni 프록시 및 Uyuni for Retail 분기 서버에서도 사용할 수 있습니다. 데이터를 저장하려면 Prometheus에 POSIX 파일 시스템이 필요합니다. POSIX 호환 파일 시스템이 아닌 파일 시스템은 지원되지 않습니다. NFS 파일 시스템은 지원되지 않습니다. 절차: Web UI를 사용한 Prometheus 설치 Uyuni Web UI에서 Prometheus를 설치할 시스템의 세부 사항 페이지를 열고 수식 탭으로 이동합니다. Prometheus 확인란을 선택하여 모니터링 수식을 활성화하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 상단 메뉴의 Prometheus 탭으로 이동합니다.

Prometheus 페더레이션에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 네트워크 경계를 통해 요청을 프록시할 수도 있습니다. PushProx와 같은 도구는 네트워크 장벽의 양쪽에 프록시와 클라이언트를 배포하고 Prometheus가 NAT와 같은 네트워크 토폴로지에서 작동할 수 있도록 합니다. PushProx에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://github.com/RobustPerception/PushProx에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Prometheus는 풀 방식을 사용하여 메트릭을 가져오므로, 서버는 모니터링되는 클라이언트의 각 엑스포트에 대한 TCP 연결을 설정할 수 있어야 합니다. 방화벽 구성을 단순화하기 위해 엑스포트에 역방향 프록시를 사용하여 단일 포트의 모든 메트릭을 노출할 수 있습니다. 절차: 역방향 프록시를 사용하여 Prometheus 엑스포터 설치하기 Uyuni Web UI에서 모니터링할 시스템의 세부 사항 페이지를 열고 수식 탭으로 이동합니다. Prometheus 엑스포트 확인란을 선택하여 엑스포트 수식을 활성화하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 상단 메뉴에서 Prometheus 엑스포트 탭으로 이동합니다. 역방향 프록시 활성화 옵션을 확인하고 유효한 역방향 프록시 포트 번호를 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 9999입니다. 필요에 따라, 다른 엑스포트를 사용자 정의합니다. 수식 저장을 클릭합니다. highstate를 적용하고 성공적으로 완료되었는지 확인합니다. 수식 모니터링에 대한 자세한 내용은 Monitoring Formula에서 참조하십시오. Prometheus 서버 및 Prometheus 노드 엑스포트는 TLS 암호화 및 인증으로 엔드포인트를 보호하는 기본 제공 방법을 제공합니다. Uyuni Web UI는 관련된 모든 구성요소의 구성을 간소화합니다. TLS 인증서는 사용자가 제공하고 배포해야 합니다. Uyuni에서 지원하는 보안 모델은 다음과 같습니다. 노드 엑스포트: TLS 암호화 및 클라이언트 인증서 기반 인증 Prometheus: TLS 암호화 및 기본 인증 사용 가능한 모든 옵션 구성에 대한 자세한 내용은 Monitoring Formula에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 Uyuni는 모니터링 구성을 보호하기 위한 인증서를 제공하지 않습니다. 보안을 제공하기 위해 자체 서명되거나 타사 인증 기관(CA)에서 서명한 사용자 지정 인증서를 생성하거나 임포트할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에서는 SUSE Manager CA를 사용하여 자체 서명된 Prometheus 및 노드 엑스포트 미니언에 대한 클라이언트/서버 인증서를 생성하는 방법을 설명합니다. 절차: 서버/클라이언트 TLS 인증서 생성 Uyuni 서버의 명령 프롬프트에서 다음 명령을 실행합니다. rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-email=\"name@example.com\" \\ --set-hostname=\"minion.example.com\" --set-cname=\"minion.example.com\" --no-rpm set-cname 파라미터가 Salt 클라이언트의 FQDN(정규화된 도메인 이름)인지 확인합니다. 여러 별칭이 필요한 경우 set-cname 파라미터를 여러 번 사용할 수 있습니다. server.crt 및 server.key 파일을 Salt 미니언에 복사하고 prometheus 사용자에게 읽기 액세스 권한을 부여합니다.","title":"Prometheus 및 Grafana를 사용한 모니터링","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"monitoring","url":"/uyuni/administration/monitoring.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

SCAP(Security Content Automation Protocol)는 커뮤니티 아이디어에서 파생된 상호 운용이 가능한 사양의 종합으로, 엔터프라이즈 시스템의 시스템 보안을 유지하기 위해 NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)에서 유지보수하는 사양군입니다. SCAP는 시스템 보안을 유지하기 위한 표준화된 접근 방식을 제공하기 위해 만들어졌으며, 사용되는 표준은 커뮤니티 및 엔터프라이즈 비즈니스의 니즈를 충족하기 위해 지속적으로 변경됩니다. 일관적이고 반복 가능한 개정 작업 흐름을 제공하기 위해 신규 사양은 NIST의 SCAP 릴리스 주기에 의해 관리됩니다. 자세한 내용은 다음에서 확인할 수 있습니다. http://scap.nist.gov/timeline.html https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol https://www.open-scap.org/features/standards/ https://ncp.nist.gov/repository?scap Uyuni는 OpenSCAP를 사용하여 SCAP 사양을 구현합니다. OpenSCAP는 XCCDF(Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format)를 활용하는 감사 도구입니다. XCCDF는 검사 목록의 내용을 나타내는 표준 방식이며 보안 검사 목록을 정의합니다. 또한, CPE(Common Platform Enumeration), CCE(Common Configuration Enumeration), OVAL(Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language)과 같은 다른 사양과 결합하여 SCAP 인증 제품에서 처리할 수 있는 SCAP로 표시되는 검사 목록을 생성합니다. OpenSCAP는 SUSE 보안 팀에서 생성한 컨텐트를 사용하여 패치가 있는지 확인합니다. OpenSCAP은 시스템 보안 구성 설정을 확인하고 표준 및 사양에 기반한 규칙을 활용하여 시스템의 손상 징후를 검사합니다. SUSE 보안 팀에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://www.suse.com/support/security를 참조하십시오. 시작하기 전, SCAP 스캔을 위해 클라이언트 시스템을 준비해야 합니다. SSH 연락 방법을 사용하는 Salt 클라이언트에서는 OpenSCAP 감사를 사용할 수 없습니다. 스캔 클라이언트는 스캔이 수행 중인 클라이언트에서 대규모의 메모리와 컴퓨팅 파워를 소모할 수 있습니다. Red Hat 클라이언트의 경우 스캔할 각 클라이언트에서 최소 2 GB의 RAM을 사용할 수 있어야 합니다. 기존 및 Salt 클라이언트의 경우, 시작하기 전 OpenSCAP 스캐너 및 SCAP 보안 가이드(컨텐트) 패키지를 설치해야 합니다. 운영 체제에 따라 이러한 패키지는 기본 운영 체제 또는 Uyuni 클라이언트 도구에 포함됩니다. 아래 테이블에는 클라이언트 운영 체제에 따라 필요한 패키지가 나열되어 있습니다. Table 1. OpenSCAP 패키지 운영 체제 스캐너 컨텐트 SLES openscap-utils scap-security-guide openSUSE openscap-utils scap-security-guide RHEL openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat CentOS openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Oracle Linux openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Ubuntu libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-ubuntu Debian libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-debian RHEL 7 및 호환 시스템은 오래된 컨텐트가 포함된 scap-security-guide 패키지를 제공합니다. Uyuni 클라이언트 도구에 포함된 scap-security-guide-redhat 패키지를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. SUSE는 다양한 openscap 프로파일에 대한 scap-security-guide 패키지를 제공합니다. scap-security-guide의 현재 버전에서 SUSE가 지원하는 프로파일: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 DISA STIG 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 PCI-DSS 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 HIPAA 프로파일 CIS 프로파일과 같은 다른 프로파일은 커뮤니티에서 제공하며 SUSE에서는 공식적으로 지원하지 않습니다. 비SUSE 운영 체제의 경우 포함된 프로파일은 커뮤니티에서 제공하는 프로파일입니다. SUSE에서는 공식적으로 지원하지 않습니다. OpenSCAP는 SCAP 컨텐트 파일을 사용하여 테스트 규칙을 정의합니다. 이러한 컨텐트 파일은 XCCDF 또는 OVAL 표준을 기반으로 생성됩니다. SCAP 보안 가이드뿐만 아니라 공개적으로 사용할 수 있는 컨텐트 파일을 다운로드하고 요구사항에 따라 사용자 정의할 수 있습니다. 그리고 기본 컨텐트 파일 템플릿용 SCAP 보안 가이드 패키지를 설치할 수 있습니다. 또는 XCCDF 또는 OVAL에 익숙한 경우 자체 컨텐트 파일을 생성할 수 있습니다. 템플릿을 사용하여 SCAP 컨텐트 파일을 생성하는 것이 권장됩니다. 자체 사용자 정의 컨텐트 파일을 생성 및 사용하는 경우 자신이 모든 위험을 감수해야 합니다. 사용자 정의 컨텐트 파일을 사용하여 시스템이 손상된 경우 SUSE에서 지원하지 않을 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 파일을 생성한 후에는 해당 파일을 클라이언트로 전송해야 합니다. 물리적 저장 매체를 사용하거나 Salt(예: salt-cp 또는 Salt File Server), ftp 또는 scp를 사용하여 네트워크를 통해 다른 파일을 이동할 때와 동일한 방식으로 이 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. Uyuni로 관리하는 클라이언트에 컨텐트 파일을 배포하는 패키지를 생성하는 것이 권장됩니다. 무결성을 보장하기 위해 패키지가 서명 및 검증될 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 사용자 정의 채널에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 운영 체제에 따라 다양한 OpenSCAP 컨텐트 파일 및 프로파일을 사용할 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 파일 한 개에는 프로파일이 두 개 이상 포함될 수 있습니다. RPM 기반 운영 체제에서 다음 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 SCAP 파일의 위치를 확인합니다. rpm -ql DEB 기반 운영 체제에서 다음 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 SCAP 파일의 위치를 확인합니다. dpkg -L 요구사항에 적합한 SCAP 컨텐트 파일 한 개를 찾은 경우 클라이언트에서 사용 가능한 프로필을 나열합니다. oscap info ./usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml Document type: Source Data Stream Imported: 2021-03-24T18:14:45 Stream: scap_org.open-scap_datastream_from_xccdf_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml Generated: (null) Version: 1.2 Checklists: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml Status: draft Generated: 2021-03-24 Resolved: true Profiles: Title: CIS SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Benchmark Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis Title: Standard System Security Profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard Title: DISA STIG for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig Referenced check files: ssg-sle15-oval.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 ssg-sle15-ocil.xml system: http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2 https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/suse.linux.enterprise.15.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 Checks: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-oval.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-ocil.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-oval.xml Dictionaries: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-dictionary.xml 스캔을 수행하기 위한 파일 경로 및 프로파일을 기록해 둡니다. 컨텐트 파일을 설치 또는 전송하면 감사 스캔을 수행할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI를 사용하여 감사 스캔을 트리거할 수 있습니다. Uyuni API를 사용하여 정기 검사를 예약할 수도 있습니다. 절차: Web UI에서 감사 스캔 실행 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 시스템 목록으로 이동하여 스캔할 클라이언트를 선택합니다. 감사 탭으로 이동하여 일정 하위 탭으로 이동합니다. XCCDF 문서 경로 필드에 클라이언트에서 사용할 SCAP 템플릿 및 프로파일에 대한 파라미터를 입력합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. Command: /usr/bin/oscap xccdf eval Command-line arguments: --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig Path to XCCDF document: /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml If you use --fetch-remote-resources parameter a lot of RAM is required. In addition, you may need to increase the value of file_recv_max_size. 스캔은 클라이언트의 다음번에 예약된 동기화 시 실행됩니다. XCCDF 컨텐트 파일은 유효성을 검사한 후 원격 시스템에서 실행됩니다. 컨텐트 파일에 잘못된 인수가 포함되면 테스트가 실패합니다. 절차: API에서 감사 스캔 실행 시작하기 전, 스캔할 클라이언트에 Python 및 XML-RPC 라이브러리가 설치되어 있는지 확인합니다. 기존 스크립트를 선택하거나 system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan을 통해 시스템 검사를 예약하기 위한 스크립트를 생성합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. #!/usr/bin/python client = xmlrpclib.Server('https://server.example.com/rpc/api') key = client.auth.login('username', 'password') client.system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan(key, , '', '--profile ') 이 예에서: * 은 시스템 ID(sid)입니다. * 은 클라이언트의 컨텐트 파일 위치에 대한 경로입니다. 예를 들어, /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml입니다. * 은 oscap 명령에 대한 추가 인수입니다. 예를 들어, united_states_government_configuration_baseline(USGCB)을 사용합니다. 명령 프롬프트에서, 스캔할 클라이언트의 스크립트를 실행합니다. 실행한 검사에 대한 정보는 Uyuni Web UI에 있습니다. 결과 테이블을 확인하려면 감사 OpenSCAP 모든 스캔으로 이동합니다. 이 테이블의 데이터에 대한 자세한 내용은 All Scans에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 스캔에 대한 자세한 정보를 사용하려면 클라이언트에서 활성화해야 합니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 관리자 조직으로 이동하고 클라이언트가 속한 조직을 클릭합니다. 구성 탭으로 이동하여 자세한 SCAP 파일 업로드 활성화 옵션을 선택합니다. 활성화하면, 모든 스캔에서 자세한 정보가 포함된 추가 HTML 파일이 생성됩니다. 결과에는 다음과 유사한 추가 라인이 표시됩니다. 자세한 결과: xccdf-report.html xccdf-results.xml scap-yast2sec-oval.xml.result.xml 명령줄에서 스캔 정보를 검색하려면 spacewalk-report 명령을 사용합니다. spacewalk-report system-history-scap spacewalk-report scap-scan spacewalk-report scap-scan-results Uyuni API를 사용하여 system.scap 핸들러로 결과를 확인할 수도 있습니다. 클라이언트 시스템을 강화하기 위해 수정 bash 스크립트와 Ansible 플레이북이 동일한 SCAP 보안 가이드 패키지에 제공됩니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다.

SUSE는 권고 상태를 (\"최종\" 또는 \"안정\" 대신) \"철회\"로 설정하여 이러한 패치를 거의 즉시 취소하는 \"철회된 패치\"라는 새로운 메커니즘(2021년)을 도입했습니다. 패치의 권고 상태 특성이 \"철회\"로 설정되면 패치가 \"철회\"됩니다. 패키지는 \"철회된\" 패치에 속하는 경우 \"철회\"됩니다. 철회된 패치 또는 패키지는 Uyuni가 설치된 시스템에 설치할 수 없습니다. 철회된 패키지를 설치하는 유일한 방법은 zypper install을 사용하여 수동으로 설치하고 정확한 패키지 버전을 지정하는 것입니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. zypper install vim-8.0.1568-5.14.1 패치 및 패키지의 철회 상태는 Uyuni의 Web UI에 아이콘으로 표시됩니다. 다음 예시를 참조할 수 있습니다. 채널 내 패키지 목록 채널 내 패치 목록 시스템에 설치된 패치 또는 패키지가 철회되면 해당 시스템의 설치된 패키지 목록에 아이콘도 표시됩니다. Uyuni는 이러한 패치 또는 패키지를 다운그레이드할 수 있는 방법을 제공하지 않습니다. 복제된 채널을 사용하는 경우에는 철회된 권고 상태가 원래 채널에서 클론으로 전파되는 것에 주의해야 합니다. 벤더 채널을 조직에 복제하면 채널 패치도 복제됩니다. 벤더가 채널의 패치를 철회하고 Uyuni가 이 채널을 동기화하면(예: 야간 작업을 통해), \"철회됨\" 특성은 복제된 패치로 전파되지 않으며 복제된 채널에 가입한 클라이언트에게 표시되지 않습니다. 복제된 채널에 특성을 전파하려면 다음 방법을 사용할 수 있습니다. 패치 동기화(메뉴:소프트웨어[관리 > 복제된 채널 > 패치 > 동기화]). 이 기능을 사용하면 복제된 채널의 패치 특성을 원본에 맞출 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리의 컨텍스트에서 복제된 채널에 대한 자세한 내용은 소프트웨어 채널에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 조직에서 여러 벤더 채널 클론을 생성하면 패치가 여러 번 복제되지 않고 복제된 채널 간에 공유됩니다. 결과적으로 복제된 패치를 동기화할 때(패치 동기화 기능을 사용하거나 위에서 언급한 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리를 사용하여) 복제된 패치를 사용하는 모든 채널이 해당 변경사항을 따르게 됩니다. 예: 두 개의 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리 프로젝트 prj1 및 prj2를 생각해 보겠습니다. 이 두 프로젝트에는 dev 및 test의 두 가지 환경이 있습니다. 이러한 두 프로젝트에는 벤더 채널이 소스 채널로 설정되어 있습니다. 이 시나리오의 모든 채널(복제된 채널 총 네 개)은 벤더 채널의 최신 상태에 맞춰 정렬됩니다. 벤더는 소스 채널에서 패치를 철회하고 야간 작업 중에 Uyuni에 동기화합니다. 채널 네 개 모두 패치 클론을 사용하고 패치를 직접 사용하지 않으므로 이 변경사항을 볼 수 없습니다. 패치를 동기화하는 즉시(이러한 두 프로젝트 중 한 개를 빌드하거나 네 개의 복제된 채널에서 패치 동기화 기능을 사용), 패치 공유로 인해 복제된 채널 모두 패치가 철회된 것으로 표시됩니다.","title":"패치 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"patch-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/patch-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 철회된 패치","hash":"_철회된_패치","id":1},{"text":"1.1. 채널 클론","hash":"_채널_클론","id":2},{"text":"1.2. 패치 공유","hash":"_패치_공유","id":3}]},"36":{"id":36,"text":"Table of Contents 1. Understanding PTF packages 2. Installing PTF packages 3. After PTF installation 4. Removing the patched version of a package 5. Removing the patched version of a package on the client SUSE provides temporary fixes for all currently supported solutions shipped directly to its customers. These PTFs (Program Temporary Fixes) are now available as repositories, which can be synced in Uyuni. PTF packages are installed via a proxy package and are named ptf-xxxxxx, where xxxxxx is a number and part of the name of the package, not its version. They will depend on the correct version of the package that is known to include the correction in the software. This type of package: cannot be installed accidentally (i.e. zypper update will never suggest installing them), cannot be removed accidentally (i.e. a newer package version will not replace the PTF one, unless the user makes it explicitly on the zypper command line), is only updated when the newer version is known to address the specific issue previously solved by the PTF, updates only packages already installed on the system (i.e. if a software is split into multiple packages, the PTF will replace only those currently installed on the system). The correct ID of the package will be provided by SUSE Support during the course of the support case investigation, along with instruction on how to deploy/restart the affected services. PTF packages are currently only supported for SLE 12 and SLE 15 based systems. Other versions or Operating Systems do not have this feature yet and the pages are not visible for them. Procedure: Enable and Synchronize PTF repositories using the command line On the console enter mgr-sync refresh. Enter mgr-sync list channel and look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. E.g. a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Enable the PTF channel with mgr-sync add channel . Now this channel is available and can be added to every system which is using the same base channel. PTF packages need to be installed explicitly, since they are not automatically picked up when updating a system. The SUSE Customer Support will provide the PTF number to fix a specific problem. With the number the proxy package can be identified in the PTF list. In Uyuni Web UI every system with PTFs available for installation has a page which lists them. Procedure: Enable and Synchronize PTF repositories via the Uyuni Web UI In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Products and look for the product you want to enable the PTF repository for. Click Show product’s channels next to the products sync status. You should see a popup listing mandatory and optional channels for the product. In the optional channels list look for channels starting with your SCC account name and ptfs in its name. E.g. a123456-sles-15.3-ptfs-x86_64. Select the channel using the checkbox next to its name and click Confirm to schedule the sync. Note that the product has to be installed to be able to add optional channels to it. Procedure: Installation of PTF packages In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client where you want to install a PTF. Navigate to the Systems Software Packages Software Channels and select the PTF channel. 다음을 클릭한 후 소프트웨어 채널 변경 확인을 클릭하여 확인합니다. To check if the channel assignment is finished, navigate to Systems Events History to see the results. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs Install sub tab. Select the ptf package you want to install. Click Install PTF, and Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Installation with Confirm. To see PTF installation results, navigate to Systems Events History. In case a PTF should be installed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageInstall API can be used with the proxy package name. Once a PTF is confirmed to address the reported issue, the updated package will be tracked for inclusion into a future maintenance update before being widely distributed as an regular maintenance update in the update repositories. When this regular update with the fix is released, an updated version of the PTF will also be released into the account-specific PTF repository. The updated PTF will remove the strict dependencies and allow updates to be installed again. The replacement of the PTF with the maintenance update which includes the fix happens automatically via a standard package update or patch installation. In cases where a PTF needs to be uninstalled and the non-patched version of the packages need to be installed on the system, a simple package remove cannot be used. The ptf package is not selectable in the standard package list page. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client you want to remove a PTF from. Navigate to the Systems Software PTFs List/Remove sub tab. Select the ptf package you want to remove. Click Remove PTFs, and on the Confirm Program Temporary Fixes (PTFs) Removal page click Confirm. To see the results, navigate to Systems Events History. Removing PTFs requires a special version of libzypp and zypper to be installed on the client system. Check zypper --help whether removeptf is supported. The List/Remove tab is only visible if this condition is met. In case the PTF should be removed using the API, the normal system.schedulePackageRemove api can be used with the proxy package name. In case a PTF should be removed directly on the client using the console, it is required to use a special command zypper removeptf …​. All other ways result either in an error or can lead to unwanted behavior like removing important packages from the system and make the system unusable.

SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 클라이언트는 서버 인증서의 호스트 이름이 필요한 이름과 일치하는지 확인합니다. 클라이언트는 또한 서버 인증서가 신뢰할 수 있는지 확인해야 합니다. 인증 기관(CA)은 다른 인증서에 서명하기 위해 사용되는 인증서입니다. 모든 인증서는 인증 기관(CA)에서 서명해야 유효한 것으로 간주되며 클라이언트가 인증서에 대해 일치시킬 수 있습니다. SSL 인증이 올바르게 작동하려면 클라이언트가 루트 CA를 신뢰해야 합니다. 즉, 루트 CA가 모든 클라이언트에 설치되어야 합니다. SSL 인증의 기본 방법은 Uyuni가 자체 서명 인증서를 사용하는 것입니다. 이 경우 Uyuni가 모든 인증서를 생성했으며 루트 CA가 서버 인증서에 직접 서명합니다. 중간 CA를 사용하는 방법도 있습니다. 이 경우 루트 CA는 중간 CA에 서명합니다. 그런 다음 중간 CA는 원하는 수의 다른 중간 CA에 서명할 수 있으며 마지막 CA는 서버 인증서에 서명합니다. 이를 체인 인증서라고 합니다. 연결된 인증서에서 중간 CA를 사용하는 경우, 루트 CA는 클라이언트에 설치되고 서버 인증서는 서버에 설치됩니다. SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 클라이언트는 루트 CA와 서버 인증서 사이의 전체 중간 인증서 체인을 확인할 수 있어야 하므로, 모든 중간 인증서에 액세스할 수 있어야 합니다. 이를 달성하는 두 가지 주요 방법이 있습니다. 이전 버전의 Uyuni에서는 기본적으로 모든 중간 CA가 클라이언트에 설치됩니다. 그러나 서버에서 서비스를 구성하여 클라이언트에 제공할 수도 있습니다. 이 경우 SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 서버는 서버 인증서와 모든 중간 CA를 제공합니다. 이제 이 메커니즘이 새로운 기본 구성으로 사용됩니다. 기본적으로 Uyuni는 중간 CA 없이 자체 서명 인증서를 사용합니다. 추가 보안을 위해 인증서에 서명하도록 타사 CA를 지정할 수 있습니다. 타사 CA는 인증서에 검사를 수행하여 포함된 정보가 올바른지 확인합니다. 그리고 일반적으로 이 서비스에 대해 연간 요금을 청구합니다. 타사 CA를 사용하면 인증서를 스푸핑하기 더 어렵고 설치에 대한 추가 보호가 제공됩니다. 타사 CA에서 서명한 인증서가 있는 경우 Uyuni 설치로 임포트할 수 있습니다. 이 설명서에서는 SSL 인증서 사용을 2단계로 설명합니다.

Uyuni에서 활성화 키는 레이블이 있는 구성 설정 그룹입니다. 레이블을 부트스트랩 스크립트에 파라미터로 추가하여 활성화 키와 연결된 모든 구성 설정을 적용할 수 있습니다. 활성화 키 레이블을 부트스트랩 스크립트와 함께 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 부트스트랩 스크립트가 실행될 때 레이블에 연결된 모든 구성 설정은 스크립트가 실행되는 시스템에 적용됩니다. 활성화 키는 다음을 지정할 수 있습니다. 채널 할당 시스템 유형 또는 추가 자격 연락 방법 구성 파일 설치할 패키지 시스템 그룹 할당 활성화 키는 클라이언트 등록 시 사용되며 다시 사용되지 않습니다. 클라이언트는 등록된 후에 지정된 활성화 키와 관계없이 변경할 수 있습니다. 활성화 키와 클라이언트 사이의 관계는 기록 목적으로만 기록됩니다. 절차: 활성화 키 생성 Uyuni Web UI에서 관리자 권한으로 시스템 활성화 키로 이동합니다. 키 생성 버튼을 클릭합니다. 활성화 키 상세 정보 페이지의 설명 필드에 활성화 키의 설명을 입력합니다. 키 필드에 활성화 키의 이름을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4에 대해서는 SLES15-SP4를 입력합니다. SUSE 제품인 경우 키 필드에 쉼표를 사용하지 마십시오. 하지만 Red Hat 제품인 경우 반드시 쉼표를 사용해야 합니다. 기타 모든 문자는 허용되지만 <> (){}(공백 포함)는 자동으로 제거됩니다. 필드가 비어 있으면 임의의 스트링이 생성됩니다. 기본 채널 드롭다운 상자에서 적절한 기본 소프트웨어 채널을 선택하고, 관련 하위 채널이 작성되도록 허용합니다. 자세한 내용은 reference:admin/setup-wizard.adoc#vle.webui.admin.wizard.products 및 사용자 정의 채널를 참조하십시오. 필요한 하위 채널을 선택합니다(예: 필수 SUSE Manager 도구 및 업데이트 채널). 옵션을 활성화하려면 추가 시스템 유형 확인란을 선택합니다. 연결 방법은 기본값으로 설정된 상태 그대로 두는 것이 좋습니다. 범용 기본값 설정은 확인란이 선택되지 않은 상태 그대로 두는 것이 좋습니다. 활성화 키 생성을 클릭하여 활성화 키를 생성합니다. 구성 파일 배포 확인란을 선택하여 이 키에 대한 구성 관리를 활성화하고, 활성화 키 업데이트를 클릭하여 이 변경 사항을 저장합니다. 구성 파일 배포 확인란은 활성화 키를 생성한 후에야 표시됩니다. 구성 관리를 활성화해야 하는 경우 되돌아가 확인란을 선택하십시오. 기존 클라이언트에서 부트스트랩 스크립트를 실행할 때 활성화 키를 결합할 수 있습니다. 키를 결합하면 시스템에서 설치된 것에 대해 더 많은 제어권을 확보할 수 있고 규모가 크거나 복잡한 환경에서 키가 중복되는 일이 줄어듭니다. 활성화 키 결합은 기존 클라이언트에서만 작동합니다. Salt 클라이언트는 결합된 활성화 키를 지원하지 않습니다. Salt 클라이언트에서 결합된 키를 사용하는 경우 첫 번째 키만 사용됩니다. 명령 프롬프트나 단일 자동 설치 프로파일에서 여러 개의 활성화 키를 지정할 수 있습니다. Uyuni 서버의 명령 프롬프트에서 rhnreg_ks 명령을 사용하고, 키 이름을 쉼표로 구분하십시오. Kickstart 프로파일에서 여러 개의 키를 지정하려면 시스템 자동 설치로 이동하여 사용하려는 프로파일을 편집하십시오. 일부 값들 사이의 충돌로 인해 클라이언트 등록이 실패할 수 있으므로 활성화 키를 결합할 때 주의하십시오. 시작하기 전에 다음 값에 서로 충돌하는 정보가 있는지 확인하십시오. 소프트웨어 패키지 소프트웨어 하위 채널 구성 채널 충돌이 감지되면 다음과 같이 처리됩니다. 기본 소프트웨어 채널의 충돌: 등록에 실패합니다. 시스템 유형의 충돌: 등록에 실패합니다. 구성 활성화 플래그의 충돌: 구성 관리가 활성화됩니다. 한 개의 키가 시스템 전용인 경우: 등록에 실패합니다. 클라이언트를 다시 등록하고 모든 Uyuni 설정을 다시 확보하기 위한 목적으로 재활성화 키를 한 번만 사용할 수 있습니다. 재활성화 키는 클라이언트 전용이며 시스템 ID, 이력, 그룹 및 채널을 포함합니다. 재활성화 키를 생성하려면 시스템으로 이동한 후 클라이언트를 클릭하여 재활성화 키를 생성하고, 상세 정보 재활성 탭으로 이동하십시오. 새 키 생성을 클릭하여 재활성화 키를 생성합니다. 나중에 사용할 수 있도록 키의 상세 정보를 기록해 둡니다. 특정 시스템 ID와 연결되지 않은 일반적인 활성화 키와 달리 여기에서 생성한 키는 시스템 활성화 키 페이지에 표시되지 않습니다. Salt 클라이언트의 경우 재활성화 키를 생성한 후 이 키를 management_key /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf에서 입자로 사용할 수 있습니다. 예: grains: susemanager: management_key: \"re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e\" 재활성화 키를 적용하려면 salt-minion 프로세스를 다시 시작하십시오. 재활성화 키를 부트스트랩 스크립트와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다. 부트스트랩 스크립트에 대한 자세한 내용은 부트스트랩 스크립트로 클라이언트 등록을 참조하십시오. 기존 클라이언트의 경우 재활성화 키를 생성한 후 이 키를 rhnreg_ks 명령줄 유틸리티와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 명령은 클라이언트를 다시 등록하고 Uyuni 설정을 복원합니다. 기존 클라이언트에서는 재활성화 키를 활성화 키와 결합하여 단일 시스템 프로파일에 대해 여러 키의 설정을 집계할 수 있습니다. 예: rhnreg_ks --server=/XMLRPC \\ --activationkey=, \\ --force 클라이언트를 기존 Uyuni 프로파일과 함께 자동 설치하는 경우 프로파일은 재활성화 키를 사용해 시스템을 다시 등록하고 설정을 복원합니다. 프로파일 기반 자동 설치가 진행 중일 때는 이 키를 재생성, 삭제 또는 사용하지 마십시오. 그러면 자동 설치에 실패하게 됩니다. 기본 상위 채널 SUSE Manager 기본값 상위 채널을 사용하지 마십시오. 이 설정은 Uyuni가 설치된 운영 체제와 가장 부합하는 상위 채널을 선택하도록 강제합니다. 이로 인해 때로 예기치 않은 동작이 발생할 수 있습니다. 대신에 각 배포 및 아키텍처별로 활성화 키를 생성하는 것이 좋습니다. 활성화 키를 이용한 부트스트래핑 부트스트랩 스크립트를 사용 중인 경우 각 스크립트에 대해 활성화 키를 생성하는 것을 고려하십시오. 이렇게 하면 채널 할당, 패키지 설치, 시스템 그룹 구성원, 구성 채널 할당을 조정하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 또한 등록 후 시스템에 대한 수동 개입이 덜 필요합니다. 대역폭 요구사항 활성화 키를 사용하면 등록 시점에 소프트웨어가 자동으로 다운로드될 수 있는데, 대역폭이 제한된 환경에서는 바람직하지 않을 수 있습니다. 이러한 옵션은 대역폭 사용량을 생성합니다. SUSE 제품 풀 채널을 할당하면 해당 제품 설명자 패키지가 자동으로 설치됩니다. 섹션의 모든 패키지가 Packages 설치됩니다. 구성 섹션의 모든 Salt 상태가 그 내용에 따라 다운로드를 트리거할 수 있습니다. 키 레이블 명명 활성화 키에 대해 읽을 수 있는 이름을 입력하지 않으면 시스템이 수 스트링을 자동으로 생성하므로 키를 관리하기 어려울 수 있습니다. 키를 추적하는 데 도움이 되는 활성화 키 명명 스키마를 고려하십시오. 조직의 인프라와 관련이 있는 이름을 생성하면 더 복잡한 작업을 더 쉽게 수행할 수 있습니다. 키 레이블을 생성할 때 다음과 같은 팁을 참고하십시오. OS 명명(필수): 키는 항상 자신이 설정을 제공하는 대상인 OS를 참조해야 합니다. 아키텍처 명명(권장): 귀사가 단 하나의 아키텍처(예: x86_64)만 운영하고 있지 않다면 레이블에 아키텍처 유형을 제공하는 것이 좋습니다. 서버 유형 명명: 이 서버를 어떤 목적으로 사용 중입니까? 위치 명명: 서버가 어디에 있습니까? 서버룸, 건물 또는 부서 내? 날짜 명명: 유지보수 기간, 분기 등 사용자 정의 명명: 어떤 명명 스키마가 조직의 필요에 적합합니까? 활성화 키 레이블 이름의 예: sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le 포함된 채널 활성화 키를 생성할 때는 어떤 소프트웨어 채널이 연결되어 있는지도 기억해 두어야 합니다. 키에는 할당된 특정 기본 채널이 있어야 합니다. 기본값으로 설정된 기본 채널은 사용하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 설치하려는 클라이언트 운영 체제를 참조하십시오.","title":"활성화 키","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"activation-keys","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/activation-keys.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 여러 활성화 키 결합","hash":"_여러_활성화_키_결합","id":1},{"text":"2. 활성화 키","hash":"_활성화_키","id":2},{"text":"3. 활성화 키 모범 사례","hash":"_활성화_키_모범_사례","id":3}]},"49":{"id":49,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

KIWI는 이미지 생성 시스템입니다. KIWI를 사용하여 SUSE 시스템을 설치하기 위한 대상 시스템에서 사용되는 부팅 가능한 ISO 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다. 시스템은 재부팅되거나 켜질 때 이 이미지로 부팅되고, Uyuni에서 AutoYaST 구성을 로드하며, AutoYaST 프로파일에 따라 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server를 설치합니다. ISO 이미지를 사용하려면 시스템을 부팅하고 프롬프트에 autoyast를 입력하십시오(AutoYaST 부팅을 위한 레이블을 autoyast 상태로 두었다고 가정함). Enter 키를 눌러 AutoYaST 설치를 시작합니다. KIWI에 대한 자세한 정보는 http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/에서 참조하십시오. mkisofs를 사용하여 Red Hat 시스템을 설치하기 위한 대상 시스템에서 사용되는 부팅 가능한 ISO 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다. 시스템은 재부팅되거나 켜질 때 이 이미지로 부팅되고, Uyuni에서 Kickstart 구성을 로드하며, Kickstart 프로파일에 따라 Red Hat Enterprise Linux를 설치합니다. 절차: mkisofs를 사용한 부팅 가능한 ISO 빌드 대상 배포의 첫 CD-ROM에서 /isolinux의 내용을 복사합니다. isolinux.cfg 파일을 편집하여 기본값을 ‘ks’로 설정합니다. ‘ks’ 섹션을 다음과 같이 변경합니다. label ks kernel vmlinuz append text ks=`url` initrd=initrd.img lang= devfs=nomount \\ ramdisk_size=16438 `ksdevice` IP 주소 기반 Kickstart URL은 다음과 같습니다. http://`my.manager.server`/kickstart/ks/mode/ip_range IP 범위를 통해 정의되는 Kickstart 배포는 오류 발생을 방지하기 위해 현재 빌드 중인 것에서 배포하는 것과 일치해야 합니다. 옵션: ksdevice를 사용하려면 다음과 같아야 합니다. ksdevice=eth0 새로운 배포 레이블을 지정하여 패밀리 내에서 Kickstart 프로파일에 대한 배포를 변경할 수 있습니다(예: Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 4에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 4로 변경). 버전 간(4에서 5로) 또는 업데이트 간(U1에서 U2로) 변경은 불가능하다는 점에 유의하십시오. 필요에 따라 isolinux.cfg를 보다 세부적으로 사용자 정의합니다. 예를 들어, 여러 옵션, 다양한 부팅 메시지 또는 더 짧은 시간 제한 기간을 추가할 수 있습니다. 다음 명령으로 ISO를 생성합니다. mkisofs -o file.iso -b isolinux.bin -c boot.cat -no-emul-boot \\ -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -R -J -v -T isolinux/ isolinux/는 배포 CD에서 복사되는 수정된 isolinux 파일을 포함하는 디렉토리의 상대 경로이고, file.iso는 현재 디렉토리에 배치되는 출력 ISO 파일입니다.

Kickstart에 대한 자세한 설명은 Red Hat 문서를 참조하십시오. 설치 파일의 일부는 설치 중에 대체됩니다. 변수는 단일 값으로 대체되며 코드 조각은 텍스트의 전체 섹션으로 대체됩니다. 이스케이프된 기호 또는 섹션은 대체되지 않습니다. Cheetah라는 템플릿 엔진을 사용하면 Cobbler가 해당 대체를 수행할 수 있습니다. 이 방식을 통해 각각에 대한 프로파일을 수동으로 생성할 필요 없이 대량의 시스템을 다시 설치할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 자동 설치 변수 및 코드 조각을 생성할 수 있습니다. 프로파일의 자동 설치 파일 탭을 사용하면 대체 결과를 확인할 수 있습니다. 변수에 대한 설명은 변수를 참조하십시오. 코드 조각에 대한 설명은 코드 조각을 참조하십시오. 이스케이프 기호 또는 전체 섹션에 대한 설명은 이스케이핑을 참조하십시오. 자동 설치 변수를 사용해 값을 Kickstart 및 AutoYaST 프로파일로 대신할 수 있습니다. 변수를 정의하려면 프로파일에서 변수 하위 탭으로 이동하여 텍스트 상자에서 name=value 쌍을 생성합니다. 예를 들어, 클라이언트의 IP 주소를 가진 변수와 게이트웨이의 주소를 가진 변수를 생성할 수 있습니다. 그러면 이러한 변수를 동일한 프로파일에서 설치된 모든 클라이언트에 대해 정의할 수 있습니다. 이 작업을 수행하려면 변수 텍스트 상자에 다음 줄을 추가합니다. ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 변수를 사용하려면 프로파일에서 $ 기호를 앞에 추가하여 변수를 대체합니다. 예를 들어, Kickstart 파일의 네트워크 부분은 다음과 같습니다. network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway $ipaddr은 192.168.0.28로, $gateway는 192.168.0.1로 확인됩니다. 설치 파일에서 변수는 계층 구조를 사용합니다. 시스템 변수는 프로파일 변수에 우선하고, 프로파일 변수는 배포 변수에 우선합니다. Uyuni는 미리 정의된 다양한 코드 조각과 함께 제공됩니다. 시스템 자동 설치 자동 설치 조각으로 이동하여 기존 조각의 목록을 확인합니다. 자동 설치 파일에 $SNIPPET() 매크로를 삽입하여 코드 조각을 사용합니다. 예를 들어 Kickstart에서는 다음과 같습니다. $SNIPPET('spacewalk/rhel_register_script') 또는 AutoYaST에서는 다음과 같습니다. $SNIPPET('spacewalk/sles_register_script') 매크로는 Cobbler로 구문 분석되고 코드 조각의 컨텐트로 대체됩니다. 또한 나중에 자동 설치 파일에서 사용할 자체 코드 조각을 저장할 수 있습니다. 조각 생성을 클릭하여 새 코드 조각을 생성합니다. 다음 예에서는 일반 하드 드라이브 파티션 구성에 대한 Kickstart 코드 조각을 다음과 같이 설정합니다. clearpart --all part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary part swap --recommended part pv.00 --size=1 --grow volgroup vg00 pv.00 logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000 예를 들어 다음과 같이 코드 조각을 사용합니다. $SNIPPET('my_partition') 자동 설치 파일에 $(example)와(과) 같은 셸 스크립트 변수가 포함된 경우 백슬래시를 사용하여 컨텐트를 이스케이프해야 합니다. \\$(example). $ 기호를 이스케이프하면 템플릿 엔진이 기호를 내부 변수로 평가하지 못하게 됩니다. 긴 스크립트 또는 문자열은 \\#raw 및 \\#end 지시어로 래핑하여 이스케이프할 수 있습니다. 예: #raw #!/bin/bash for i in {0..2}; do echo \"$i - Hello World!\" done #end raw # 기호 다음에 공백이 있는 모든 줄은 주석으로 취급되므로 평가되지 않습니다. 예: # 특정 섹션 시작(주석임) echo \"Hello, world\" # 특정 섹션 종료(주석임)","title":"자동 설치 프로파일","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-profiles","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-profiles.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 프로파일 선언","hash":"declare-profile","id":1},{"text":"2.

SUSE Linux Enterprise 클라이언트의 Unified Installer 업데이트 채널 채널은 소프트웨어 패키지를 그룹화하는 방법입니다. 소프트웨어 패키지는 리포지토리가 제공하며, 리포지토리는 채널과 연결되어 있습니다. 클라이언트를 소프트웨어 채널에 가입하면 클라이언트는 자신과 연결된 모든 소프트웨어를 설치하고 업데이트할 수 있습니다. Uyuni에서 채널은 기본 채널과 하위 채널로 구분됩니다. 이런 식으로 채널을 구성하면 호환되는 패키지만 각 시스템에 설치됩니다. 클라이언트는 등록 중에 클라이언트 운영 체제 및 아키텍처에 따라 할당된 하나의 기본 채널에만 가입되어야 합니다. 벤더가 제공하는 유료 채널에 대해서는 연결된 구독이 있어야 합니다. 기본 채널은 특정 운영 체제 유형, 버전 및 아키텍처를 위해 구축된 패키지로 구성됩니다. 예를 들어 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86-64 기본 채널에는 이 운영 체제 및 아키텍처와 호환되는 소프트웨어만 포함되어 있습니다. 하위 채널은 기본 채널과 연결되어 있으며 기본 채널과 호환되는 패키지만 제공합니다. 시스템은 기본 채널의 여러 하위 채널에 가입할 수 있습니다. 시스템이 기본 채널에 할당된 경우 해당 시스템은 관련 하위 채널만 설치할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 시스템에 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 x86_64 기본 채널이 할당된 경우 호환되는 기본 채널이나 기본 채널과 연결된 하위 채널 중 하나를 통해 사용할 수 있는 패키지만 설치하거나 업데이트할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 소프트웨어 채널 목록 전체로 이동하여 사용 가능한 채널을 검색할 수 있습니다. 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하여 새 채널을 수정하거나 생성할 수 있습니다. 사용자 지정 채널을 포함한 채널 사용에 대한 자세한 내용은 채널 관리를 참조하십시오. SUSE Package Hub는 SUSE Linux Enterprise 제품의 확장으로, openSUSE 커뮤니티가 제공하는 추가 오픈 소스 소프트웨어를 제공합니다.

SUSE Package Hub는 다수의 패키지를 제공하므로 동기화하는 데 시간이 오래 걸리고 대량의 디스크 공간을 소비할 수 있습니다. SUSE Package Hub가 제공하는 패키지가 필요하지 않은 경우 SUSE Package Hub를 활성화하지 마십시오. 지원되지 않는 패키지를 의도치 않게 설치하거나 업데이트하지 않도록 하려면 처음에 모든 SUSE Package Hub 패키지를 거부하는 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리 전략을 구현하는 것이 좋습니다. 그러면 필요한 특정 패키지를 명시적으로 활성화할 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리에 대한 자세한 내용은 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리을 참조하십시오. Red Hat 기반 클라이언트의 경우 AppStream을 통해 추가 패키지가 제공됩니다. 대부분의 경우 AppStream 패키지가 있어야 필요한 소프트웨어를 모두 보유할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 AppStream 패키지를 관리할 때 패키지 업데이트에 대한 모순되는 제안을 볼 수도 있습니다. 이는 Uyuni이(가) 모듈 메타데이터를 올바르게 해석할 수 없기 때문입니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리(CLM) AppStream 필터를 사용하여 AppStream 리포지토리를 일부 업그레이드 작업에서 사용할 비모듈형 리포지토리로 변환할 수 있습니다. CLM AppStream 필터에 대한 자세한 설명은 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리 예제에서 참조하십시오. Red Hat 기반 클라이언트의 경우 EPEL(엔터프라이즈 Linux용 추가 패키지)을 통해 추가 패키지가 제공됩니다. EPEL은 추가 소프트웨어를 제공하는 옵션 패키지 리포지토리입니다. EPEL의 패키지는 Fedora 커뮤니티가 제공합니다. 이 패키지는 SUSE에서 지원하지 않습니다. 클라이언트에서 Red Hat 운영 체제를 사용 중인 경우 EPEL 확장을 활성화하여 이러한 추가 패키지에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 클라이언트를 가입할 수 있는 EPEL 채널이 제공됩니다. EPEL은 다수의 패키지를 제공하므로 동기화하는 데 시간이 오래 걸리고 대량의 디스크 공간을 소비할 수 있습니다.

For example, you can migrate SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2. You can also migrate openSUSE Leap to a later minor version or to the corresponding SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SP level, for example: openSUSE Leap 15.1에서 15.2로 또는 openSUSE Leap 15.1 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1, or openSUSE Leap 15.5 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5 마이그레이션 과정에서 Uyuni는 설치 전에 필요한 모든 라이선스(EULA)를 자동으로 수락합니다. In SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and later, SUSE supports service pack skipping if SUSE Customer Center provides it. For example, you can upgrade from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 to SP2, without installing SP1. For supported SUSE Linux Enterprise Server upgrade paths, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-paths.html#sec-upgrade-paths-supported.

It is the task of the administrator to decide which keys are needed and can be trusted. Because a software channel cannot be used when the GPG key is not trusted, the decision of assigning a channel to a client depends on the decision of trusting the key. GPG 키에 대한 자세한 내용은 GPG 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Debian 클라이언트를 설치하려면 여러 개의 GPG 키가 필요할 수 있습니다. 타사 Debian 리포지토리를 동기화하는 경우 서버에서 적절한 GPG 키를 가져와야 합니다. GPG 키가 누락되면 동기화에 실패합니다. Debian 리포지토리의 경우, 메타데이터만 서명됩니다. 그러므로 소프트웨어 채널용 GPG 키를 가져올 필요가 없습니다. Uyuni는 패키지에 다시 서명하지 않습니다.

It leverages the enterprise hardened security and compliance components of SUSE Linux Enterprise and merges them with a modern, immutable, developer-friendly OS platform. The openSUSE Leap Micro uses transactional updates. Transactional updates are atomic (all updates are applied only if all updates succeed) and support rollbacks. They do not affect the running system because no changes are activated until the system is rebooted.

Synchronization can sometimes take several hours. openSUSE Leap Micro clients require reboot after registering. Reboot is automatically scheduled after registration is completed, but it is respecting the default reboot manager maintenance window. This window may be several hours after the client is registered. To speed up openSUSE Leap Micro registration, manually reboot the client after the registration script finishes. To register openSUSE Leap Micro clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.

GPG 키 관리 6. 클라이언트 등록 This section contains information about using Red Hat update infrastructure (RHUI) to register traditional and Salt clients running Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems. Traditional clients are available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 only. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 clients are supported as Salt clients. Amazon EC2와 같은 공용 클라우드에서 클라이언트를 실행하는 경우 이 방법을 사용하십시오. RHUI를 Red Hat 컨텐트 제공 네트워크(CDN)와 함께 사용하여 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 구독을 관리할 수 있습니다. Red Hat CDN 사용에 대한 정보는 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 클라이언트를 CDN으로 등록을 참조하십시오. You are responsible for connecting Uyuni Server to the Red Hat update infrastructure. All clients that get updates using this RHUI certificate need to be correctly licensed, please check with your cloud provider and the Red Hat terms of service for more information. RHUI로 등록한 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 클라이언트가 켜져 있지 않은 경우 Red Hat은 인증서가 잘못되었다고 선언할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 클라이언트를 다시 켜거나 새 RHUI 인증서를 가져와야 합니다. Red Hat 클라이언트는 Red Hat 인증 주체(CA)와 자격 인증서 및 자격 키가 있어야 합니다. Red Hat 클라이언트는 URL을 사용해 리포지토리를 복제합니다. URL은 Red Hat 클라이언트가 어디에 등록되었는지에 따라 달라집니다. Red Hat 클라이언트는 다음 세 가지 방식으로 등록할 수 있습니다. redhat.com의 Red Hat 컨텐트 제공 네트워크(CDN) Red Hat Satellite 서버 클라우드의 Red Hat 업데이트 인프라(RHUI) 이 안내서에서는 Red Hat 업데이트 인프라(RHUI)에 등록된 클라이언트에 대해 설명합니다. RHUI에 등록된 시스템이 최소 한 개 있어야 하고, 이와 함께 리포지토리 컨텐트에 대한 인증 구독이 있어야 합니다. Red Hat 컨텐트 제공 네트워크(CDN)를 사용하는 방법에 대한 정보 대신에 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 클라이언트를 CDN으로 등록을 참조하십시오. 클라이언트 시스템에 대한 Satellite 서버는 Satellite 서버 및 구독이 있어야 합니다. Satellite 인증서를 사용하는 클라이언트는 Uyuni 서버에서 지원하지 않습니다. The entitlement certificates and keys need to be copied from the client system to a location that your web browser can access. 키 및 인증서의 이름은 여기에 표시되는 이름과 약간 다를 수 있습니다. 자격 인증서 및 Red Hat CA 인증서 파일의 파일 확장자는 .crt입니다. 키의 파일 확장자는 .key입니다. 절차: 인증서를 서버에 복사 Copy your entitlement certificate and key from the client system, to your workstation: Amazon EC2 cp /etc/pki/rhui/product/content-.crt //entitlement/ cp /etc/pki/rhui/content-.key //entitlement/ Azure 다음 명령을 사용하여 인증서 체인을 확인합니다. openssl s_client -connect rhui-1.microsoft.com:443 -showcerts 샘플 출력은 다음과 같습니다.

The certificate will be downloaded with the .cer suffix. Convert it to .crt with the command: openssl x509 -inform DER -in -out Google Cloud Platform cp /etc/pki/rhui/product/content.crt //entitlement/ cp /etc/pki/rhui/key.pem //entitlement/ 다음과 같이 클라이언트 시스템에서 자격 인증서 및 키와 동일한 위치로 Red Hat CA 인증서 파일을 복사합니다. Amazon EC2 cp /etc/pki/rhui/cdn.redhat.com-chain.crt //entitlement Azure 변환된 인증서를 //entitlement에 업로드합니다. Google Cloud Platform cp /etc/pki/rhui/ca.crt //entitlement To manage repositories on your Red Hat client, you need to import the CA and entitlement certificates to the Uyuni Server. This requires that you perform the import procedure three times, to create three entries, one of each for the entitlement certificate, the entitlement key, and the Red Hat certificate. 절차: 인증서를 서버에 임포트 Uyuni 서버 Web UI에서 시스템 자동 설치 GPG 및 SSL 키로 이동합니다. 저장된 키/인증서 생성을 클릭하고 자격 인증서에 대해 다음 파라미터를 설정합니다. 설명 필드에 Entitlement-Cert-Date를 입력합니다. 유형 필드에서 SSL을 선택합니다. 업로드할 파일을 선택해주십시오 필드에서 자격 인증서를 저장한 위치로 이동하여 .crt 인증서 파일을 선택합니다. 키 생성을 클릭합니다. 저장된 키/인증서 생성을 클릭하고 자격 키에 대해 다음 파라미터를 설정합니다. 설명 필드에 Entitlement-Key-Date를 입력합니다. 유형 필드에서 SSL을 선택합니다. 업로드할 파일을 선택해주십시오 필드에서 자격 키를 저장한 위치로 이동하여 .key 키 파일을 선택합니다. 키 생성을 클릭합니다. 저장된 키/인증서 생성을 클릭하고 Red Hat 인증서에 대해 다음 파라미터를 설정합니다. 설명 필드에 redhat-cert를 입력합니다. 유형 필드에서 SSL을 선택합니다. 업로드할 파일을 선택해주십시오 필드에서 Red Hat 인증서를 저장한 위치로 이동하여 인증서 파일을 선택합니다. 키 생성을 클릭합니다.

OSAD에는 서로 뚜렷이 구분되는 구성요소가 몇 가지 있습니다. osa-dispatcher 서비스는 서버에서 실행되며 데이터베이스 검사를 사용해 클라이언트에 ping을 수행해야 하는지 또는 작업을 실행해야 하는지 여부를 판단합니다. osad 서비스는 클라이언트에서 실행됩니다. 이 서비스는 osa-dispatcher에서 보내는 ping에 반응하며 mgr_check을 실행하여 지시에 따라 작업을 수행합니다. jabberd 서비스는 클라이언트와 서버 간 통신을 위해 XMPP 프로토콜을 사용하는 데몬입니다. 또한 jabberd 서비스는 인증을 처리합니다. mgr_check 도구는 작업을 수행할 클라이언트에서 실행됩니다. osa-dispatcher 서비스가 통신을 시도하면 트리거됩니다. osa-dispatcher는 주기적으로 쿼리를 실행하여 클라이언트가 마지막으로 네트워크 활동을 보인 시점을 확인합니다. 최근에 활동을 보이지 않은 클라이언트를 찾으면 Uyuni 서버에 등록된 모든 클라이언트에서 실행되는 모든 osad 인스턴스에 jabberd를 사용해 ping을 실행합니다. osad 인스턴스는 서버의 배경에서 실행 중인 jabberd를 사용해 ping에 응답합니다. osa-dispatcher가 이 응답을 수신하면 클라이언트를 온라인으로 표시합니다. osa-dispatcher가 특정 기간 내에 응답을 수신하는 데 실패하는 경우에는 클라이언트를 오프라인으로 표시합니다. OSAD를 지원하는 시스템에서 작업을 예약하면 작업이 즉시 수행됩니다. osa-dispatcher는 클라이언트에 실행해야 할 작업이 있는지 주기적으로 확인합니다. 미결 작업이 발견되면 jabberd를 사용해 클라이언트에서 mgr_check를 실행합니다. 그러면 클라이언트가 작업을 실행합니다. OSAD 클라이언트는 서버의 전체 도메인 이름(FQDN)을 사용해 osa-dispatcher 서비스와 통신합니다. SSL이 있어야 osad 통신이 가능합니다.

The Salt clients are also known as Salt minions. Uyuni Server installs a daemon on every client. If you need to use Salt clients in a disconnected setup you can configure Push via Salt SSH as a contact method. With this contact method, clients can be located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. For more information about Push via Salt SSH, see Salt SSH를 통한 푸시. Salt에는 minion용 키를 저장하기 위한 자체 데이터베이스가 있습니다. 이것은 Uyuni 데이터베이스와 동기화된 상태로 유지되어야 합니다. Salt에서 키가 수락되면 Uyuni에서 온보딩 프로세스가 바로 시작됩니다. 온보딩 프로세스는 minion_id 및 machine-id를 검색하여 Uyuni 데이터베이스에서 기존 시스템을 찾습니다. 검색 결과가 없으면 새 시스템이 생성됩니다. minion_id 또는 machine-id가 포함된 항목이 있는 경우, 새 시스템과 일치하도록 해당 시스템이 마이그레이션됩니다. 두 항목 모두에 대한 일치 항목이 있고 동일한 시스템이 아닌 경우, 오류와 함께 온보딩이 중단됩니다. 이 경우 관리자가 시스템을 1개 이상 제거하여 충돌을 해결해야 합니다.","title":"Salt 클라이언트를 위한 연결 방법","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-salt","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-salt.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 온보딩 정보","hash":"onboarding-details","id":1}]},"95":{"id":95,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Salt Bundle을 사용한 Salt SSH 4. pip를 사용하여 Python 패키지와 함께 Salt Bundle 확장 Salt Bundle은 Salt Minion, Python 3, 필수 Python 모듈 및 라이브러리가 포함된 단일 바이너리 패키지입니다. Salt Bundle은 Python 3 및 Salt를 실행하기 위한 모든 요구 사항과 함께 제공됩니다. 따라서 Salt Bundle은 클라이언트에 설치된 Python 버전을 시스템 소프트웨어로 사용하지 않습니다. Salt Bundle은 해당 Salt 버전에 대한 요구 사항을 충족하지 않는 클라이언트에 설치할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Salt Master가 아닌 Salt Master에 연결된 Salt Minion을 실행하는 시스템에서도 Salt Bundle을 사용할 수 있습니다. Salt Bundle에 등록하는 방법이 권장되는 등록 방법입니다. 이 섹션에서는 현재 구현의 장점과 제한 사항을 설명합니다. Salt Bundle은 Salt, Python 3 및 Salt가 사용하는 Python 모듈로 구성된 venv-salt-minion으로 제공됩니다. Web UI를 사용한 부트스트랩은 Salt Bundle도 사용하므로 Web UI를 사용한 부트스트랩은 Python에 종속되지 않습니다. Salt Bundle을 사용하면 더 이상 클라이언트가 Python 해석기 또는 모듈을 제공할 필요가 없습니다. 새 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하는 경우 Salt Bundle에 등록하는 것이 기본 방법입니다. 기존 클라이언트를 Salt Bundle 방식으로 전환할 수 있습니다. 전환하면 salt-minion 패키지와 종속 항목이 설치된 상태로 유지됩니다. Salt Bundle은 Uyuni Server가 아닌 Salt Master가 관리하는 Salt Minion과 동시에 사용할 수 있습니다. Salt Bundle이 클라이언트에 설치된 경우 Uyuni Server가 Salt Bundle의 구성 파일을 관리하며, 이 경우 salt-minion의 구성 파일은 관리되지 않습니다. 자세한 내용은 Salt Bundle 구성을 참조하십시오. Uyuni Server가 아닌 Salt Master가 관리하는 Salt Minion으로 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하려면 부트스트랩을 생성할 때 mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 스크립트를 사용하거나 부트스트랩 스크립트에서 FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION을 1로 설정하십시오. Web UI mgr_force_venv_salt_minion이 true로 설정된 부트스트래핑의 경우 열을 전역적으로 지정할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 Salt States and Pillars에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Salt 상태 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 사용하여 salt-minion에서 venv-salt-minion으로 전환할 수 있습니다. 프로세스 이동 문제를 방지하려면 두 단계에 걸쳐 venv-salt-minion으로 전환하는 것이 좋습니다. 절차: util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion 상태를 venv-salt-minion으로 전환 우선 열을 지정하지 않고 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 적용하십시오. 그러면 구성 파일 등을 복사하는 venv-salt-minion으로 전환됩니다. 원래 salt-minion 구성 및 해당 패키지는 정리되지 않습니다. salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion mgr_purge_non_venv_salt가 True로 설정된 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 적용하여 salt-minion을 제거하고 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files을 True로 설정하여 salt-minion과 관련된 모든 파일을 제거하십시오. 이 두 번째 단계는 첫 번째 단계가 처리되었는지 확인한 후 이전 구성 파일과 더 이상 사용되지 않는 salt-minion 패키지를 제거합니다. salt state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' 첫 번째 단계를 건너뛰고 두 번째 전환 단계를 실행하는 경우 클라이언트 측에서 명령을 실행하기 위해 사용되는 salt-minion을 중지해야 하므로 상태 적용 프로세스가 실패할 수 있습니다. 반면에 Salt Bundle을 설치하지 않고 대신 salt-minion을 계속 사용하는 것도 가능합니다. 이 경우 다음 옵션 중 하나를 지정: --no-bundle 옵션으로 mgr-bootstrap을 실행하십시오. 생성된 부트스트랩 스크립트에서 AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION을 1로 설정합니다. 부트스트랩 상태에 대하여 mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion 열을 True로 설정합니다. Salt Bundle은 클라이언트로 Salt SSH 작업을 수행할 때도 사용됩니다. 셸 스크립트는 Salt 명령이 실행되기 전 venv-salt-minion을 설치하지 않고 대상 시스템에 Salt Bundle을 배포합니다. Salt Bundle에는 전체 Salt 코드 기반이 포함되어 있으므로 salt-thin이 배포되지 않습니다. Salt SSH(Web UI를 사용한 부트스트랩 포함)는 번들 내의 Python 3 해석기를 사용합니다. 대상 시스템에는 다른 Python 해석기를 설치할 필요가 없습니다. Bundle과 함께 배포된 Python 3는 클라이언트에서 Salt SSH 세션을 처리하기 위해 사용되므로 Salt SSH(Web UI를 사용한 부트스트래핑 포함)는 시스템에 설치된 Python에 종속되지 않습니다. salt-thin을 사용하는 것은 대체 방법으로 활성화할 수 있지만 클라이언트에 Python 3을 설치해야 합니다. 이 방법은 권장되거나 지원되지 않으며 개발 목적으로만 존재합니다. /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 구성 파일에서 web.ssh_use_salt_thin을 true로 설정합니다. The bootstrap repository must be created before bootstrapping the client with Web UI. Salt SSH is using the Salt Bundle taken from the bootstrap repository based on the detected target operating system. For more information, see client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository. Salt SSH는 /var/tmp를 사용하여 Salt Bundle을 배포하고 번들된 Python으로 클라이언트에서 Salt 명령을 실행합니다. 그러므로 noexec 옵션으로 /var/tmp를 마운트하지 않아야 합니다. 부트스트랩 프로세스는 Salt SSH를 사용하여 클라이언트에 도달하므로 /var/tmp가 noexec 옵션으로 마운트된 클라이언트를 Web UI로 부트스트랩할 수 없습니다. Salt Bundle에는 번들로 제공되는 Salt Minion의 기능을 추가 Python 패키지로 확장할 수 있는 pip가 포함되어 있습니다. 기본적으로 salt pip.install 은 에 의해 지정된 Python 패키지를 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local에 설치합니다. 필요한 경우 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local 경로는 venv-salt-minion.service에 대한 VENV_PIP_TARGET 환경 변수를 설정하여 재정의할 수 있습니다. 서비스에 대한 systemd drop-in 구성 파일을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 이는 구성 파일 /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf를 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다. [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip pip를 통해 설치된 Python 패키지는 Salt Bundle을 업데이트할 때 변경되지 않습니다. 업데이트 이후에 해당 패키지를 사용 가능하고 작동하는 상태로 만들려면 Salt Bundle 업데이트 후에 적용되는 Salt 상태로 패키지를 설치하는 것이 좋습니다.","title":"Salt Bundle","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ. No system within the DMZ is authorized to open a connection to the internal network where the Uyuni Server is located. Push via Salt SSH is also to use if installing a daemon agent on clients is not possible. The Push via Salt SSH method has serious limitations. It does not scale well, and consumes more Server resources and network bandwidth than the plain Salt method. The Push via Salt SSH method is not at all supported with large setups (1000 clients and more). The Push via Salt SSH method creates an encrypted tunnel from the Uyuni Server on the internal network to the clients located in the DMZ. After all actions such as updates and events are pushed and executed, the tunnel is closed. The server uses the Salt SSH to contact the clients at regular intervals, checking in and performing scheduled actions and events. 아래 이미지는 Salt SSH를 통한 푸시 프로세스 경로를 나타낸 것입니다. Taskomatic 블록 왼쪽에 있는 모든 항목은 Uyuni 클라이언트에서 실행되는 프로세스를 나타냅니다. To use Push via Salt SSH, you must have the SSH daemon running on the client, and reachable by the salt-api daemon running on the Uyuni Server. Additionally, the required Python version will be installed with the salt-bundle on the remote system. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, CentOS 5 및 이전 버전은 지원되지 않는 Python 버전을 사용하므로 지원되지 않습니다. 절차: Salt SSH를 통한 푸시로 클라이언트 등록 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 부트스트랩으로 이동하여 해당 필드를 완성합니다. Select an activation key with the Push via SSH contact method configured. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. SSH를 통해 시스템을 완전히 관리 확인란을 선택합니다. 부트스트랩을 클릭하여 등록을 시작합니다. 시스템 개요로 이동하여 시스템이 올바르게 등록되었는지 확인합니다. Salt SSH를 통한 푸시를 구성하는 경우 호스트, 활성화 키, 비밀번호 등 시스템 등록 시 사용되는 파라미터를 수정할 수 있습니다. 비밀번호는 부트스트래핑에만 사용되며 어느 곳에도 저장되지 않습니다. 향후 모든 SSH 세션은 키/인증서 페어를 통해 인증됩니다. 이러한 파라미터는 시스템 부트스트랩에서 구성합니다. You can also configure persistent parameters that are used system-wide, including the sudo user. For more information on configuring the sudo user, see SSH를 통한 푸시. Salt SSH를 통한 푸시 기능은 Taskomatic을 사용해 salt-ssh로 예약된 작업을 실행합니다. Taskomatic 작업은 예약된 작업을 주기적으로 확인하여 실행합니다. 기존 클라이언트에서 SSH를 통해 푸시하는 것과 달리 Salt SSH를 통한 푸시 기능은 예약된 작업에 근거하여 완전한 salt-ssh 호출을 실행합니다. 기본적으로 한 번에 20건의 Salt SSH 작업을 실행할 수 있습니다. 구성 파일에 다음과 같은 줄을 추가하고 parallel_threads의 값을 상향 조정하여 병렬로 실행할 수 있는 작업의 수를 늘릴 수 있습니다. 문제를 방지하기 위해 병렬 작업의 수를 다음과 같이 낮게 유지하는 것이 좋습니다. taskomatic.com.redhat.rhn.taskomatic.task.SSHMinionActionExecutor.parallel_threads = org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = 이렇게 하여 어느 한 곳의 클라이언트에서 병렬로 실행할 수 있는 작업의 수와 Taskomatic이 사용하는 작업자 스레드의 총 개수를 조정할 수 있습니다. 작업을 여러 클라이언트에서 실행해야 하는 경우 작업은 항상 각 클라이언트에서 순차적으로 실행됩니다. 클라이언트가 프록시를 통해 연결되어 있는 경우 프록시에서 MaxSessions 설정을 조정해야 합니다. 이 경우 병렬 연결의 수를 클라이언트 총 수의 세 배로 설정합니다. Salt SSH를 통한 푸시에서는 아직 지원하지 않는 몇 가지 기능이 있습니다. 다음 기능은 Salt SSH 클라이언트에서 작동하지 않습니다. OpenSCAP 감사 Beacons, 이로 인해 zypper를 사용해 시스템에 패키지를 설치해도 패키지 새로 고침이 호출되지 않습니다. 가상 호스트 기능(예: 게스트에 대한 호스트)은 가상 호스트 시스템이 Salt SSH 기반인 경우 작동하지 않습니다.

RPM 패키지에는 직접 서명할 수 있지만, Debian 기반 시스템은 메타데이터에만 서명하고 체크섬 체인을 사용하여 패키지를 보호합니다. 대부분의 RPM 기반 시스템은 서명된 패키지뿐만 아니라 서명된 메타데이터를 사용합니다. 운영 체제는 자체 GPG 키를 직접 신뢰하거나 최소 시스템 이상과 함께 설치된 상태로 제공됩니다. 그러나 다른 GPG 키로 서명된 타사 패키지는 수동으로 처리해야 합니다. 클라이언트는 신뢰할 수 있는 GPG 키가 없어도 성공적으로 부트스트래핑할 수 있습니다. 하지만 키를 신뢰할 수 있을 때까지는 새 클라이언트 도구 패키지를 설치하거나 업데이트할 수 없습니다. Salt clients now use GPG key information entered for a software channel to manage the trusted keys. When a software channel with GPG key information is assigned to a client, the key is trusted as soon as the channel is refreshed or the first package gets installed from this channel. The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system. Debian 기반 시스템은 메타데이터에만 서명하므로 단일 채널에 대해 추가 키를 지정할 필요가 없습니다. 리포지토리 메타데이터 서명에서 \"자체 GPG 키 사용\"의 설명과 같이 사용자가 자체 GPG 키를 구성하여 메타데이터에 서명하는 경우 해당 키의 배포 및 신뢰가 자동으로 실행됩니다. 사용자는 클라이언트에 배포할 자체 GPG 키를 정의할 수 있습니다. 일부 열 데이터를 제공하고 Salt 파일 시스템에 GPG 키 파일을 제공하면 클라이언트에 자동으로 배포됩니다. 이러한 키는 RPM 기반 운영 체제의 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/및 Debian 시스템의 /usr/share/keyrings/에 배포됩니다. 키를 배포할 클라이언트에 대한 열 키 custom_gpgkeys를 정의하고 키 파일의 이름을 나열합니다. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg 추가적으로 Salt 파일 시스템에서 gpg 디렉토리를 생성한 후 해당 디렉토리에 custom_gpgkeys 열 데이터에 지정된 이름으로 GPG 키 파일을 저장합니다. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 이제 키는 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 및 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg의 클라이언트에 배포됩니다. 마지막 단계로 소프트웨어 채널의 GPG 키 URL 필드에 URL을 추가합니다. 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하고 수정할 채널을 선택합니다.

Salt 클라이언트의 경우 가상화 호스트 자격을 활성화해야 합니다. 이렇게 하면 VM 변경 사항을 즉시 볼 수 있습니다. 이를 위해서는 Uyuni Web UI에서 호스트의 시스템 정보 페이지로 이동하여 등록 정보 탭을 클릭하십시오. 또는 등록 키 수준에서 가상화 호스트 자격을 추가할 수 있습니다. 추가 시스템 유형 섹션에서 가상화 호스트의 확인란을 선택하고 등록 정보 업데이트를 클릭하여 변경 사항을 저장합니다. 다음과 같이 Salt Minion 서비스를 다시 시작하여 변경 사항을 활성화합니다. systemctl restart salt-minion 기존 클라이언트의 경우 VM 호스트는 기본적으로 rhnsd 서비스를 사용해 예약된 작업을 확인합니다. 이러한 확인은 네 시간마다 이루어지며, 이를 통해 다수의 클라이언트가 있는 환경에서 로드를 밸런싱합니다. 이로 인해 작업이 수행될 때까지 최대 네 시간의 지연이 발생할 수 있습니다. VM 게스트를 관리하고 있다면 이처럼 긴 지연 시간이 항상 좋은 것은 아닙니다(특히 게스트 재부팅과 같은 작업일 경우). 이 문제를 해결하려면 rhnsd 서비스를 비활성화하고 osad 서비스를 활성화하면 됩니다. osad 서비스는 jabber 프로토콜을 사용해 명령을 수신하고 명령을 즉시 실행합니다. rhnsd 서비스를 비활성화하고 osad 데몬을 활성화하려면 루트 사용자로 다음 명령을 실행하십시오. service rhnsd stop service rhnsd disable service osad enable service osad start AutoYaST 또는 Kickstart를 사용해 Xen 및 KVM 게스트를 자동으로 설치하고 등록할 수 있습니다. 게스트를 등록하려는 VM 호스트와 각 게스트에 활성화 키가 필요합니다. 활성화 키에는 조달 및 가상화 플랫폼 자격이 있어야 합니다. 활성화 키에는 mgr-virtualization-host 및 mgr-osad 패키지에 대한 액세스 권한도 있어야 합니다. 활성화 키 생성에 대한 자세한 내용은 활성화 키 를 참조하십시오. 설치 후 Uyuni로 게스트를 자동 등록하려면 부트스트랩 스크립트를 생성해야 합니다. 부트스트랩 스크립트 생성에 대한 자세한 내용은 부트스트랩 스크립트로 클라이언트 등록을 참조하십시오. VM 게스트 자동 설치는 기존 클라이언트로 구성된 경우에만 작동합니다. Salt 클라이언트는 AutoYaST 또는 Kickstart가 아닌 템플릿 디스크 이미지를 사용해 생성할 수 있습니다. Uyuni에서 클라이언트를 자동 설치하려면 VM 호스트에 자동 설치 가능한 배포를 생성해야 합니다. 마운트한 로컬 또는 원격 디렉토리나 루프 마운트 ISO 이미지에서 배포를 사용할 수 있는 상태로 만들 수 있습니다. 자동 설치 가능한 배포의 구성은 게스트에서 SLES 또는 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 운영 체제를 사용하고 있는지 여부에 따라 달라집니다. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 설치를 위한 패키지는 연결된 기본 채널에서 가져옵니다. SUSE 시스템 설치를 위한 패키지는 자동 설치 가능한 배포에서 가져옵니다. 따라서 SLES 시스템의 경우 자동 설치 가능한 배포는 완전한 설치 소스이어야 합니다. Table 1. 자동 설치 가능한 배포를 위한 경로 운영 체제 유형 커널 위치 initrd 위치 Red Hat Enterprise Linux images/pxeboot/vmlinuz images/pxeboot/initrd.img SLES boot//loader/initrd boot//loader/linux 모든 경우 기본 채널이 자동 설치 배포와 일치하는지 확인하십시오. 시작하기 전에 VM 호스트에 사용할 수 있는 설치 미디어가 있는지 확인하십시오. 이러한 설치 미디어는 네트워크 리소스, 로컬 디렉토리 또는 루프 마운트 ISO 이미지에 있을 수 있습니다. 또한 모든 파일 및 디렉토리가 누구나 읽을 수 있는 것인지 확인하십시오. 절차: 자동 설치 가능한 배포 생성 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 자동 설치 배포판으로 이동한 후 배포 생성을 클릭합니다. 자동 설치 가능한 배포판 생성 섹션에서 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 배포판 레이블 섹션에 배포판의 고유 이름을 입력합니다. 글자, 숫자, 하이픈(-), 마침표(.), 밑줄(_)만 사용하고, 이름을 구성하는 문자는 다섯 개 이상이어야 합니다. 트리 경로 필드에 설치 원본의 절대 경로를 입력합니다. 기본 채널 필드에서 설치 소스와 일치하는 채널을 선택합니다. 이 채널은 비SUSE 설치에 대해 패키지 소스로 사용됩니다. 설치 프로그램 생성 필드에서 설치 소스와 일치하는 운영 체제 버전을 선택합니다. 커널 옵션 필드에는, 설치를 위해 부팅할 때 커널로 전달될 옵션을 입력합니다. install= 파라미터와 self_update=0 pt.options=self_update 파라미터가 기본적으로 추가됩니다. 커널 후 옵션 섹션에는, 설치된 시스템을 처음 부팅할 때 커널로 전달될 옵션을 입력합니다. 자동 설치 가능한 배포판 생성을 클릭하여 저장합니다. 자동 설치 가능한 배포판을 생성했으면 시스템 자동 설치 배포판으로 이동하여 편집할 배포판을 선택하고 편집할 수 있습니다. 자동 설치 프로파일에는 시스템을 설치하는 데 필요한 모든 설치 및 구성 데이터가 포함되어 있습니다. 설치 완료 후 실행될 스크립트도 포함할 수 있습니다. Kickstart 프로파일은 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 자동 설치 프로파일로 이동하여 새 Kickstart 파일 생성을 클릭하고 표시되는 프롬프트에 따라 생성할 수 있습니다. AutoYaST 또는 Kickstart 자동 설치 프로파일을 수동으로 생성할 수도 있습니다. SUSE는 사용자 정의 파일의 시작점으로 사용할 수 있는 AutoYaST 설치 파일의 템플릿을 제공합니다. 템플릿은 https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles에서 확인할 수 있습니다. AutoYaST를 사용하여 SLES를 설치하는 경우 다음 코드 조각도 포함해야 합니다.

Related topics You can use configuration files and channels to manage configuration for your clients, rather than configuring each client manually. This workflow shows you how to use the Uyuni Web UI to create a centrally managed configuration file, assign it to a Salt client, and apply the configuration. If you are managing a lot of clients, you probably do not want to manually apply configuration settings to each of them in turn. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a configuration channel containing a configuration file, have assigned clients to the channel, and applied the configuration successfully. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. At least one Salt client registered to your server. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a centrally managed configuration file and a Salt state. You can also use locally managed configuration files, traditional clients, and different methods, to get more flexibility in how you manage configuration in your environment. For more information about the different ways to manage configuration, see 구성 관리. Procedure: Create a new configuration channel and file In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels and click Create State Channel. Type a name, label, and description for your configuration file, and type the contents of your configuration file. An example that you can copy is at the end of this section. . Click Create Config State Channel Procedure: Assign clients to the configuration channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Systems List and select the client you want to assign to your configuration channel. Navigate to the Configuration tab. In the guimenu:Configuration Overview section, click Subscribe to channels. Check the configuration channel you created earlier, and click Continue. If you have more than one configuration channel, you can rank them in order of importance, or click Update Channel Rankings to finish.

Related topics If you are managing a lot of clients and you need to apply customized packages to them, you can use content lifecycle management (CLM) to manage your packages. CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, which you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. Procedure: Create a new CLM project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project. The available child channels for the selected base channel are displayed, including information on whether the channel is mandatory or recommended. Check the child channels you require, and click Save to return to the project page. Leave the Filters section blank for now, we will not be using them in this example. You can add filters later on if you need to. In the Environment Lifecycle section, create three environments: production, testing, and development. Click Add Environment and complete the name and label for each. For the production environment, leave the Insert before field blank. For the testing environment, in the Insert before field, select production. For the development environment, in the Insert before field, select testing``. Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel -production-. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel -testing-. Click Next to assign the client. Procedure: Promote Environments In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects, and select the project you want to work with. In the Environment Lifecycle section, locate the environment to promote to its successor, and click Promote. You can monitor build progress in the Environment Lifecycle section.

Migration of Traditional clients This workflow shows how to automatically complete the task of in-place SUSE Linux Enterprise Server instances upgrade with Uyuni Server. The workflow is applicable for both Salt and Traditional clients. In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/Autoyast file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade true #if $channel_prefix != \"\" https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #else https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree #end if $channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool sle-manager-tools Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration depending on the type of your client. For Salt clients, go to Migration of Salt clients. For Traditional clients, go to Migration of Traditional clients. Procedure: Migrating Salt clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. + image::wf-inplaceMigration-06.png[scaledwidth=80%] + image::wf-inplaceMigration-07.png[scaledwidth=80%] Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time for Salt clients. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console. If your profile is clean, it should complete an in-place migration in about 30 minutes - depending on the speed of your network, client, and the number of required packages in the migration. Procedure: Migrating Traditional clients Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. If your system is able to use PXE, it can be completely automated from here. If your system is not able to use PXE, you can create an ISO to install with cobbler commands using the SUSE Manager server CLI. Copy the ISO file output to the machine you wish to migrate and boot from it. View all the profiles with this: cobbler profile list Output will look something like: 15sp1-demo-test:1:Demosite Then build the ISO file with this command: cobbler buildiso --iso=/tmp/15sp1-demo-test.iso --profiles=15sp1-demo-test:1:Demosite The --iso= section is the output of the buildiso command, and needs full path. Copy this ISO to the virtualization environment where your system can use it as boot media.","title":"In-place upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Step-by-step workflow instructions 5. Related topics Uyuni is all about managing client systems. So one of the first things you need to do is onboard some clients. This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see 지원되는 클라이언트 시스템. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see 클라이언트 등록 방법. Procedure: Configure a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on your client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.suma.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.suma.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare software channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an activation key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Uyuni for Retail 하드웨어 요구사항은 Retail Requirements을 참조하십시오. Uyuni 서버는 /var/spacewalk/ 디렉토리에 패키지를 저장합니다. 이 디렉토리의 공간이 부족하면 리포지토리를 동기화할 수 없습니다. /var/spacewalk/ 디렉토리에 필요한 공간은 미러링할 클라이언트 및 리포지토리에 따라 예상할 수 있습니다. Table 1. x86-64 아키텍처에 대한 서버 하드웨어 요구사항 하드웨어 세부 정보 권장 CPU - 최소 4개의 전용 64비트 CPU 코어(x86-64) RAM 테스트 서버 최소 8GB 기본 설치 최소 16GB 프로덕션 서버 최소 32GB 디스크 공간 /(루트 디렉토리) 최소 40GB /var/lib/pgsql 최소 50GB /var/spacewalk SUSE 제품당 최소 50GB 및 Red Hat 제품당 360GB /var/cache 최소 10GB SUSE 제품당 100MB, Red Hat 또는 기타 제품당 1GB 추가. 서버가 ISS Master인 경우 두 배의 공간. 스왑 공간 3GB Uyuni 성능은 하드웨어 리소스, 네트워크 대역폭, 클라이언트와 서버 간 대기 시간 등에 따라 달라집니다. 사용 중인 환경과 다양한 배포에 따라 적절한 수의 프록시가 배치된 Uyuni 서버의 최적 성능을 달성하려면 단일 서버당 10,000개의 클라이언트를 초과하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 클라이언트가 10,000개를 초과하는 경우 허브 설정으로 이동하여 컨설팅을 포함하는 것이 매우 권장됩니다. 미세 조정 및 적절한 수의 프록시가 포함된 경우에도 클라이언트의 수가 그렇게 많으면 성능 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 대규모 클라이언트 관리에 대한 자세한 내용은 Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deployments에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Table 2. 프록시 하드웨어 요구사항 하드웨어 세부 정보 권장 CPU 최소 2개의 전용 64비트 CPU 코어 RAM 테스트 서버 최소 2GB 프로덕션 서버 최소 8GB 디스크 공간 /(루트 디렉토리) 최소 40GB /srv 최소 100GB /var/cache(Squid) 최소 100GB Uyuni 프록시는 /var/cache/ 디렉토리에 패키지를 캐시합니다. /var/cache/의 공간이 부족한 경우 프록시는 사용되지 않는 오래된 패키지를 제거한 후 새 패키지로 교체합니다. 이 동작의 결과: 프록시에서 /var/cache/디렉토리에 더 많은 공간이 확보되고 프록시와 Uyuni 서버 간의 트래픽이 감소합니다. 프록시에서 /var/cache/디렉토리의 크기와 Uyuni 서버에서 /var/spacewalk/의 크기를 동일하게 설정하면, 최초 동기화 후 대규모 트래픽이 발생하는 것을 방지할 수 있습니다. Uyuni 서버의 /var/cache/ 디렉토리는 프록시에 비해 작을 수 있습니다. 크기 예상에 대한 설명은 서버 하드웨어 요구사항 섹션을 참조하십시오. Uyuni용 리포지토리와 데이터베이스는 별도의 저장소 장치에 저장하는 것이 좋습니다. 이를 통해 데이터 손실을 방지할 수 있습니다. 저장소 장치를 설정한 후 YaST Uyuni 설정 절차를 실행해야 합니다. Uyuni에 필요한 3가지 다른 볼륨: 데이터베이스 볼륨: /var/lib/pgsql 채널 볼륨: /var/spacewalk 캐시: /var/cache 모든 볼륨의 파일 시스템 형식으로는 XFS를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 또한, 온프레미스 설치의 경우 논리적 볼륨 관리(LVM)를 사용하여 디스크를 관리할 수 있습니다. 리포지토리 저장소의 디스크 크기는 Uyuni를 사용하여 관리한 배포 및 채널의 수에 따라 다릅니다. 필요한 예상 크기에 대한 설명은 이 섹션의 테이블을 참조하십시오. Uyuni 서버에서 이 명령을 사용하여 사용할 수 있는 모든 저장소 장치를 찾습니다. hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"장치 파일:\" lsblk 명령을 사용하여 각 장치의 이름 및 크기를 확인합니다. 장치 이름과 함께 suma-storage 명령을 사용하여 외부 디스크를 데이터베이스 및 리포지토리의 위치로 설정합니다. suma-storage [] 외부 저장소 볼륨은 /manager_storage 및 /pgsql_storage에 마운트된 XFS 파티션으로 설정됩니다. 채널 데이터 및 데이터베이스 모두에서 동일한 저장소 장치를 사용할 수 있습니다. 채널 리포지토리가 증가하여 저장소가 가득 차 데이터베이스 무결성이 손상될 수 있으므로 이 방법은 권장되지 않습니다. 별도의 저장소 장치를 사용하면 성능도 향상할 수 있습니다. 1개의 저장소 장치를 사용하려면 단일 장치 이름 파라미터와 함께 suma-storage를 실행합니다. 프록시를 설치하는 경우에는 suma-storage 명령에서 단일 장치 이름 파라미터만 사용할 수 있고 외부 저장소 위치가 Squid 캐시로 설정됩니다. Uyuni 서버 및 프록시에 대한 디스크 파티션을 생성할 때는 권한을 올바르게 설정했는지 확인하십시오. /var/lib/pgsql의 경우: 소유자: 읽기, 쓰기, 실행 그룹: 읽기, 실행 사용자: 없음 /var/spacewalk의 경우: 소유자: 읽기, 쓰기, 실행 그룹: 읽기, 쓰기, 실행 사용자: 읽기, 실행 다음 명령으로 권한 확인: ls -l /var/lib/pgsql /var/spacewalk 출력은 다음과 같아야 합니다. drwxr-x--- 1 postgres postgres /var/lib/pgsql drwxrwxr-x 1 wwwrun www /var/spacewalk 필요한 경우, 다음 명령으로 권한 변경: chmod 750 /var/lib/pgsql chmod 775 /var/spacewalk 그리고 다음으로 소유자 변경: chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql chown wwwrun:www /var/spacewalk","title":"하드웨어 요구사항","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 서버 하드웨어 요구사항","hash":"server-hardware-requirements","id":1},{"text":"2. 프록시 하드웨어 요구사항","hash":"_프록시_하드웨어_요구사항","id":2},{"text":"3. 저장소 장치 및 권한","hash":"_저장소_장치_및_권한","id":3}]},"165":{"id":165,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 시스템 요구사항 2.

Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure에서 이러한 지침을 테스트했지만 약간의 차이는 있지만 다른 공급자에서도 작동해야 합니다. 시작하기 전 고려해야 할 사항은 다음과 같습니다. Uyuni 설정 절차는 정방향 확인 된 역방향 DNS 조회를 수행합니다. 설정 절차를 완료하고 Uyuni이 예상대로 작동하려면 이 작업이 성공해야 합니다. Uyuni을(를) 설정하기 전에 호스트 이름 및 IP 구성을 수행하는 것이 중요합니다. Uyuni 서버 및 프록시 인스턴스는 DNS 항목을 관리할 수 있는 네트워크 구성에서 실행해야 하지만 인터넷에서 전체적으로 액세스할 수 없습니다. 이 네트워크 구성에서는 DNS 확인이 제공되어야 합니다. hostname -f에서 FQDN(정규화된 도메인 이름)을 반환해야 합니다. DNS 확인은 클라이언트 연결에도 중요합니다. DNS는 선택한 클라우드 프레임워크와 독립적입니다. 자세한 지침은 클라우드 공급자의 설명서를 참조하십시오. 외부 가상 디스크에서 소프트웨어 리포지토리, 서버 데이터베이스 및 프록시 squid 캐시를 찾는 것이 좋습니다. 이를 수행하면 인스턴스가 예기치 않게 종료되는 경우 데이터 손실을 방지할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에는 외부 가상 디스크를 설정하기 위한 지침이 포함되어 있습니다. 기존 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하려면 클라이언트에 로그인한 상태에서 서버의 호스트 이름을 확인할 수 있는지 확인하십시오. 서버의 FQDN을 클라이언트의 /etc/hosts 로컬 확인 파일에 추가해야 할 수도 있습니다. 서버의 로컬 IP 주소가 포함된 hostname -f 명령을 사용하여 확인할 수 있습니다. 공용 클라우드에서 Uyuni을(를) 사용하는 경우 제한 네트워크를 사용해야 합니다. 방화벽이 올바르게 설정된 VPC 개인 서브넷을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 지정된 IP 범위의 시스템만 인스턴스에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 공용 클라우드에서 Uyuni을(를) 실행하는 경우에는 인스턴스에 대한 액세스를 제한하는 보안 조치를 적용해야 합니다. 전 세계에서 액세스할 수 있는 Uyuni 인스턴스는 Uyuni EULA 규정을 위반하며 SUSE에서 지원하지 않습니다. Uyuni Web UI에 액세스하려면, 네트워크 액세스 제어를 구성할 때 HTTPS를 허용하십시오. 이렇게 하면 Uyuni Web UI에 액세스할 수 있습니다. EC2 및 Azure에서 새 보안 그룹을 만들고 HTTPS에 대한 인바운드 및 아웃바운드 규칙을 추가합니다. GCE에서 방화벽 섹션 아래의 HTTPS 트래픽 허용 상자를 선택합니다. Uyuni용 리포지토리와 데이터베이스는 루트 볼륨에 대한 별도의 저장소 장치에 저장하는 것이 좋습니다. 이렇게 하면 데이터 손실을 방지할 수 있습니다. 공용 클라우드 설치에서는 LVM(논리적 볼륨 관리)을 사용하지 마십시오. YaST Uyuni 설정 절차를 실행하기 전에 저장소 장치를 설정해야 합니다. 리포지토리 저장소를 위한 디스크 크기는 Uyuni(으)로 관리할 배포 및 채널 수에 따라 다릅니다. 가상 디스크를 연결하면 인스턴스에 Unix 장치 노드로 표시됩니다. 장치 노드의 이름은 공급자 및 선택한 인스턴스 유형에 따라 다릅니다. Uyuni 서버의 루트 볼륨이 100GB 이상인지 확인합니다. 500GB 이상의 추가 저장소 디스크를 추가하고 가능하면 SSD 저장소를 선택하십시오. Uyuni 서버의 클라우드 이미지는 인스턴스가 시작될 때 스크립트를 사용하여 별도의 볼륨을 할당합니다. 인스턴스를 시작할 때 Uyuni 서버에 로그인하고 이 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 모든 저장소 장치를 찾을 수 있습니다. hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"장치 파일:\" 선택해야 할 장치가 확실하지 않은 경우 lsblk 명령을 사용하여 각 장치의 이름과 크기를 확인하십시오. 찾고 있는 가상 디스크의 크기와 일치하는 이름을 선택하십시오. suma-storage 명령어로 외부 디스크를 설정할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면/manager_storage에 마운트된 XFS 파티션이 생성되고 이를 데이터베이스 및 리포지토리의 위치로 사용합니다. /usr/bin/suma-storage","title":"공용 클라우드 요구사항","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"pubcloud-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/pubcloud-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 네트워크 요구사항","hash":"_네트워크_요구사항","id":1},{"text":"2. 스토리지 볼륨 준비","hash":"_스토리지_볼륨_준비","id":2}]},"188":{"id":188,"text":"Table of Contents 1. 공용 클라우드 모듈 활성화 2.

Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_4 \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see openSUSE Leap 클라이언트 등록. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[]. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see 부트스트랩 스크립트로 클라이언트 등록. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL 인증서. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see 네트워크를 통한 설치(PXE 부팅). Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Manager 프록시 설정. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

Register the openSUSE Leap system 3. Install Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap 4. Prepare the Proxy 5. Set Up the Proxy 6. Configure DHCP for PXE through Proxy 7. Reinstalling a Proxy 8. More Information Uyuni Proxy can be installed as a server extension on openSUSE Leap. The proxy is installed in the same way as a client, but is designated as a proxy server during installation. This is achieved by adding the Uyuni Proxy pattern, and executing the proxy setup script. For more information about the stable version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/stable-version.html. For more information about the development version of Uyuni, see https://www.uyuni-project.org/pages/devel-version.html. The Uyuni Proxy software is available from https://download.opensuse.org. You can synchronize the proxy software to your Uyuni Server. This process is also known as mirroring. Procedure: Mirroring Uyuni Proxy software On the Uyuni Server, create openSUSE Leap and the Uyuni Proxy channels with the spacewalk-common-channels command. spacewalk-common-channels is part of the spacewalk-utils package: spacewalk-common-channels \\ opensuse_leap15_4 \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss \\ opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates \\ opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client \\ uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 Instead of the uyuni-proxy-stable-leap-154 version you can also try the latest development version, called uyuni-proxy-devel-leap. For more information, see openSUSE Leap 클라이언트 등록. Begin by installing openSUSE Leap on a physical or virtual machine. To ensure that the proxy is accessible across the network, you must have a resolvable fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the openSUSE Leap system before you begin the installation. You can configure an FQDN with YaST by navigating to System Network Settings Hostname/DNS. When you have installed openSUSE Leap on the proxy and configured the FQDN, you can prepare the Uyuni Server, and register the openSUSE Leap system as a client. Procedure: Registering the openSUSE Leap system On the Uyuni Server, create an activation key with openSUSE Leap as a base channel and the proxy and the other channels as child channels. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. Modify a bootstrap script for the proxy. Ensure you add the GPG key for Uyuni to the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter. For example: ORG_GPG_KEY=uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key For more information, see xref:client-configuration:clients-opensuse.adoc[]. Bootstrap the client using the script. For more information, see 부트스트랩 스크립트로 클라이언트 등록. Navigate to Salt Keys and accept the key. When the key is accepted, the new proxy will show in Systems Overview in the Recently Registered Systems section. Navigate to System Details Software Software Channels, and check that the proxy channel is selected. On the client, use the zypper command line tool or on the Uyuni Server, the Web UI to install the proxy software on openSUSE Leap. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Proxy on openSUSE Leap Install the pattern for the Uyuni Proxy. You can do this either on the client or on the server. For the client, use zypper zypper in patterns-uyuni_proxy Alternatively, on the Uyuni Server, use the Web UI. Navigate to the details tab of the client, click Software Packages Install, and schedule patterns-uyuni_proxy for installation. Reboot the client. Before you begin, ensure that the proxy pattern is installed correctly. To verify a successful installation, on the Uyuni Server, select the pattern_uyuni_proxy package for installation. The salt-broker service is automatically started after installation is complete. This service forwards the Salt interactions to the Uyuni Server. It is possible to arrange Salt proxies in a chain. In this case, the upstream proxy is named parent. Make sure the TCP ports 4505 and 4506 are open on the proxy. The proxy must be able to reach the Uyuni Server or a parent proxy on these ports. The proxy shares some SSL information with the Uyuni Server. You need to copy the certificate and its key from the Uyuni Server or the parent proxy to the proxy you are setting up. Procedure: Copying the Server Certificate and Key On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the certificate and key: mkdir -m 700 /root/ssl-build cd /root/ssl-build Copy the certificate and the key from the source to the new directory. In this example, the source location is called PARENT. Replace this with the correct path: scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-PRIVATE-SSL-KEY . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT . scp root@:/root/ssl-build/rhn-ca-openssl.cnf . To keep the security chain intact, the Uyuni Proxy functionality requires the SSL certificate to be signed by the same CA as the Uyuni Server certificate. Using certificates signed by different CAs for proxies and server is not supported. For more information on how Uyuni handles certificates, see SSL 인증서. When you have prepared the proxy, use the supplied interactive configure-proxy.sh script to complete the proxy setup. Procedure: Setting up the Proxy On the proxy you are setting up, at the command prompt, as root, execute the setup script: configure-proxy.sh Follow the prompts to set up the proxy. Leave a field blank and type Enter to use the default values shown between square brackets. More information about the settings set by the script: Uyuni Parent the Uyuni parent can be either another proxy or a server. HTTP Proxy A HTTP proxy enables your Uyuni Proxy to access the Web. This is needed if direct access to the Web is prohibited by a firewall. Traceback Email An email address where to report problems. Do You Want to Import Existing Certificates? Answer N. This ensures using the new certificates that were copied previously from the Uyuni server. Organization The next questions are about the characteristics to use for the SSL certificate of the proxy. The organization might be the same organization that was used on the server, unless of course your proxy is not in the same organization as your main server. Organization Unit The default value here is the proxy’s hostname. City Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. State Further information attached to the proxy’s certificate. Country Code In the country code field, enter the country code set during the Uyuni installation. For example, if your proxy is in the US and your Uyuni is in DE, enter DE for the proxy. The country code must be two upper case letters. For a complete list of country codes, see https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search. Cname Aliases (Separated by Space) Use this if your proxy can be accessed through various DNS CNAME aliases. Otherwise it can be left empty. CA Password Enter the password that was used for the certificate of your Uyuni Server. Do You Want to Use an Existing SSH Key for Proxying SSH-Push Salt Minion? Use this option if you want to reuse a SSH key that was used for SSH-Push Salt clients on the server. Create and Populate Configuration Channel rhn_proxy_config_1000010001? Accept default Y. SUSE Manager Username Use same user name and password as on the Uyuni server. If parts are missing, such as CA key and public certificate, the script prints commands that you must execute to integrate the needed files. When the mandatory files are copied, run configure-proxy.sh again. If you receive an HTTP error during script execution, run the script again. configure-proxy.sh activates services required by Uyuni Proxy, such as squid, apache2, salt-broker, and jabberd. To check the status of the proxy system and its clients, click the proxy system’s details page on the Web UI (Systems System List Proxy, then the system name). Connection and Proxy subtabs display various status information. If you want to PXE boot your clients from your Uyuni Proxy, you also need to synchronize the TFTP data from the Uyuni Server. For more information about this synchronization, see 네트워크를 통한 설치(PXE 부팅). Procedure: Synchronizing Profiles and System Information On the proxy, at the command prompt, as root, install the susemanager-tftpsync-recv package: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync-recv On the proxy, run the configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh You need to provide the hostname and IP address of the Uyuni Server and the proxy. You also need to enter the path to the tftpboot directory on the proxy. On the server, at the command prompt, as root, install susemanager-tftpsync: zypper in susemanager-tftpsync On the server, run configure-tftpsync.sh setup script and enter the requested information: configure-tftpsync.sh Run the script again with the fully qualified domain name of the proxy you are setting up. This creates the configuration, and uploads it to the Uyuni Proxy: configure-tftpsync.sh FQDN_of_Proxy On the server, start an initial synchronization: cobbler sync You can also synchronize after a change within Cobbler that needs to be synchronized immediately. Otherwise Cobbler synchronization will run automatically when needed. For more information about PXE booting, see Install via the Network. Uyuni uses Cobbler for client provisioning. PXE (tftp) is installed and activated by default. Clients must be able to find the PXE boot on the Uyuni Proxy using DHCP. Use this DHCP configuration for the zone which contains the clients to be provisioned: next-server: filename: \"pxelinux.0\" A proxy does not contain any information about the clients that are connected to it. Therefore, a proxy can be replaced by a new one at any time. The replacement proxy must have the same name and IP address as its predecessor. For more information about reinstalling a proxy, see SUSE Manager 프록시 설정. Proxy systems are registered as Salt clients using a bootstrap script. This procedure describes software channel setup and registering the installed proxy with an activation key as the Uyuni client. Before you can select the correct child channels while creating the activation key, ensure you have properly synchronized the openSUSE Leap channel with all the needed child channels and the Uyuni Proxy channel.

SUSE Customer Center (SCC) maintains a collection of repositories which contain packages, software and updates for all supported enterprise client systems. These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads. You will find your organization credentials in https://scc.suse.com/organizations. Enter your organization credentials in the Uyuni Web UI: Optional Procedure: Entering Organization Credentials In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Setup Wizard page, navigate to the Organization Credentials tab. Click Add a new credential. Enter a username and password, and click Save. A check mark icon is shown when the credentials are confirmed. When you have successfully entered the new credentials, you can synchronize with SUSE Customer Center. Optional Procedure: Synchronizing with SUSE Customer Center In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. From the Setup Wizard page select the SUSE Products tab. Wait a moment for the products list to populate. If you previously registered with SUSE Customer Center a list of products will populate the table. This table lists architecture, channels, and status information. If your SUSE Linux Enterprise client is based on x86_64 architecture scroll down the page and select the check box for this channel now. Add channels to Uyuni by selecting the check box to the left of each channel. Click the arrow symbol to the left of the description to unfold a product and list available modules. Click Add Products to start product synchronization. When a channel is added, Uyuni will schedule the channel for synchronization. Depending on the number and size of this channels, this can take a long time. You can monitor synchronization progress in the Web UI. For more information about using the setup wizard, see Wizard. When the channel synchronization process is complete, you can register and configure clients.

To get started, install the mgr-actions-control tool on the Uyuni Server, and use it to enable configuration management for your organization. Use the mgr-actions-control tool to enable and disable configuration management on a client. Actions that can be performed with mgr-actions-control include: Deploy a configuration file on a client Upload a file from the client Compare the configuration tools available on a client, with what is being used Run remote commands You must be logged in to Uyuni with an administrator account to use mgr-actions-control. This tool works by adding or removing files and directories on the client in the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/allowed-actions/ directory. By default, this directory requires root permissions. The available options for mgr-actions-control are listed in this table. Use this syntax for mgr-actions-control commands: mgr-actions-control [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option] Table 2.

For more information about the available options for the mgr-actions-control tool, see the man page: man mgr-actions-control Use the mgrcfg-client tool to manage configuration on a client. The mgrcfg-client has these primary modes: list get channels diff verify The available commands and arguments for mgrcfg-client are listed in this section. Use this syntax for mgrcfg-client commands: mgrcfg-client [-h] [--version] [-v] [--option] [mode] The list mode lists the configuration files for the client, including the labels of the configuration channels containing them. To see a complete list of all the configuration files that are currently applied to the client, use this command: mgrcfg-client list The output looks like this: DoFoS Config Channel File F config-channel-17 /etc/config-file F config-channel-17 /var/spool/aalib.rpm F config-channel-14 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf In this output, DoFoS means Directory, File, or Something else. Each entry in the output will be marked with D, F, or S. These configuration files apply to the client. Get more detail about a channel by specifying the channel name: mgrcfg-client list config-channel-14 The output looks like this: Files in config channel 'config-channel-14' /etc/config-file /etc/rhn/rhn.conf It is possible that there are duplicate configuration files in different channels. In this case, the file listing for the channel shows files that are not present when listing channels applied to the client. This is a result of file ranking, which means that channels can contain files that are not applied to the client, because they are outranked by a different file from a different channel. The get mode displays the contents of the primary configuration file for the client. To see the configuration file with the highest rank within the channel, use this command: mgrcfg-client get To see a specific configuration file, use this command: mgrcfg-client get The available options for mgrcfg-client get are listed in this table.

Comparing containerized and non-containerized workflows 5. Validating saltboot group configuration To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server 4.3 or newer one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized Uyuni for Retail environment does not use Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using Uyuni Server 4.3 or newer. Older images will not work. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configure DHCP for PXE booting. See DHCPd Formula how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server. Without using DHCP formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. See below for example. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Follow guide 시스템 그룹 to create the system groups: TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 First group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. Second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. Third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. We assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. With this, our branch group is converted to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot Groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. See Terminal Names for explanation of possible configurations. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server 4.3 where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is build and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Non-Containerized workflow: Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with what parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Saltboot Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Image Synchronizing to the Branch Server If you have very large images that you need to synchronize to the branch server, you can use delta images to save network bandwidth. A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be - and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar file in /srv/susemanager/pillar_data/images/. Performance tuning is possible with the -B option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once 2. Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains 3. Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot 4. Configure the Server to Auto-Accept You can configure Uyuni to automatically accept the keys of newly deployed terminals. This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Send Auto-Signed Grain Once On the branch server, create a configuration file called /etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key At the command prompt, add the new configuration file to the existing initrd: echo ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf | / cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 11/12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 11 and SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the element, add: Save the file and rebuild the image. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot Configure the PXE formula to specify these kernel parameters during booting: SALT_AUTOSIGN_GRAINS=autosign_key: PXE boot the Salt client. The formula creates the ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf configuration file and passes it to initrd. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept On the Uyuni Server, open the master configuration file in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, and add or edit this line: autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot: For multiple keys, put each one on a new line.

Use Multiple Wireless Networks If you are not able to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deploy Terminals. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if= of= When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. Build the image. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID= WIRELESS_WPA_PSK= - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Deploy Images to the Terminals 5. Re-Deploy Images to the Terminals 6. Customize the Terminal Image Download Process When you have the Uyuni Server and Branch Server set up, you are ready to deploy point-of-service terminals by following these steps: Create hardware type groups Assign and configure the Saltboot formula for each hardware type group Synchronize images to the branch server Deploy images to the terminals Each procedure is detailed in this section. For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. For Uyuni 4.2 and later, terminals can be either x86-64 or ARM64 architecture. For earlier versions, terminals must be x86 architecture only. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync If you have 32-bit machines included in your branch, then you must use a 32-bit boot image as a default boot image. If a 32-bit boot image is not used as a default boot image, 32-bit terminals will be unable to boot and operate properly. Check the available boot images and their architecture from the command line: salt pillar.item boot_images Output: POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0: ---------- arch: x86_64 ... legacy-6.0.0: ---------- arch: i686 In this example, the legacy-6.0.0 boot image is 32-bit. You can set the default boot image in the Image Synchronization formula on the branch server, by adding the chosen boot image name to the Default boot image field. For more information about Image Synchronization formula, see Image Synchronization Formula. When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can instruct terminals to download and deploy images when they are restarted. This is achieved using a Salt state. Procedure: Forcing a Terminal to Re-Deploy Images On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, apply this Salt state: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_redeploy Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. If your terminal encounters a problem with the file system or the partition table, you might need to remove the partition table and reformat the terminal. Re-partitioning a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions. Procedure: Forcing a Terminal to Re-partition the Hard Disk On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, apply this Salt state: salt $terminal_minion_id state.apply saltboot.force_repartition Restart the terminal to pick up the changes. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. /srv/pillar/top.sls 파일 편집: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Edit the /srv/pillar/saltboot_proto.sls file: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server. /srv/pillar/top.sls 파일 편집: base: 'minion_id_prefix:$branch_prefix': - match: grain - $branch_prefix Edit the /srv/pillar/$branch_prefix.sls file: saltboot_download_server: $download_server_fqdn In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin.","title":"Deploy Terminals","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Partitioning and Image Deployment Formula Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your Uyuni for Retail installation. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to apply common Uyuni formulas. For the most commonly used formulas, see Salt Formulas. All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. If you are unsure of the correct formula configuration details, run the retail_branch_init command before you begin to create the recommended formula configuration. You can then manually edit the formulas as required. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula VSFTP formula, see VsFTPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services. Use the Saltboot formula to specify disk partitioning, and to select which image should be deployed. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula.","title":"Introduction to Retail Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-formulas-intro","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-formulas-intro.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Synchronize Images to the Branch Server To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail branch server proxies, or containerized proxy one or more Uyuni build hosts This section covers how to configure your Uyuni for Retail environment, including: Prepare POS images Prepare system groups Configure services for Saltboot Synchronize POS images to the branch servers The very first time you set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to perform all configuration steps. You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. SLES 11 reached end of life and is no longer supported and can stop working at any moment. POS Terminals based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP 3 can be deployed in much the same way as other terminals, with a few differences. You must use the SLES 11 template SLES 11 images need to be activated with the SLES11 SP3 i586 and SLEPOS 11 SP3 i586 channels Ensure that SLES 11 images are built on the SLES 11 build host. Building on the incorrect build host will cause your build to fail. If you are building images for SLES 11 using profiles from an HTTPS git repository that uses TLS 1.0 or greater, it will fail. SLES 11 does not support later versions of TLS. You will need to clone the repository locally to use it for building. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deploy Terminals. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 시스템 그룹에 대한 자세한 내용은 시스템 그룹에서 확인할 수 있습니다. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see Prometheus 및 Grafana를 사용한 모니터링. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible 통합. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server ; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server ; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deploy Terminals. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly. For more information about Image Synchronization Formula, see Image Synchronization Formula.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch Server Mass Configuration 1.1. Configure Multiple Branch Servers 2. Terminal Mass Configuration 2.1. Configure Multiple Terminals 3. Export Configuration to Mass Configuration File Mass configuration is possible with branch servers and terminals. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Migration with Complete Data Dump 2. Migration with Branch by Branch Data Dump 3. Converting XML to YAML This section describes migrating from an existing SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service 11 installation to a new Uyuni installation. You can perform this migration all at once by creating a data dump in a single file, and then moving it to the new server. Alternatively, you can perform the migration in stages by creating a data dump for each branch, and moving them to the new server one by one. Importing and deploying the converted data can also be done in one or multiple steps, depending on your environment. In this procedure, you create a single data dump in an XML file, convert it to YAML, and migrate it to the new infrastructure all at once. Install the Uyuni for Retail server 2023.02. For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. On the SLEPOS Admin server export all the data stored in LDAP to an XML file. Run this command as an administrator: posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml The resulting dumpfile.xml file will contain global information, with parts about images, hardware and its partitioning, and the description of the branch servers with networking data, services, and attached terminals. Move the XML file to the newly created Uyuni server, and convert it to YAML: retail_migration dumpfile.xml retail.yml Review the generated YAML file (retail.yml) and adjust it as necessary. Consider HWTYPE group naming and image name and version changes in the partitioning data. Group names must not exceed the 56 character limit. You can shorten the names as needed, and the image names must match the images in Uyuni. The --save-mapping option can help you with this task. Also check whether there are duplicate MAC addresses of the terminals in the generated YAML file. Choose which entry you want to keep. If there are duplicate MAC addresses, importing the YAML file will fail. SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service images will not be migrated. You must rebuild the images using the OS image building functionality. For more information about building images, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Import the complete data (YAML) with: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yml You can see statistical data while the import is in progress. Check the results in the Web UI by navigating to Systems System List All and find empty profiles. To see the groups for the hardware configuration, branches, servers, and terminals, navigate to Systems Groups. To finalize the branch server migration, you must install the branch server machines as Salt clients and bootstrap them as proxies. For more information about proxy installation, see Retail Installation. For more information about using an activation key to assign the required channels, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. After onboarded to Uyuni, the branch servers machines are connected with the empty profiles (by FQDN), and so they will get the Retail configuration. After all the branches are migrated, shutdown and remove the old SLEPOS Admin Server. In this procedure, you migrate the SLEPOS infrastructure and the branches one by one, first exporting and then importing. Install the Uyuni for Retail server 2023.02 For more information, see Install with the Unified Installer. On every branch server: posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml These dumps will contain only the LDAP data of the branch, and any global data. Similarily, you can export the LDAP data of every branch if you run the command on the Admin server with the branch credentials explicitly specified: posAdmin --export --type xml --file dumpfile.xml --user $branch_dn \\ --password $password For background information about SLEPOS branch server configuration, see https://documentation.suse.com/sle-pos/11-SP3/html/SLEPOS-guide/cha.slepos_branchserv.html. Review the generated YAML file (retail.yml) and adjust it as necessary. Consider HWTYPE group naming and image name and version changes in the partitioning data. You can shorten the names as needed, and the image names must match the images in Uyuni. The --save-mapping option can help you with this task. Check whether there are duplicate MAC addresses of the terminals in the generated YAML file. Choose which entry you want to keep. As long as there are duplicate MAC addresses, Uyuni will refuse importing the YAML file. SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service images will not be migrated. You must rebuild the images using the OS image building functionality. For more information about building images, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. The data can be imported branch by branch. For each branch perform the following steps: Run the import command for one branch after the other: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yml --branch Repeat the command for every branch. To finalize each branch server migration, you must install the branch server machine as a Salt-based client and bootstrap it as a proxy. For more information about proxy installation, see Installing and Registering. For more information about using an activation key to assign the required channels, see Configuring Server. After onboarded to Uyuni for Retail, the branch server machine is connected with the empty profile (by FQDN), and so it will get the Retail configuration. Apply Highstate on the branch server; this will happen automatically if Configuration File Deployment is enabled. Boot the terminals of the branch. After all the branches are migrated, shut down and remove the old SLEPOS Admin Server. When you perform a migration using one of the methods in this chapter, one of the steps takes the XML data dump file from SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service, and converts it to a YAML file for Uyuni for Retail. The tool that performs this conversion has additional features, which are outlined in this section. To validate the XML file before conversion, and print any errors: retail_migration dumpfile.xml To write a mapping file called map.yml: retail_migration dumpfile.xml --save-mapping map.yml The mapping file contains two dictionaries: images, which maps old SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service images to new images built in Uyuni. groups, which maps legacy SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service scCashRegister objects to Uyuni HWTYPE groups. Group names must not exceed the 56 character limit. The mapping file should be edited as required for your environment. To perform a conversion using a mapping file: retail_migration dumpfile.xml retail.yml --mapping map.yml If you are performing a branch-by-branch migration, the resulting retail.yml file will contain a new version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service LDAP data. If you want to preserve any global changes in your Uyuni for Retail settings, remove the global hardware types from the resulting retail.yml file before importing it. Alternatively, you can import retail.yml using this command to import only the new systems and groups defined in the file, and leave any existing configuration settings untouched: retail_yaml --only-new","title":"Migrate SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service 11 to Uyuni for Retail","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-migration-slepostosuma","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-migration-slepostosuma.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The second layer contains one or more branch servers to provide local network and boot services. It also contains one or more build hosts. The final layer contains any number of deployed point-of-service terminals. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see openSUSE Leap을 사용한 Uyuni 프록시 설치. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements. The branch servers are in the same network as the Uyuni Server, and terminals use an isolated branch network. In this configuration, the branch servers are in the corporate network, and provide all DHCP, DNS, PXE, FTP, and TFTP services to the terminals in the branch networks. The branch servers are in separate branch networks, along with the terminals they manage.

Cached Terminal Updates If the Uyuni Server is offline, you can still perform some operations on the terminals. This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded. When the terminal is rebooted and an uptodate POS image is found in the service partition, the terminal will automatically use this cached image for system redeployment.","title":"Offline Use","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-offline","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-offline.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for other purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. This guide provides an overview of Uyuni for Retail, and its initial installation and setup.

Prepare to Migrate from SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service This document is intended to guide you through migration your SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service or older Uyuni for Retail installation (3.1 or 3.2) to the newest version of Uyuni for Retail. This document is divided into scenarios. Pick the scenario that best suits your environment, and follow the instructions in that section to migrate your installation. Ensure your existing installation is fully updated, and that you have performed a backup, before you begin your migration. SUSE Linux Enterprise Point of Service cannot be upgraded directly to Uyuni for Retail. The migration requires you to perform some manual configuration. To assist you in the migration, as much information as possible about the existing hardware configuration and network infrastructure is recorded. Then this information is used for rebuilding the new Uyuni for Retail installation. In some cases, this will require a lengthy downtime to perform the migration. If you are not able to manage downtime, you can install new servers and run them in parallel to the existing ones while you perform the migration. This is especially relevant for large installations. It is possible to run a SLEPOS Admin server and Uyuni Server in parallel. In such a scenario, branches that have been migrated will run on the Uyuni server, while those that have not yet been migrated can continue to run on the SLEPOS Admin server. This includes all operations, such as adding new terminals, or building and deploying new images. However, if you run network services (especially DHCP) on the branch servers, you will not be able to run both old and new branch servers in parallel on the same branch, because they can conflict with each other. This can result in multiple terminals having the same IP address, or terminals randomly assigned to different branch servers. If you need to migrate in this environment, and you want to configure a new branch server while the branch is still running on old infrastructure, make sure that the new branch server is not connected to the network with the terminals. If your branch server does not provide DHCP services, you can configure the new one in parallel and, when you are ready, change the configuration of your DHCP server from the old to the new branch server.","title":"Before You Migrate","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-prepare-migration","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-prepare-migration.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 예는 다음과 같습니다. B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can configure this value in the Branch Network Formula settings for the branch server. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the salt client ID checkbox in the Branch Network Formula. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: hwAddress: hwtype: Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. For more information about using YAML configuration files, see Mass Configuration.","title":"Terminal Names","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-terminal-names","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-terminal-names.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE 채널은 규모가 매우 클 수 있습니다. 때로 동기화에 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. 프로시저: 클라이언트의 GPG 키 신뢰 On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. 관련 부트스트랩 스크립트를 열어 ORG_GPG_KEY= 파라미터를 찾고 필요한 키를 추가합니다. 예: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. . If you are bootstrapping clients from the {productname} {webui}, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.4 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.4 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.4 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) For more information about creating activation keys, see 활성화 키. You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels 클라이언트 등록에 대한 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 참조하십시오. A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see 프록시 등록. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.4 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script.

The GPG key URL parameter in the software channel page can contain multiple key URLs separated by \"whitespace\". In case it is a file URL, the GPG key file must be deployed on the client before the software channel is used. The GPG keys for the Client Tools Channels of Red Hat based clients are deployed on the client into /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ and can be referenced with file URLs. Only in case a software channel is assigned to the client they will be imported and trusted by the system.

Configuration Channel Details Uyuni manages both central and local configuration channels and files. Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems, and is available for both traditional and Salt clients. For traditional clients, use local configuration management. Local configuration management allows you to specify overrides, and select configuration files that are not changed when the system is subscribed to a central channel. For Salt clients, use state channels. When you create a state channel, you can create or upload custom Salt states. For more information about custom Salt states, see Custom Salt States. Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel. If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the List/Remove Files page of that channel. If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the Configuration Channel Details Systems Subscribed Systems page for that channel. 개요 The Overview page of the Configuration Channel Details page is divided into several panels: Channel Properties [Management] Edit the name, label, and description of the channel by clicking Edit Properties. Channel Information Provides status information for the contents of the channel. Configuration Actions Provides access to the most common configuration tasks. For Salt clients, there is a link to edit the init.sls file. This panel allows you to deploy, compare, and add and create files. Some action are only availalble if you have files created and clients assigned to configuration channels. List/Remove Files This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel. You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels. Check the box next to files you want to manipulate, then click the action button at the bottom. Add Files The Add Files page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to Upload, Import, or Create configuration files to be included in the channel. Upload File To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the Upload Configuration File button. The Filename/Path field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed. You can set the Ownership via the user name and group name and the Permissions of the file when it is deployed. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure SELinux contexts to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type). If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro. For more information on using macros, see reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros. Import Files To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import. Then click Import Configuration Files. A sandbox icon () indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox. Files in a system’s sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable. Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel. Create File Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link to be included in the configuration channel. Deploy Files This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel. Deploy all files by clicking the Deploy All Files button or check selected files and click the Deploy Selected Files button. Select to which systems the files should be applied. All systems subscribed to this channel are listed. If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first. To deploy the files, click Confirm & Deploy to Selected Systems. 시스템 Manage systems subscribed to the configuration channel with two subtabs: Subscribed Systems All systems subscribed to the current channel are displayed.

Setup spacecmd Credentials 2. spacecmd Quiet Mode 3. spacecmd Help The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help ): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Spacecmd caching problems This section provides troubleshooting solutions when working with spacecmd The support article associated with this issue may be located at https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7018627 Situation When creating a distribution with spacecmd it will automatically set localhost as the server name instead of the FQDN of SUSE Manager. This will result in the following kernel option being written: install=http://localhost/ks/dist/ Resolution Set the FQDN in $HOME/.spacecmd/config like the following: test:~/.spacecmd # cat config [spacecmd] server=test.mytest.env username=admin password=password nossl=0 Cause This problem may be experienced if $HOME/.spacecmd/config has been created and the server name option was set to localhost. When running spacecmd non-interactively, you must escape arguments passed to the command. Always put -- before arguments, to avoid them being treated as global arguments. Additionally, make sure you escape any quotes that you pass to the functions so that they are not interpreted. An example of a well-formed spacecmd command: spacecmd -s server1 -- softwarechannel_create -n \\'My Channel\\' -l channel1 -a x86_64 The spacecmd command keeps a cache of the various systems and packages that you have installed. Sometimes, this can result in a mismatch between the system name and the system ID.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block//queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block//queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"481":{"id":481,"text":"Make sure the hub-xmlrpc-api service is started: systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api Once it is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Authentication Examples The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different authentication modes: Manual mode (default): API credentials must be explicitly provided for each server. Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python import xmlrpclib HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpclib.Server(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print (system) #logout client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2. Example Python Script for Relay Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python import xmlrpclib HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"\" HUB_USERNAME = \"\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"\" client = xmlrpclib.Server(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) #Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) #authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate) client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds) # perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print (system) #logout client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Auto-Connect Authentication Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers. However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. Listing 3.

The package is available in the Uyuni 2023.02 repositories. OPTIONAL: Set the Hub XMLRPC API service to start automatically at boot time, and start it immediately: sudo systemctl enable hub-xmlrpc-api.service sudo systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api.service OPTIONAL: Check that these parameters in the /etc/hub/hub.conf configuration file are correct: HUB_API_URL: URL to the Hub Server XMLRPC API endpoint. Use the default value if you are installing hub-xmlrpc-api on the Hub Server. HUB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when connecting to a Server. Use the default value in most cases. HUB_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when calling a Server method. Use the default value in most cases. HUB_CONNECT_USING_SSL: use HTTPS instead of HTTP for communicating with peripheral Servers. Recommended for a secure environment. Restart services to pick up configuration changes. To use HTTPS to connect to peripheral Servers, you must set the HUB_CONNECT_USING_SSL parameter to true, and ensure that the SSL certificates for all the peripheral Servers are installed on the machine where the hub-xmlrpc-api service runs.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"485":{"id":485,"text":"Table of Contents 1.

Tuning Reporting Jobs 4.2. report_db_batch_size 4.3. report_db_hub_workers The Hub prepares and provides content for multiple peripheral Uyuni Servers. The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Schema documentation can be found on the Left Navigation Bar → Help Report Database Schema. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Salt Client Onboarding Rate 2. Salt Clients and the RNG 3. Clients Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys 4. Disabling the Salt Mine 5. Disable Unnecessary Taskomatic jobs 6. Swap and Monitoring 7. AES Key Rotation This section contains a range of recommendations for large scale deployments. Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from Salt clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. There is no hard maximum number of supported systems. Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured. Large installations require standard Salt clients. These instructions cannot be used in environments using traditional clients or Salt SSH minions. There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

Memory Usage Uyuni is designed by default to work on small and medium scale installations. For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters. Description The maximum number of HTTP requests served simultaneously by Apache httpd. Proxies, Web UI, and XMLRPC API clients each consume one.

More information man rhn.conf Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. This parameter sets the amount of time before a second command (find_job) is sent to the client to verify its presence. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls.

Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count increases significantly (more than 50), or more concurrent operations on channels are expected.

If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving. Value default 20 Value recommendation 100 to 200, higher than the maximum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size + maxThreads and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example hibernate.c3p0.max_size = 100 After changing Check max_connections for adjustment. More information https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize Description The maximum amount of memory that the rhn-search service can use. Tune when Client count increases significantly, and OutOfMemoryException errors appear in journalctl -u rhn-search. Value default 512 MiB Value recommendation 512-4096 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example rhn-search.java.maxmemory = 4096 After changing Check memory usage.

More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation 2 * hibernate.c3p0.max_size + apache MaxClients + 70, if less than 1000 Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-200 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 50 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring your own subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pay as you go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in 공용 클라우드 요구사항. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete setup in the Uyuni Web UI.

You need to install the formulas on the Uyuni Server. When you have installed the package, you can use the Uyuni Web UI to enable and configure the formulas. As you go through the formula configuration process, provide details of the clients that contain your SAP cluster, to set them up appropriately. To install the formulas on the Uyuni Server, use your package manager to install these packages: saphanabootstrap-formula sapnwbootstrap-formula drbd-formula habootstrap-formula salt-shaptools The order that you enable and configure the formulas is important.

Register Clients to the SUSE Customer Center 2. Configure the Clients for Clustering 3. Create a Shared Storage Device 4. Download the SAP Installation Software 5. Configure Clients to Use Latest module.run 6. Install Additional Disks for HANA 7. Register Clients to the Server Your SAP cluster requires several client systems. Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP2/html/SLES-SAP-quick/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware. For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 일반 요구사항. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. In the Activation Key field, select the SLES for SAP activation key.

General Targeting List available grains on all clients: salt '*' grains.ls Target a specific client: salt 'web1.example.com' test.ping Glob Targeting Target all clients using a particular domain: salt '*example.com' test.ping Target all clients using a particular label: salt 'label*' test.ping List Targeting Specify a flat list of clients, using their IDs: salt -L 'client_ID1, client_ID2, client_ID3' test.ping Regular Expression Targeting You can also define targets with PCRE-compliant regular expressions: salt -E '(?!web)' test.ping IP Address Targeting List available client IP addresses: salt '*' network.ip_addrs Target a specific client IP address: salt -S '172.31.60.74' test.ping Target all clients on a subnet: salt -S 172.31.0.0/16 test.ping For more on targeting, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/. When you have specified a target, provide the module and function to execute on the target. Find which modules can be executed on the target: salt '*' sys.doc For a full list of callable modules, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/index.html. Functions accept arguments for any extra data. For example, the pkg.install function requires an argument specifying which package to install: salt '*' pkg.install yast2 You can provide more than one argument to a function, with spaces between them.

Install Configuration Modules Salt uses execution and state modules to define, apply, and orchestrate configuration of your devices. Uyuni provides a set of modules called Uyuni configuration modules, that you can use to configure both SUSE Manager and Uyuni Servers. You can use the Uyuni configuration modules directly or using SLS files. They are are especially useful if you have multiple Uyuni Servers, for example in Hub installations, but they are also useful for smaller installations. For more information about using Hub, see Using Multiple Servers to Manage Large Scale Deployments.

Custom State to Trust a GPG Key 4. Apply a custom state at highstate You can create your own custom Salt states with Uyuni as centrally managed configuration channels. Custom states are stored as Salt state files on the Uyuni Server with a .sls extension. You can use the Uyuni Web UI to create and edit custom Salt state files. You must create a state channel first, with an initial state named init.sls. The init.sls file is used to reference all other state files within the channel. The custom states that you create using the Web UI are stored on the Uyuni Server in the the /srv/susemanager/salt// directory. After the channel is created with an init.sls file, you can write additional state files in the Web UI. Alternatively, you can upload existing state files to use within your state channel, or import them from other channels or clients. Procedure: Creating a Custom Salt Channel and Initial State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. In the Label field, type a label. Use alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. In the SLS Contents field, type the contents of your init.sls state. If you want to reference file templates in this configuration channel, ensure your file starts by specifying the source of the managed file, using this syntax: file.managed: - source: salt:////etc// Example custom state files are given later in this section. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. Procedure: Adding Additional Files to a Custom State Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. . Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click btn:Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit .sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2. Example: Package Management my_pkg_id: pkg.installed: - refresh: True - pkgs: - glibc - kernel-default - hello: 1.0-42 Listing 3. Example: Remote Command ip_forward-on: cmd.run: - name: echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - onlyif: - test `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 Listing 4. Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all SUSE public keys are also saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey- deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls. This short example maps the test state to the system group 12: # /srv/salt/top.sls base: 'group_ids:12': - match: pillar - test","title":"Custom Salt States","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-custom-states","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-custom-states.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolve saltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders. In the Configured Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.com). In the Type field, select master. Click Add item to add a second zone, and set these parameters for Zone 2: In the Name field, use the reverse zone for the configured IP range (for example: com.example.branch1).

Set Up a Branch Server Networking 1.1. Set Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN 1.2. Set up a Branch Server with a Shared Network 2. Set up Branch Server Terminal Naming The Branch Network formula is used to configure the networking services required by the branch server, including DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration it is required to fill at least Branch Identification. This identifies Branch Server in Retail subsystem and is also used to better organize terminals with their respective branch servers.

Saltboot Kernel Command Line Parameters The PXE formula is used to configure PXE booting on the branch server. Procedure: Configuring PXE Booting In the SUSE Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Pxe formula, and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Pxe tab, and set these parameters: In the Kernel Filename field, keep the default value. In the Initrd Filename field, keep the default value. If the terminals connecting to this branch server are running ARM64 architecture, check the Enable ARM64 UEFI boot box. Leave unchecked for x86-64. In the Kernel Filename for ARM64 field, keep the default value. In the Initrd Filename for ARM64 field, keep the default value. In the Kernel Command Line Parameters field, keep the default value. For more information about possible values, see Saltboot Kernel Command Line Parameters. In the PXE root directory field, enter the path to the saltboot directory (for example, /srv/saltboot). Click Save Formula to save your configuration. Apply the highstate. Saltboot supports common kernel parameters and saltboot-specific kernel parameters. All the parameters can be entered in the Kernel Command Line Parameters field of the PXE formula. kiwidebug=1 Starts a shell on tty2 during boot and enables debug logging in Salt. Do not use this parameter in a production environment as it creates a major security hole. This parameter should be used only in a development environment for debug purposes. MASTER Overrides auto-detection of the Salt master. For example: MASTER=myproxy.domain.com SALT_TIMEOUT Overrides the local boot fallback timeout if the Salt master does not apply the saltboot state within this timeout (default: 60 seconds). For example: SALT_TIMEOUT=300 DISABLE_HOSTNAME_ID If the terminal has a hostname assigned by DHCP, it is by default used as a minion ID. Setting this option to 1 disables this mechanism, and SMBios information will be used as a minion ID. DISABLE_UNIQUE_SUFFIX Setting this option to 1 disables adding random generated suffix to terminal minion ID. If you set this parameter make sure your terminal has either a unique hostname provided by DHCP and DNS, or the terminal hardware comes with a unique serial number stored in its SMBios memory. Otherwise there is a risk of terminal minion ID duplicity, and bootstrapping the minion will fail. The following parameters (MINION_ID_PREFIX, salt_device, root) are usually autoconfigured and should be used only in specific conditions such as debugging or development: MINION_ID_PREFIX Branch ID set in the Branch Network formula form. salt_device Device that contains the Salt configuration. root Device that contains the already deployed root file system.

The Saltboot formula helps you with setting up special partition types. For terminal to be able to boot locally, either BIOS grub or EFI partition must be configured. A BIOS grub partition is needed for local booting from a GPT disk on non-EFI machines. For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_boot_partition. In the formula, enter the following options: Partition Symbolic ID: p1 Partition Size (MiB): 50 Partition Flags: bios_grub Leave the other fields empty. An EFI partition is needed for local booting on EFI machines, Partition Table Type must be GPT. For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition. In the formula, enter the following options: Partition Symbolic ID: p1 Partition Size (MiB): 500 Device Mount Point: /boot/efi Filesystem Format: vfat Partition Flags: boot Leave the other fields empty. When there is only one disk present on target hardware (including USB drives), use an asterisk * to automatically select the disk device. When there are multiple disks, use an asterisk * in the device path. In this example, SATA disks are differentiated from USB disks: /dev/disk/by-path/*-ata-1 /dev/disk/by-path/*usb* If the entered value does not contain /, the entered value is automatically prepended by /dev/disk/by-path/. For example, *usb* is the same as /dev/disk/by-path/*usb*. If you prefer to select specific devices, you can this format in the disk device field: symbolic names (for example: /dev/sda) by-path (for example: /dev/disk/by-path/..) by-id (for example: /dev/disk/by-id/…​) To see a list of available devices from the command prompt, press Esc while waiting for key approval. msdos Disklabel Limitations On the msdos disk label, you can create a maximum of four primary partitions. Extended partitions are not supported. If you need more than four partitions, use the GPT disk label instead.

Expression language 3. Writing Salt Formulas 4. Separate Data 5. Generated Pillar Data You can also write your own custom formulas, and make them available to your clients in the Uyuni Web UI. This section contains information about writing custom formulas, including formulas with forms. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directoy also contains an optional metadata.yml file that contains additional information about a formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt// Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata// All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata//form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a : null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/suma_minion.py The process is executed like this: The suma_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (suma_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Throughout the Uyuni documentation, we use the term Salt clients to refer to Salt machines that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server.

Batching 2. Disabling the Salt Mine Salt is able to run commands in parallel on a large number of clients. This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.

Repository Access with a Proxy 11. Proxy Setup Salt SSH allows Salt commands and states to be issued directly over SSH. SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://suma-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the suma-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost suma-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to suma-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:suma-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to suma-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file= minion state.apply certs,` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time.","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see 사용자 정의 시스템 정보. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring. When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor. To use beacons on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Salt clients, install the python-pyinotify package. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, install the python-inotify package. For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are referred to as Salt clients, in order to clearly differentiate them from traditional clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step.

General Salt timeouts 2. Presence Ping Timeouts 3. Salt SSH Clients (SSH Push) Salt features two timeout parameters called timeout and gather_job_timeout that are relevant during the execution of Salt commands and jobs—​it does not matter whether they are triggered using the command line interface or API. These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (presence_ping_timeout/presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here.

Install the Yomi Formula 2. Install the PXE Image 3. Register Yomi in Cobbler 4. Example Salt Pillar Preparation 5. Monitor the Installation Yomi (yet one more installer) is an installer for SUSE and openSUSE operating systems. Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp:///pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
