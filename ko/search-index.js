© 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

To configure a client as the Ansible Control Node, the Ansible package must be installed on that system. Usually, the Ansible package should be obtained from the operating system vendor’s official repositories. For example, on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 and SP7, Ansible is available through the Systems Management Module. Procedure: Setting up Ansible Control Node on a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 or SP7 system In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard Products, verify that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP6 x86_64 (or later) with the Systems Management Module and the required Python 3 Module are selected and synchronized. Deploy a SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP6 (or later) client. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to the Systems Overview page of the client.

Uyuni Web UI에서 감사로 이동하여 감사 작업을 수행합니다. CVE(공통 취약점 및 노출)는 공개적으로 알려진 보안 취약점에 대한 수정입니다. 사용할 수 있게 된 즉시 CVE를 클라이언트에 적용해야 합니다. 각 CVE에는 식별 번호, 취약성에 대한 설명 및 추가 정보에 대한 링크가 포함되어 있습니다. CVE 식별 번호의 형식은 CVE-YEAR-XXXX입니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 감사 CVE 감사로 이동하여 모든 클라이언트 목록과 현재 패치 상태를 확인합니다. 기본적으로 패치 데이터는 매일 23:00시에 업데이트됩니다. 데이터를 새로 고쳐 최신 패치가 있는지 확인한 후 CVE 감사를 시작하는 것이 좋습니다. 절차: 패치 데이터 업데이트 Uyuni Web UI에서 관리자 작업 스케줄으로 이동하여 cve-server-channels-default 일정을 선택합니다. cve-server-channels-bunch를 클릭합니다. 단일 실행 일정을 클릭하여 작업을 예약합니다. 작업을 완료한 후 CVE 감사를 계속 진행합니다. 절차: 패치 상태 확인 Uyuni Web UI에서 감사 CVE 감사로 이동합니다. 특정 CVE의 패치 상태를 확인하려면 CVE 번호 필드에 CVE 식별자를 입력합니다. 찾을 패치 상태를 선택하거나 모든 상태를 확인하려면 모든 상태를 선택된 상태로 유지합니다. 서버 감사를 클릭하여 모든 시스템을 확인하거나 이미지 감사를 클릭하여 모든 이미지를 확인합니다. 이 페이지에서 사용되는 패치 상태 아이콘에 대한 자세한 내용은 CVE 감사에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 동작 열에서는 각 시스템에 대한 취약점을 해결하기 위해 수행해야 하는 작업에 대한 정보를 제공합니다. 해당하는 경우 후보 채널 또는 패치 목록도 제공됩니다. 추가적인 일괄 처리를 위해 시스템 세트에 시스템을 할당할 수도 있습니다. Uyuni API를 사용하여 클라이언트의 패치 상태를 확인할 수 있습니다. audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus API 메소드를 사용하면 됩니다. 이 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 Uyuni API 가이드에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 채널 데이터에서 CVE 정보를 검색하는 기능 외에도 Uyuni에는 이제 OVAL 파일에서 CVE 세부 사항을 가져오는 실험적 기능이 포함되어 있습니다. 이 기능은 현재 기술 미리보기로 간주됩니다. 사용자가 이 기능을 실험하고 피드백을 공유하는 것은 권장됩니다. 그러나 테스트 환경에서 철저하게 테스트하지 않고 프로덕션 환경에서 사용하는 것은 아직 권장되지 않습니다. CVE 감사 작업에서는 두 가지 주요 데이터 소스인 채널과 OVAL(개방형 취약성 및 평가 언어)을 활용합니다. 이 두 소스는 각각 다른 용도로 CVE 감사를 수행하기 위한 메타데이터를 제공합니다. 채널 채널에는 패치 등 업데이트된 소프트웨어 패키지가 포함되어 있으며, 취약점을 해결하는 데 필요한 필수 패치에 대한 정보를 제공합니다. OVAL(기술 미리보기) 반면에 OVAL 데이터는 취약점 자체에 대한 정보와 시스템이 CVE에 취약하도록 유발하는 패키지를 제공합니다. 채널 데이터만 사용하여 CVE 감사를 수행하는 것도 가능하지만, OVAL 데이터를 동기화하면 특히 제로데이 취약점이나 부분 패치 취약점과 관련된 경우 결과의 정확성을 향상할 수 있습니다. OVAL 데이터는 채널 데이터보다 훨씬 가볍습니다. 예를 들어, openSUSE Leap 15.4의 OVAL 데이터는 약 50MB입니다. OVAL 데이터만 동기화한 경우 이미 CVE 감사를 수행하여 시스템이 CVE에 취약한지 여부를 확인할 수 있지만, 패치는 채널에서 제공되는 것이므로 적용할 수 없습니다. OVAL 기능의 주요 특징은 다음과 같습니다. 기본적으로 비활성화됨: 이 기능은 기본적으로 꺼져 있으며, 사용자가 rhn.conf 구성 파일을 업데이트하고 관련 서비스를 다시 시작하여 명시적으로 활성화해야 합니다. 되돌릴 수 있음: 문제가 발생하면 사용자는 표준 채널 기반 CVE 감사로 되돌릴 수 있습니다. 성능 고려 사항: 초기 테스트가 수행되었지만, 성능과 관련하여 여전히 우려되는 부분이 있으며, 추가로 최적화가 필요할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 OVAL 데이터는 매일 23:00시에 업데이트됩니다. 데이터를 새로 고쳐 최신 취약성이 있는지 확인한 후 CVE 감사를 시작하는 것이 좋습니다. 절차: OVAL 데이터 지원 활성화 Add or modify the following setting in file /etc/rhn/rhn.conf in the container: java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=true Tomcat 및 Taskomatic 서비스 다시 시작: systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic 문제가 발생하여 기본 동작으로 되돌려야 하는 경우 다음을 설정하여 기능을 비활성화하십시오. 절차: OVAL 데이터 지원 비활성화 rhn.conf 파일에서 다음 설정을 추가하거나 수정: java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=false Tomcat 및 Taskomatic 서비스 다시 시작: systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic 절차: OVAL 데이터 업데이트 Uyuni Web UI에서 관리자 작업 스케줄으로 이동하여 oval-data-sync-default 일정을 선택합니다. oval-data-sync-bunch를 클릭합니다. 단일 실행 일정을 클릭하여 작업을 예약합니다. 작업을 완료한 후 CVE 감사를 계속 진행합니다. 특정 클라이언트에 어떤 취약점이 있는지 정확하게 파악하려면 해당 클라이언트가 사용하는 운영 체제 제품을 식별해야 합니다. 이를 위해 클라이언트의 CPE(Common Platform Enumeration)를 salt 그레인으로 수집한 다음 데이터베이스에 저장합니다. 새로 등록된 클라이언트의 CPE는 자동으로 수집되어 데이터베이스에 저장됩니다. 하지만 기존 클라이언트의 경우 패키지 목록 업데이트 작업을 한 번 이상 실행해야 합니다. 절차: 패키지 목록 업데이트 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 시스템 목록 모두로 이동하여 클라이언트를 선택합니다. 소프트웨어 탭으로 이동하여 패키지 하위 탭으로 이동합니다. 패키지 목록 업데이트를 클릭하여 패키지를 업데이트하고 클라이언트의 CPE를 수집합니다. OVAL 데이터의 무결성과 최신성을 보장하기 위해 Uyuni은(는) 모든 제품의 공식 관리자로부터 OVAL 데이터를 독점적으로 사용합니다. OVAL 데이터 소스의 목록은 아래에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Table 1.

Uyuni 내에서 이러한 정의가 적용되는 대상은 다음과 같습니다. 특정 취약점의 영향을 받는 시스템 취약점으로 표시된 관련 패치의 패키지 버전보다 낮은 버전의 패키지가 설치된 시스템입니다. 특정 취약점의 영향을 받지 않는 시스템 취약점으로 표시된 관련 패치에도 있는 설치된 패키지가 설치되지 않은 시스템입니다. 특정 취약점에 대해 패치된 시스템 취약점으로 표시된 관련 패치와 동일한 패키지 버전 이상의 패키지가 설치된 시스템입니다. 관련 패치 관련 채널에서 Uyuni가 알려진 패치입니다. 관련 채널 Uyuni에서 관리하는 채널로, 시스템에 할당된 채널, 시스템에 할당된 복제된 채널의 원본, 시스템에 설치된 제품에 연결된 채널 또는 시스템에 대한 과거 또는 미래의 서비스 팩 채널입니다. Uyuni 내에서 사용된 정의로 인해 일부 상황에서는 CVE 감사 결과가 정확하지 않을 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 관리되지 않는 채널, 관리되지 않는 패키지 또는 미준수 시스템은 잘못 보고할 수 있습니다.","title":"감사","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auditing","url":"/uyuni/administration/auditing.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

With the built-in backup and restore solution (mgradm backup) you create Uyuni backups. Information about restoring from your backups in the case of a system failure completes this chapter. Because Uyuni relies on a database as well as the installed program and configurations, it is important to back up all components of your installation. Back up your Uyuni installation regularly to prevent data loss and enable quick recovery. 백업 방법과 관계없이 현재 설치 작업 중 사용하는 공간의 세 배 이상을 사용할 수 있어야 합니다. 공간이 부족하면 백업이 실패할 수 있으므로 수시로 확인하십시오. Skip this section if you installed Uyuni 2025.10 from scratch. With the advent of the built-in solution, the old method with the smdba backup tool is deprecated. If you migrated from an old system with smdba to the new solution, you must disable the old funtionality and remove the old backup archives. Either disable smdba before migrating (recommended) or later on the migrated Uyuni 2025.10 system. Procedure: Disabling old method with installed smdba before migration This procedure only works when smdba is still installed. On the command line of the container host, as root, execute: mgrctl exec -- smdba backup-hot --enable=off This will change archive_command in /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf as follows: archive_command = '/bin/true' Now your old system is ready to be migrated to Uyuni 2025.10. Procedure: Disabling old method on Uyuni 2025.10 after migration Use this procedure after migration, when smdba is no longer available. On the container host, as root, edit /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf and set these options: archive_mode = off archive_command = '/bin/true' Restart the container: mgradm restart Uyuni 설치를 가장 포괄적으로 백업하는 방법은 mgradm backup create 명령을 사용하는 것입니다. 이 방법을 사용하면 백업 관리 시간을 절약할 수 있으며 오류가 발생한 경우 더 빠르게 다시 설치 및 재동기화할 수 있습니다. 그러나 이 방법은 상당히 큰 규모의 디스크 공간이 필요하고 백업을 수행하는 데 시간이 오래 걸릴 수 있습니다. mgradm backup create 명령은 디렉토리에 백업을 수행합니다. 이 디렉토리는 로컬 저장소 또는 마운트된 원격 저장소일 수 있습니다. mgradm backup create 명령을 사용하면 백업 내용을 다양하게 사용자 정의할 수 있습니다. 사용 가능한 모든 옵션은 mgradm backup create --help를 참조하십시오. Uyuni의 전체 백업은 다음 구성 요소를 백업하는 것으로 구성됩니다. Uyuni 볼륨 데이터베이스 볼륨 podman 네트워크 구성 podman 비밀 Uyuni systemd 서비스 Uyuni 컨테이너 이미지 The Uyuni service is automatically stopped for the time it takes to create a full backup. The downtime can be significant. After backup is done, service is automatically restarted. Procedure: Creating full backup with mgradm backup create 컨테이너 호스트에서 루트 권한으로 다음을 통해 백업: mgradm backup create $path $path를 백업 위치의 경로로 바꿉니다. mgradm backup create 도구를 사용하면 부분 백업을 생성할 수 있습니다. 개별 볼륨 또는 전체 볼륨을 건너뛰고, 데이터베이스 백업 및 이미지를 건너뛸 수 있습니다. 특히 데이터베이스 백업을 건너뛰는 경우 백업은 Uyuni 서비스를 중단하지 않고 생성되며, 2단계 백업 절차 중 1단계로 작동할 수 있습니다. Partial backups are only considering a part of the data, and do not take potential dependencies with other parts which may not have been backed up in consideration. Therefore they cannot guarantee backup/restore consistency. Procedure: Creating partial backup by skipping database backup 컨테이너 호스트에서 루트 권한으로 다음을 통해 백업: mgradm backup create --skipdatabase $path $path를 백업 위치의 경로로 바꿉니다. Procedure: Creating partial backup by skipping a volume 컨테이너 호스트에서 루트 권한으로 다음을 통해 백업: mgradm backup create --skipvolumes $volumes $path $path를 백업 위치의 경로로 바꿉니다. Replace $volumes by the name of the volume name to be excluded from the backup, or by a comma separated list of volumes to be excluded. 데이터베이스 볼륨을 제외한 모든 볼륨을 건너뛰려면 all을 사용합니다. mgradm backup 명령은 Uyuni 볼륨의 내부 목록을 사용합니다. 설치 중에 추가 볼륨을 구성했거나 백업에 추가 볼륨을 추가해야 하는 경우, --extravolumes $volumes를 사용하여 볼륨을 지정해야 합니다. Procedure: Creating backup with additional custom volume 컨테이너 호스트에서 루트 권한으로 다음을 통해 백업: mgradm backup create --extravolumes $volume $path $path를 백업 위치의 경로로 바꿉니다. $volumes를 백업에 포함시킬 볼륨 이름의 이름으로 바꾸거나 포함시킬 쉼표로 구분된 볼륨 목록으로 바꿉니다. Procedure: Performing a manual database backup 백업에 사용할 영구 저장소 공간을 할당합니다. Uyuni 컨테이너 호스트의 명령 프롬프트에서 루트 권한으로 다음을 사용: mgradm backup create --skipvolumes all --skipconfig --skipimages $path 기존 백업에서 Uyuni을(를) 복원하면 복원할 볼륨, 이미지, 구성에 대한 백업이 열거됩니다. 백업 생성의 경우와 달리 복원 작업에서는 내부 볼륨 목록을 사용하지 않고, 백업에 있는 모든 볼륨 또는 이미지를 자동으로 감지합니다. 복원할 항목 목록이 수집된 후에는 존재 여부 및 무결성 검사가 수행됩니다. 존재 여부 검사는 백업 복원이 실수로 기존 볼륨, 이미지 또는 구성을 덮어쓰지 않도록 보장합니다. 무결성 검사는 백업 항목 체크섬을 계산하여 수행됩니다. 두 검사가 모두 성공하면 실제 백업 복원이 수행됩니다. Uyuni 서비스는 백업 복원이 완료된 후에 자동으로 시작되지 않습니다. Procedure: Restoring from an existing backup 컨테이너 호스트에서 루트 권한으로 다음을 사용하여 Uyuni 서버 다시 배포: mgradm stop mgradm backup restore $path mgradm start $path를 백업 위치의 경로로 바꿉니다. 백업 확인은 시간이 오래 소요되는 작업일 수 있습니다. 다른 방법으로 백업 무결성이 보장되는 경우에는 --skipverify 옵션을 사용하여 확인을 건너뛸 수 있습니다. 어떤 이유로 백업에서 볼륨 복원을 건너뛰어야 하는 경우, --skipvolumes $volumes 옵션을 사용하면 됩니다. Procedure: Recommended steps after Uyuni restore Uyuni Web UI를 사용하거나 컨테이너의 명령 프롬프트에서 mgr-sync 도구를 사용하여 Uyuni 리포지토리를 다시 동기화하십시오. 제품을 다시 등록하거나 등록 및 SSL 인증서 생성 섹션을 건너뛸 수 있습니다.

Uyuni에서 결과 리포지토리는 일반 리포지토리와 동일한 방식으로 사용할 수 있습니다. AppStream 리포지토리는 Web UI 전체에서 기본적으로 지원됩니다. 그러므로 이 프로세스는 AppStream 리포지토리 작업에서 반드시 필요한 프로세스가 아닙니다. AppStream 필터는 대상 리포지토리에 포함할 단일 모듈 스트림을 선택합니다. 여러 필터를 추가하여 여러 모듈 스트림을 선택할 수 있습니다. CLM 프로젝트에서 AppStream 필터를 사용하지 않으면 모듈형 소스의 모듈 메타데이터는 그대로 유지되고 대상 리포지토리에는 동일한 모듈 메타데이터가 포함됩니다. CLM 프로젝트에서 AppStream 필터가 한 개 이상 활성화되어 있으면 모든 대상 리포지토리가 일반 리포지토리로 변환됩니다. 일부 경우 모듈의 패키지를 포함하지 않고 일반 리포지토리를 구축하는 것이 가능합니다. 이를 위해서는 선택기 none (disable moduleity)를 사용하여 AppStream 필터를 추가하십시오. 그러면 대상 리포지토리의 모든 모듈이 비활성화됩니다. 이것은 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 클라이언트에 특히 유용합니다. 대부분의 모듈의 기본 버전은 AppStream 리포지토리에 일반 패키지로 이미 포함되어 있습니다. AppStream 필터를 사용하려면 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStreams와 같은 모듈형 리포지토리가 있는 CLM 프로젝트가 필요합니다. 시작하기 전에 필요한 모듈을 소스로 포함했는지 확인합니다. 절차: AppStream 필터 사용 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 또는 9 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 같음을 선택합니다. 모듈 이름 필드에 모듈 이름을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, postgresql입니다. 스트림 필드에 원하는 스트림의 이름을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 10입니다. 이 필드를 비워 두면 모듈의 기본 스트림이 선택됩니다. 새 필터를 생성하려면 저장을 클릭합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭하고 새 AppStream 필터를 선택한 후 저장을 클릭합니다. 필터 생성/편집 양식의 찾아보기 기능을 사용하여 모듈형 채널을 위해 사용할 수 있는 모듈 스트림 목록에서 모듈을 선택할 수 있습니다. 절차: 사용 가능한 모듈 스트림 찾아보기 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 또는 9 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 같음을 선택합니다. 모든 모듈형 채널을 보려면 사용 가능한 모듈 찾아보기를 클릭합니다. 모듈 및 스트림을 탐색할 채널을 선택합니다. 모듈 이름 필드에서 검색할 모듈 이름을 입력하거나 목록에서 선택합니다. 스트림 필드에서 검색할 스트림 이름을 입력하거나 목록에서 선택합니다. 채널 선택은 모듈 탐색을 위해서만 사용할 수 있습니다. 선택한 채널은 필터와 함께 저장되지 않으며 어떠한 방식으로도 CLM 프로세스에 영향을 미치지 않습니다. 대상 리포지토리에 포함할 다른 모듈 스트림에 대한 추가 AppStream 필터를 생성할 수 있습니다. 선택한 스트림이 활용하는 모든 모듈 스트림이 자동으로 포함됩니다. 충돌하거나 호환되지 않거나 누락된 모듈 스트림을 지정하지 않도록 주의하십시오. 예를 들어, 동일한 모듈에서 스트림을 두 개 선택하는 것은 적절하지 않습니다. 절차: 모듈성 활성화 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 또는 9 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 없음(모듈성 비활성화)을 선택합니다. 새 필터를 생성하려면 저장을 클릭합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭하고 새 AppStream 필터를 선택한 후 저장을 클릭합니다. 이 작업을 수행하면 대상 리포지토리에서 모듈 메타데이터가 효과적으로 제거됩니다. 단, 모듈에 속한 패키지는 제외입니다.

Uyuni를 사용하면 다양한 유형의 필터를 생성하여 프로젝트 빌드에 사용되는 컨텐트를 제어할 수 있습니다. 필터를 사용하면 빌드에 포함되거나 제외되는 패키지를 선택할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 모든 커널 패키지를 제외하거나 일부 패키지의 특정 릴리스만 포함할 수 있습니다. 지원되는 필터: 패키지 필터링 이름 기준 이름, 에포크, 버전, 릴리스 및 아키텍처 기준 제공 이름 기준 패치 필터링 권고 이름 기준 권고 유형 기준 시놉시스 기준 키워드 기준 날짜 기준 영향을 받는 패키지 기준 모듈 스트림 기준 컨텐트 필터링 중에는 패키지 종속성이 해결되지 않습니다. 필터와 함께 사용할 수 있는 여러 선택기가 있습니다. 사용 가능한 필터 유형은 선택한 필터 유형에 따라 다릅니다. 사용할 수 있는 선택기: 포함 일치(정규식 형식이어야 함) 같음 큼 크거나 같음 작거나 같음 작음 이상 각 필터에는 허용 또는 거부로 설정할 수 있는 규칙 파라미터가 있습니다. 필터는 다음과 같이 처리됩니다. 패키지 또는 패치가 거부 필터를 충족하면 결과에서 제외됩니다. 패키지 또는 패치가 허용 필터를 만족하는 경우, 해당 항목은 결과에 포함됩니다(거부 필터에 의해 제외된 경우에도 동일). 패키지에 대한 허용 필터는 패키지 필터에서만 작동하고, 패치에 대한 허용 필터는 패치 필터에서만 작동합니다. 즉, 패키지 필터를 사용하면 패치 필터를 통해 필터링된 패키지를 다시 추가할 수 없고, 반대로 패치 필터를 통해 필터링된 패치를 패키지 필터를 통해 다시 추가할 수 없습니다. 이 동작은 일반 거부 필터를 사용하여 많은 수의 패키지 또는 패치를 제외하고 특정 허용 필터가 적용된 특정 패키지 또는 패치를 \"선별\"하려는 경우에 유용합니다. 컨텐트 필터는 조직 전체에 적용되며 프로젝트 간에 공유할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트에 이미 빌드된 소스가 포함되어 있는 경우 환경을 추가하면 기존 내용이 자동으로 채워집니다. 내용은 주기의 이전 환경이 있는 경우 해당 환경에서 가져옵니다. 이전 환경이 없으면 프로젝트 소스가 다시 빌드될 때까지 비어 있습니다. 몇 가지 일반적인 시나리오에 대한 필터를 편리하게 생성할 수 있도록 Uyuni는 필터 템플릿을 제공합니다. 이러한 템플릿을 적용하면 특정 사용 사례에 맞게 사전에 필터 집합을 만드는 데 유용합니다. 이 섹션에서는 사용할 수 있는 템플릿과 그 사용법에 대해 설명합니다. 라이브 패치가 포함된 프로젝트에서는 정기적인 향후 커널 패키지를 제외해야 라이브 패치 패키지만 클라이언트에 대한 업데이트로 제공됩니다. 반면에 이미 설치된 일반 커널 패키지는 시스템 무결성을 유지하기 위해 여전히 포함되어야 합니다. 이 템플릿을 적용하면 이 동작을 수행하기 위해 필요한 필터 세 개가 생성됩니다. 기본 커널 버전과 동일한 kernel-default 패키지를 포함하는 패치 허용 reboot_suggested 키워드가 포함된 패치 거부 installhint(reboot-needed)라는 이름을 제공하는 패키지가 포함된 패치 거부 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터로 이동하고 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 개별 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 SUSE 제품 기반 라이브 패치를 선택합니다. 제품 필드에서 라이브 패치를 설정할 제품을 선택합니다. 커널 필드의 선택한 제품에서 사용할 수 있는 버전 목록에서 커널 버전을 선택합니다. 이후의 일반 커널 패치를 거부하는 필터는 이 버전을 기반으로 합니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭합니다. 지정된 접두사가 있는 필터 세 개를 선택하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 등록된 특정 시스템에 설치된 커널 버전을 기반으로 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하려면 \"시스템 기반 라이브 패치\" 템플릿을 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 템플릿을 적용하면 이 동작을 수행하기 위해 필요한 필터 세 개가 생성됩니다. 기본 커널 버전과 동일한 kernel-default 패키지를 포함하는 패치 허용 reboot_suggested 키워드가 포함된 패치 거부 installhint(reboot-needed)라는 이름을 제공하는 패키지가 포함된 패치 거부 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터로 이동하고 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 특정 시스템에 기반 라이브 패치를 선택합니다. 시스템 필드에서, 목록에서 시스템을 선택하거나 시스템 이름을 입력하여 옵션 범위를 좁힙니다. 커널 필드에서 선택한 시스템에 설치된 버전 목록에서 커널 버전을 선택합니다. 이후의 일반 커널 패치를 거부하는 필터는 이 버전을 기반으로 합니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭합니다. 지정된 접두사가 있는 필터 세 개를 선택하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 프로젝트에 포함된 모듈형 리포지토리에서 모든 모듈을 사용할 수 있도록 하려면 이 필터 템플릿을 사용하여 자동으로 추가할 수 있습니다. 적용되면 이 템플릿은 모듈 및 기본 스트림별로 AppStream 필터를 생성합니다. 이 프로세스가 프로젝트 페이지에서 수행되면 필터가 프로젝트에 자동으로 추가됩니다. 그렇지 않으면 생성된 필터를 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터에 나열하고 필요에 따라 모든 프로젝트에 추가할 수도 있습니다. 각 개별 필터를 편집하여 다른 모듈 스트림을 선택하거나 완전히 제거하여 대상 리포지토리에서 해당 모듈을 제외할 수 있습니다. 모든 모듈 스트림이 서로 호환되는 것은 아니므로, 개별 스트림을 변경하면 모듈 종속성을 성공적으로 해결하지 못할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 프로젝트 세부 사항 페이지의 필터 창에 문제를 설명하는 오류가 표시되고 모든 모듈 선택이 호환될 때까지 빌드 버튼이 비활성화됩니다. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 이상 모듈에는 정의된 기본 스트림이 없습니다. 그러므로 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9개의 소스와 함께 이 템플릿을 사용해도 효과가 없습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리를 사용하여 AppStream 리포지토리를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 섹션에서 필터 연결/해제를 클릭한 후 새 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 기본값 포함 AppStream 모듈을 선택합니다. 채널 필드에서 모듈을 가져올 모듈형 채널을 선택합니다. 이 드롭다운에는 모듈형 채널만 표시됩니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 필터 섹션으로 스크롤하여 새로 연결된 AppStream 필터를 확인합니다. 개별 필터를 편집/제거하여 필요한 대로 프로젝트를 조정할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트를 생성하고 환경을 정의하며 소스와 필터를 첨부하면 처음으로 프로젝트를 빌드할 수 있습니다. 빌드는 연결된 소스에 필터를 적용하고 이를 프로젝트의 첫 번째 환경에 복제합니다. 동일한 벤더 채널을 여러 컨텐트 프로젝트의 소스로 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 Uyuni는 복제된 각 채널에 대해 새 패치 복제를 생성하지 않습니다. 대신 단일 패치 클론이 복제된 모든 채널 간에 공유됩니다. 벤더가 패치를 수정하면 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 패치가 철회되거나 패치 내의 패키지가 변경된 경우가 이에 해당합니다. 컨텐트 프로젝트 중 하나를 빌드하면 채널이 컨텐트 프로젝트의 다른 환경이나 조직의 다른 컨텐트 프로젝트 채널에 있더라도 복제된 패치를 공유하는 모든 채널이 기본적으로 원본과 동기화됩니다. 조직 설정에서 자동 패치 동기화를 해제하여 이 동작을 변경할 수 있습니다. 나중에 패치를 공유하는 모든 채널에 대해 수동으로 패치를 동기화하려면 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하고 동기화하려는 채널을 클릭한 후 동기화 하위 탭으로 이동합니다. 수동 패치 동기화도 패치를 공유하는 모든 조직 채널에 영향을 미칩니다. 절차: 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트 빌드 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하고 빌드할 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 사용 가능한 환경이 있는지 확인한 후 프로젝트를 빌드하십시오. 첨부된 소스 및 필터를 검토하고 빌드를 클릭합니다. 이 빌드의 변경 또는 업데이트 사항을 설명하는 버전 메시지를 제공합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 빌드 진행 상황을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 빌드가 완료되면 환경 버전이 하나씩 증가하고 소프트웨어 채널과 같이 빌드된 소스를 클라이언트에 할당할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트가 빌드되면 빌드된 소스를 순차적으로 환경으로 승격할 수 있습니다. 절차: 환경 승격 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하고 작업할 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 후속 환경으로 승격할 환경을 찾고 승격을 클릭합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 빌드 진행 상황을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트를 빌드 및 승격할 때 Uyuni는 소프트웨어 채널 트리를 생성합니다. 환경에 클라이언트를 추가하려면 클라이언트의 시스템 세부 정보 페이지의 소프트웨어 소프트웨어 채널을 사용하여 기본 및 하위 소프트웨어 채널을 클라이언트에 할당합니다. 새로 추가된 복제된 채널은 클라이언트에 자동으로 할당되지 않습니다. 소스를 추가 또는 승격하는 경우 채널 할당을 수동으로 확인하고 업데이트해야 합니다. 자동 할당은 향후 버전에서 Uyuni에 추가될 예정입니다.","title":"컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트 생성","hash":"_컨텐트_라이프싸이클_프로젝트_생성","id":1},{"text":"2. 필터 유형","hash":"_필터_유형","id":2},{"text":"2.1. 필터 규칙 파라미터","hash":"_필터_규칙_파라미터","id":3},{"text":"3. 필터 템플릿","hash":"filter-templates","id":4},{"text":"3.1.

Either select Images Build, or click the build icon in the Images Profiles list. 절차: 이미지 빌드 이미지 빌드를 선택합니다. 기본 최신이 아닌 다른 버전을 원하는 경우 다른 태그 이름을 추가합니다(컨테이너에만 적용됨). 이미지 프로파일 및 빌드 호스트를 선택합니다. 빌드 필드 오른쪽에 프로파일 요약이 표시됩니다. 빌드 프로파일을 선택하면 선택한 프로파일에 대한 자세한 정보가 여기에 표시됩니다. 빌드를 예약하려면 빌드 버튼을 클릭합니다. 이미지 빌드 프로세스 중에 빌드 서버는 어떤 형태의 자동 마운터도 실행할 수 없습니다. 해당하는 경우, 루트 권한으로 실행 중인 Gnome 세션이 없는지 확인하십시오. 자동 마운터가 실행 중인 경우 이미지 빌드가 완료되지만, 이미지의 체크섬이 달라 실패하게 됩니다. 이미지 빌드가 성공하면 검사 단계가 시작됩니다. 검사 단계에서 SUSE Multi-Linux Manager는 이미지에 대한 정보를 수집합니다. 이미지에 설치된 패키지 목록 이미지의 체크섬 이미지 유형 및 기타 이미지 세부 사항 빌드된 이미지 유형이 PXE인 경우 Salt 열도 생성됩니다. 이미지 열은 데이터베이스에 저장되며 Salt 하위 시스템은 생성된 이미지에 대한 세부 사항에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 세부 사항에는 이미지 파일의 위치 및 제공 위치, 이미지 체크섬, 네트워크 부팅에 필요한 정보 등이 포함됩니다. 생성된 열은 연결된 모든 클라이언트에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 이미지를 빌드하려면 여러 종속 단계가 필요합니다. 빌드가 실패하는 경우 Salt 상태 결과 및 빌드 로그를 조사하면 실패의 원인을 식별하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 빌드 실패 시 수행할 수 있는 검사: 빌드 호스트는 빌드 소스에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 빌드 호스트 및 Uyuni 서버 모두에 이미지를 위한 충분한 디스크 공간이 있습니다. 활성화 키에 연결된 올바른 채널이 있습니다. 사용된 빌드 소스가 유효합니다. Uyuni 공용 인증서가 포함된 RPM 패키지는 최신 버전이며 /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 공용 인증서 RPM을 새로 고치는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 빌드 호스트 생성에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에는 이미지 관련 작업을 할 때 알려진 몇 가지 문제가 포함되어 있습니다. HTTP 소스 또는 git 리포지토리에 액세스하기 위해 사용되는 HTTPS 인증서는 사용자 정의 상태 파일을 통해 클라이언트에 배포하거나 수동으로 구성해야 합니다. Kiwi 기반 이미지 임포트는 지원되지 않습니다. 사용할 수 있는 빌드 이미지를 나열하려면 이미지 이미지 목록를 선택하십시오. 모든 이미지 목록이 표시됩니다. 이미지에 대해 표시되는 데이터에는 이미지 이름, 버전, 리비전 및 빌드 상태가 포함됩니다. 이미지에 사용할 수 있는 가능한 패치 및 패키지 업데이트 목록을 통해 이미지 업데이트 상태를 확인할 수도 있습니다. OS 이미지의 경우 이름 및 버전 필드는 Kiwi 소스에서 제공되며 빌드가 성공적으로 완료되면 업데이트됩니다. 빌드 중 또는 빌드 실패 후, 이 필드에는 프로파일 이름을 기반으로 하는 임시 이름이 표시됩니다. 리비전은 빌드가 성공할 때마다 자동으로 증가합니다. OS 이미지의 경우 저장소에 여러 리비전이 함께 있을 수 있습니다. 컨테이너 이미지의 경우 저장소에는 최신 리비전만 보존됩니다. 이전 버전(패키지, 패치 등)에 대한 정보는 보존되며 구식 표시 확인란을 사용하여 나열할 수 있습니다. 이미지에서 자세히 버튼을 클릭하면 자세한 내용을 확인할 수 있습니다. 상세 보기에는 관련 패치의 정확한 목록, 이미지 내에 설치된 모든 패키지 목록 및 빌드 로그가 포함됩니다. 삭제 버튼을 클릭하면 목록에서 이미지가 삭제됩니다. 또한, 관련 열, OS 이미지 저장소의 파일 및 사용되지 않는 리비전도 삭제됩니다. 빌드가 성공한 후 상태를 검사한 경우에만 패치 및 패키지 목록을 사용할 수 있습니다.","title":"이미지 빌드 및 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"image-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/image-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 이미지 빌드 개요","hash":"at.images.overview","id":1},{"text":"2. 컨테이너 이미지","hash":"at.images.docker","id":2},{"text":"2.1. 요구사항","hash":"at.images.docker.requirements","id":3},{"text":"2.2. 빌드 호스트 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.buildhost","id":4},{"text":"2.3. 컨테이너에 대한 활성화 키 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.buildchannels","id":5},{"text":"2.4. 이미지 저장소 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.imagestore","id":6},{"text":"2.5. 이미지 프로파일 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.profile","id":7},{"text":"2.5.1. 예시 Dockerfile 소스","hash":"at.images.docker.sourceexample","id":8},{"text":"2.5.2. 사용자 정의 정보 키-값 쌍을 Docker Buildargs로 사용","hash":"_사용자_정의_정보_키_값_쌍을_docker_buildargs로_사용","id":9},{"text":"2.6. 이미지 빌드","hash":"at.images.docker.building","id":10},{"text":"2.7. 이미지 임포트","hash":"at.images.docker.importing","id":11},{"text":"2.8. 문제 해결","hash":"at.images.docker.troubleshooting","id":12},{"text":"2.8.1. 이미지 검사","hash":"_이미지_검사","id":13},{"text":"2.8.2.

When the server is updated consider updating some tools on the clients, too. Updating venv-salt-minion, zypper, and other related management package on clients is not a strict requirement, but it is a best practice in general. For example, a maintenance update on the server might introduce a major new Salt version. Then Salt clients continue to work but might experience problems later on. To avoid this SUSE makes sure that venv-salt-minion will always be updated safely. 서버 간 동기화 슬레이브 서버를 사용 중인 경우 Uyuni 서버 업데이트 완료 후 업데이트합니다.

You need to install Prometheus and Grafana on a machine separate from the Uyuni Server. We recommend to use a managed Salt SUSE client as your monitoring server. Prometheus는 풀 방식을 사용하여 메트릭을 가져오므로 서버는 모니터링되는 클라이언트에 대한 TCP 연결을 설정할 수 있어야 합니다. 클라이언트에는 해당하는 열린 포트가 있어야 하며 네트워크를 통해 연결할 수 있어야 합니다. 또는, 역방향 프록시를 사용하여 연결을 설정할 수 있습니다. Prometheus는 시계열 데이터베이스에 실시간 메트릭을 기록하기 위해 사용되는 오픈 소스 모니터링 도구입니다. 메트릭은 HTTP를 통해 끌어오며, 고성능과 확장성을 가능하게 합니다. Prometheus 메트릭은 시계열 데이터 또는 동일한 그룹 또는 차원에 속하는 타임스탬프 값입니다. 메트릭은 이름과 레이블 집합으로 고유하게 식별됩니다. 메트릭 이름 레이블 타임스탬프 값 ┌────────┴───────┐ ┌───────────┴───────────┐ ┌──────┴──────┐ ┌─┴─┐ http_requests_total{status=\"200\", method=\"GET\"} @1557331801.111 42236 모니터링되는 각 애플리케이션 또는 시스템은 코드 계측 또는 Prometheus 엑스포트를 통해 위의 형식으로 메트릭을 노출해야 합니다. 엑스포트는 타사 시스템의 메트릭을 Prometheus 메트릭으로 엑스포트할 때 유용하게 사용할 수 있는 라이브러리입니다. 엑스포트는 Prometheus 메트릭을 사용하여 특정 애플리케이션 또는 시스템을 직접 계측하는 것이 불가능할 때마다 유용합니다. 모니터링되는 호스트에서 여러 엑스포트를 실행하여 로컬 메트릭을 엑스포트할 수 있습니다. Prometheus 커뮤니티는 공식 엑스포트 목록을 제공하며, 커뮤니티 기여를 통해 더욱 추가될 것입니다. 자세한 내용과 광범위한 엑스포트 목록은 https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Grafana는 데이터 시각화, 모니터링 및 분석을 위한 도구입니다. 그리고 일정 기간 동안 특정 메트릭을 나타내는 패널이 포함된 대시보드를 생성하기 위한 용도로 사용됩니다. 일반적으로 Grafana는 Prometheus와 함께 사용되지만, ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL 및 Influx DB와 같은 다른 데이터 소스도 지원합니다. Grafana에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://grafana.com/docs/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 모니터링 서버를 설정하려면 Prometheus와 Grafana를 설치 및 구성해야 합니다. Only SUSE clients are supported as a monitoring server.

The packages are available from the Uyuni client tools channels, and can be enabled and configured directly in the Uyuni Web UI. 다음 엑스포트는 관리되는 시스템에 설치할 수 있습니다. 노드 엑스포트: golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter. https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter를 참조하십시오. PostgreSQL 엑스포트: prometheus-postgres_exporter. https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter를 참조하십시오. Apache 엑스포트: golang-github-lusitaniae-apache_exporter. https://github.com/Lusitaniae/apache_exporter를 참조하십시오. On SL Micro, only the Node exporter and the Blackbox exporter are available. 엑스포트를 설치 및 구성한 후에는 Prometheus를 사용하여 모니터링되는 시스템에서 메트릭 수집을 시작할 수 있습니다. 모니터링 서버를 Web UI로 구성한 경우 메트릭 수집이 자동으로 수행됩니다. Procedure: Configuring Prometheus exporters on a client Uyuni Web UI에서 모니터링할 클라이언트의 세부 사항 페이지를 열고 수식 탭으로 이동합니다. Prometheus 엑스포트 수식에서 활성화됨 확인란을 선택합니다. 저장을 클릭합니다. 수식 Prometheus 엑스포트 탭으로 이동합니다. 활성화할 엑스포트를 선택하고 필요에 따라 인수를 사용자 정의합니다. 주소 필드에는 콜론이 앞에 오는 포트 번호(:9100) 또는 완전히 확인할 수 있는 주소(example:9100)를 사용할 수 있습니다. 수식 저장을 클릭합니다. highstate를 적용합니다. The following ports need to be enabled and not blocked by the firewall: on the monitor: 9090/tcp on the monitored system: 9100/tcp, 9117/tcp, and 9187/tcp 해당 그룹 내의 개별 시스템에 사용된 동일한 구성을 적용하여 시스템 그룹에 대한 모니터링 수식을 구성할 수도 있습니다. 수식 모니터링에 대한 자세한 내용은 Monitoring Formula에서 참조하십시오. Grafana 비밀번호를 변경하려면 Grafana 설명서에 설명된 단계를 따릅니다. https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/user-management/user-preferences/#change-your-grafana-password Grafana 관리자 비밀번호를 분실한 경우 다음 명령을 사용하여 root로 재설정할 수 있습니다. grafana-cli --configOverrides cfg:default.paths.data=/var/lib/grafana --homepath /usr/share/grafana admin reset-admin-password <new_password> Prometheus는 풀 방식을 사용하여 메트릭을 가져오므로 서버는 모니터링되는 클라이언트에 TCP 연결을 설정할 수 있어야 합니다. 기본적으로 Prometheus에서 사용되는 포트입니다. 노드 엑스포트: 9100 PostgreSQL 엑스포트: 9187 Apache 엑스포트: 9117 추가적으로, Prometheus를 실행하는 호스트가 아닌 호스트에서 경고 관리자를 실행하는 경우에는 포트 9093도 열어야 합니다. 경고 관리자는 Prometheus 솔루션의 일부입니다. 경고 관리자는 Prometheus 서버 인스턴스와 같은 클라이언트 애플리케이션에서 보내는 경고를 처리합니다. 경고 관리자에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 클라우드 인스턴스에 설치된 클라이언트의 경우 모니터링 서버에 대한 액세스 권한이 있는 보안 그룹에 필요한 포트를 추가할 수 있습니다. 또는 엑스포트의 로컬 네트워크에 Prometheus 인스턴스를 배포하고 페더레이션을 구성할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 기본 모니터링 서버가 로컬 Prometheus 인스턴스에서 시계열을 스크랩할 수 있습니다. 이 방법을 사용하는 경우 Prometheus API 포트인 9090 포트만 열면 됩니다. Prometheus 페더레이션에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 네트워크 경계를 통해 요청을 프록시할 수도 있습니다. PushProx와 같은 도구는 네트워크 장벽의 양쪽에 프록시와 클라이언트를 배포하고 Prometheus가 NAT와 같은 네트워크 토폴로지에서 작동할 수 있도록 합니다. PushProx에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://github.com/RobustPerception/PushProx에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Prometheus는 풀 방식을 사용하여 메트릭을 가져오므로, 서버는 모니터링되는 클라이언트의 각 엑스포트에 대한 TCP 연결을 설정할 수 있어야 합니다. 방화벽 구성을 단순화하기 위해 엑스포트에 역방향 프록시를 사용하여 단일 포트의 모든 메트릭을 노출할 수 있습니다. Procedure: Installing Prometheus exporters with reverse proxy Uyuni Web UI에서 모니터링할 시스템의 세부 사항 페이지를 열고 수식 탭으로 이동합니다. Prometheus 엑스포트 확인란을 선택하여 엑스포트 수식을 활성화하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 상단 메뉴에서 Prometheus 엑스포트 탭으로 이동합니다. Check the Enable reverse proxy option, and enter a valid reverse proxy port number. For example, 9999. Ensure that port 9999/tcp is open on the firewall. 필요에 따라, 다른 엑스포트를 사용자 정의합니다. 수식 저장을 클릭합니다. highstate를 적용하고 성공적으로 완료되었는지 확인합니다. 수식 모니터링에 대한 자세한 내용은 Monitoring Formula에서 참조하십시오. Prometheus 서버 및 Prometheus 노드 엑스포트는 TLS 암호화 및 인증으로 엔드포인트를 보호하는 기본 제공 방법을 제공합니다. Uyuni Web UI는 관련된 모든 구성요소의 구성을 간소화합니다. TLS 인증서는 사용자가 제공하고 배포해야 합니다. Uyuni에서 지원하는 보안 모델은 다음과 같습니다. 노드 엑스포트: TLS 암호화 및 클라이언트 인증서 기반 인증 Prometheus: TLS 암호화 및 기본 인증 사용 가능한 모든 옵션 구성에 대한 자세한 내용은 Monitoring Formula에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 Uyuni는 모니터링 구성을 보호하기 위한 인증서를 제공하지 않습니다. 보안을 제공하기 위해 자체 서명되거나 타사 인증 기관(CA)에서 서명한 사용자 지정 인증서를 생성하거나 임포트할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에서는 Uyuni CA를 사용하여 자체 서명된 Prometheus 및 노드 엑스포트 미니언에 대한 클라이언트/서버 인증서를 생성하는 방법을 설명합니다. 절차: 서버/클라이언트 TLS 인증서 생성 At the command prompt of the Uyuni container host, as root, run the following commands: To generate certificate files, run the following command. Ensure that the set-cname parameter is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Salt client.

SCAP(Security Content Automation Protocol)는 커뮤니티 아이디어에서 파생된 상호 운용이 가능한 사양의 종합으로, 엔터프라이즈 시스템의 시스템 보안을 유지하기 위해 NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)에서 유지보수하는 사양군입니다. SCAP는 시스템 보안을 유지하기 위한 표준화된 접근 방식을 제공하기 위해 만들어졌으며, 사용되는 표준은 커뮤니티 및 엔터프라이즈 비즈니스의 니즈를 충족하기 위해 지속적으로 변경됩니다. 일관적이고 반복 가능한 개정 작업 흐름을 제공하기 위해 신규 사양은 NIST의 SCAP 릴리스 주기에 의해 관리됩니다. 자세한 내용은 다음에서 확인할 수 있습니다. https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol https://www.open-scap.org/features/standards/ https://ncp.nist.gov/repository?scap Uyuni는 OpenSCAP를 사용하여 SCAP 사양을 구현합니다. OpenSCAP는 XCCDF(Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format)를 활용하는 감사 도구입니다. XCCDF는 검사 목록의 내용을 나타내는 표준 방식이며 보안 검사 목록을 정의합니다. 또한, CPE(Common Platform Enumeration), CCE(Common Configuration Enumeration), OVAL(Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language)과 같은 다른 사양과 결합하여 SCAP 인증 제품에서 처리할 수 있는 SCAP로 표시되는 검사 목록을 생성합니다. OpenSCAP는 SUSE 보안 팀에서 생성한 컨텐트를 사용하여 패치가 있는지 확인합니다. OpenSCAP은 시스템 보안 구성 설정을 확인하고 표준 및 사양에 기반한 규칙을 활용하여 시스템의 손상 징후를 검사합니다. SUSE 보안 팀에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://www.suse.com/support/security를 참조하십시오. 시작하기 전, SCAP 스캔을 위해 클라이언트 시스템을 준비해야 합니다. SSH 연락 방법을 사용하는 Salt 클라이언트에서는 OpenSCAP 감사를 사용할 수 없습니다. 스캔 클라이언트는 스캔이 수행 중인 클라이언트에서 대규모의 메모리와 컴퓨팅 파워를 소모할 수 있습니다. Red Hat 클라이언트의 경우 스캔할 각 클라이언트에서 최소 2 GB의 RAM을 사용할 수 있어야 합니다. 시작하기 전에 클라이언트에 OpenSCAP 스캐너와 SCAP Security Guide(컨텐트) 패키지를 설치합니다. 운영 체제에 따라 이러한 패키지는 기본 운영 체제 또는 Uyuni 클라이언트 도구에 포함되어 있습니다. 아래 테이블에는 필요한 패키지가 나열되어 있습니다. Table 1. OpenSCAP 패키지 운영 체제 스캐너 컨텐트 SLES openscap-utils scap-security-guide openSUSE openscap-utils scap-security-guide RHEL openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat CentOS openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Oracle Linux openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Ubuntu libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-ubuntu Debian libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-debian RHEL 7 및 호환 시스템은 오래된 컨텐트가 포함된 scap-security-guide 패키지를 제공합니다. Uyuni 클라이언트 도구에 포함된 scap-security-guide-redhat 패키지를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. SUSE는 다양한 openscap 프로파일에 대한 scap-security-guide 패키지를 제공합니다. scap-security-guide의 현재 버전에서 SUSE가 지원하는 프로파일: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 DISA STIG 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 ANSSI-BP-028 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 PCI-DSS 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15용 HIPAA 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 CIS 프로파일 SAP Applications 15용 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server의 공용 클라우드 이미지 강화 SUSE Linux Enterprise 15용 공용 클라우드 강화 SLE 12 및 15용 표준 시스템 보안 프로파일 이 목록의 다른 프로파일은 커뮤니티에서 제공한 것이며 SUSE에서 공식적으로 지원하지 않습니다. 비SUSE 운영 체제의 경우 포함된 프로파일은 커뮤니티에서 제공하는 프로파일입니다. SUSE에서는 공식적으로 지원하지 않습니다. OpenSCAP는 SCAP 컨텐트 파일을 사용하여 테스트 규칙을 정의합니다. 이러한 컨텐트 파일은 XCCDF 또는 OVAL 표준을 기반으로 생성됩니다. SCAP 보안 가이드뿐만 아니라 공개적으로 사용할 수 있는 컨텐트 파일을 다운로드하고 요구사항에 따라 사용자 정의할 수 있습니다. 그리고 기본 컨텐트 파일 템플릿용 SCAP 보안 가이드 패키지를 설치할 수 있습니다. 또는 XCCDF 또는 OVAL에 익숙한 경우 자체 컨텐트 파일을 생성할 수 있습니다. 템플릿을 사용하여 SCAP 컨텐트 파일을 생성하는 것이 권장됩니다. 자체 사용자 정의 컨텐트 파일을 생성 및 사용하는 경우 자신이 모든 위험을 감수해야 합니다. 사용자 정의 컨텐트 파일을 사용하여 시스템이 손상된 경우 SUSE에서 지원하지 않을 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 파일을 생성한 후에는 해당 파일을 클라이언트로 전송해야 합니다. 물리적 저장 매체를 사용하거나 Salt(예: salt-cp 또는 Salt File Server), ftp 또는 scp를 사용하여 네트워크를 통해 다른 파일을 이동할 때와 동일한 방식으로 이 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. Uyuni로 관리하는 클라이언트에 컨텐트 파일을 배포하는 패키지를 생성하는 것이 권장됩니다. 무결성을 보장하기 위해 패키지가 서명 및 검증될 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 사용자 정의 채널에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 운영 체제에 따라 다양한 OpenSCAP 컨텐트 파일 및 프로파일을 사용할 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 파일 한 개에는 프로파일이 두 개 이상 포함될 수 있습니다. RPM 기반 운영 체제에서 다음 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 SCAP 파일의 위치를 확인합니다. rpm -ql <scap-security-guide-package-name-from-table> DEB 기반 운영 체제에서 다음 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 SCAP 파일의 위치를 확인합니다. dpkg -L <scap-security-guide-package-name-from-table> 요구사항에 적합한 SCAP 컨텐트 파일 한 개를 찾은 경우 클라이언트에서 사용 가능한 프로필을 나열합니다. oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds.xml Document type: Source Data Stream Imported: 2021-03-24T18:14:45 스트림: scap_org.open-scap_datastream_from_xccdf_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml 생성됨: (null) 버전: 1.2 체크리스트: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml 상태: draft 생성됨: 2021-03-24 해결됨: true 프로파일: 제목: CIS SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Benchmark Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis 제목: Standard System Security Profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard 제목: DISA STIG for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig 참조된 확인 파일: ssg-sle15-oval.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 ssg-sle15-ocil.xml system: http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2 https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/suse.linux.enterprise.15.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 확인: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-oval.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-ocil.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-oval.xml 사전: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-dictionary.xml 스캔을 수행하기 위한 파일 경로 및 프로파일을 기록해 둡니다. 컨텐트 파일을 설치 또는 전송하면 감사 스캔을 수행할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI를 사용하여 감사 스캔을 트리거할 수 있습니다. Uyuni API를 사용하여 정기 검사를 예약할 수도 있습니다. Procedure: Running an audit scan from the Web UI Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 시스템 목록으로 이동하여 스캔할 클라이언트를 선택합니다. 감사 탭으로 이동하여 일정 하위 탭으로 이동합니다. XCCDF 문서 경로 필드에 클라이언트에서 사용할 SCAP 템플릿 및 프로파일에 대한 파라미터를 입력합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. Command: /usr/bin/oscap xccdf eval Command-line arguments: --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig Path to XCCDF document: /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds.xml --fetch-remote-resources 파라미터를 사용하면 대량의 RAM이 필요합니다. 또한, file_recv_max_size 값을 늘려야 할 수도 있습니다. 스캔은 클라이언트의 다음번에 예약된 동기화 시 실행됩니다. XCCDF 컨텐트 파일은 유효성을 검사한 후 원격 시스템에서 실행됩니다. 컨텐트 파일에 잘못된 인수가 포함되면 테스트가 실패합니다. Procedure: Running an audit scan from the API 시작하기 전, 스캔할 클라이언트에 Python 및 XML-RPC 라이브러리가 설치되어 있는지 확인합니다. 기존 스크립트를 선택하거나 system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan을 통해 시스템 검사를 예약하기 위한 스크립트를 생성합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('https://server.example.com/rpc/api') key = client.auth.login('username', 'password') client.system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan(key, <1000010001>, '<path_to_xccdf_file.xml>', '--profile <profile_name>') client.auth.logout(session_key) 이 예에서: <1000010001>은 시스템 ID(sid)입니다. <path_to_xccdf_file.xml> is the path to the content file location on the client. For example, /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds.xml. <profile_name>은 oscap 명령에 대한 추가 인수입니다. 예를 들어, united_states_government_configuration_baseline(USGCB)을 사용합니다. 명령 프롬프트에서, 스캔할 클라이언트의 스크립트를 실행합니다. 실행한 검사에 대한 정보는 Uyuni Web UI에 있습니다. 결과 테이블을 확인하려면 감사 OpenSCAP 모든 스캔으로 이동합니다. 이 테이블의 데이터에 대한 자세한 내용은 All Scans에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 스캔에 대한 자세한 정보를 사용하려면 클라이언트에서 활성화해야 합니다.

SUSE는 권고 상태를 (\"최종\" 또는 \"안정\" 대신) \"철회\"로 설정하여 이러한 패치를 거의 즉시 취소하는 \"철회된 패치\"라는 새로운 메커니즘(2021년)을 도입했습니다. 패치의 권고 상태 특성이 \"철회\"로 설정되면 패치가 \"철회\"됩니다. 패키지는 \"철회된\" 패치에 속하는 경우 \"철회\"됩니다. 철회된 패치 또는 패키지는 Uyuni가 설치된 시스템에 설치할 수 없습니다. 철회된 패키지를 설치하는 유일한 방법은 zypper install을 사용하여 수동으로 설치하고 정확한 패키지 버전을 지정하는 것입니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. zypper install vim-8.0.1568-5.14.1 패치 및 패키지의 철회 상태는 Uyuni의 Web UI에 아이콘으로 표시됩니다. 다음 예시를 참조할 수 있습니다. 채널 내 패키지 목록 채널 내 패치 목록 시스템에 설치된 패치 또는 패키지가 철회되면 해당 시스템의 설치된 패키지 목록에 아이콘도 표시됩니다. Uyuni는 이러한 패치 또는 패키지를 다운그레이드할 수 있는 방법을 제공하지 않습니다. 복제된 채널을 사용하는 경우에는 철회된 권고 상태가 원래 채널에서 클론으로 전파되는 것에 주의해야 합니다. 벤더 채널을 조직에 복제하면 채널 패치도 복제됩니다. 벤더가 채널의 패치를 철회하고 Uyuni가 이 채널을 동기화하면(예: 야간 작업을 통해), \"철회됨\" 특성은 복제된 패치로 전파되지 않으며 복제된 채널에 가입한 클라이언트에게 표시되지 않습니다. 복제된 채널에 특성을 전파하려면 다음 방법을 사용할 수 있습니다. 패치 동기화(메뉴:소프트웨어[관리 > 복제된 채널 > 패치 > 동기화]). 이 기능을 사용하면 복제된 채널의 패치 특성을 원본에 맞출 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리의 컨텍스트에서 복제된 채널에 대한 자세한 내용은 소프트웨어 채널에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 조직에서 여러 벤더 채널 클론을 생성하면 패치가 여러 번 복제되지 않고 복제된 채널 간에 공유됩니다. 결과적으로 복제된 패치를 동기화할 때(패치 동기화 기능을 사용하거나 위에서 언급한 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리를 사용하여) 복제된 패치를 사용하는 모든 채널이 해당 변경사항을 따르게 됩니다. 예: 두 개의 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리 프로젝트 prj1 및 prj2를 생각해 보겠습니다. 이 두 프로젝트에는 dev 및 test의 두 가지 환경이 있습니다. 이러한 두 프로젝트에는 벤더 채널이 소스 채널로 설정되어 있습니다. 이 시나리오의 모든 채널(복제된 채널 총 네 개)은 벤더 채널의 최신 상태에 맞춰 정렬됩니다. 벤더는 소스 채널에서 패치를 철회하고 야간 작업 중에 Uyuni에 동기화합니다. 채널 네 개 모두 패치 클론을 사용하고 패치를 직접 사용하지 않으므로 이 변경사항을 볼 수 없습니다. 패치를 동기화하는 즉시(이러한 두 프로젝트 중 한 개를 빌드하거나 네 개의 복제된 채널에서 패치 동기화 기능을 사용), 패치 공유로 인해 복제된 채널 모두 패치가 철회된 것으로 표시됩니다.","title":"패치 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"patch-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/patch-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 철회된 패치","hash":"_철회된_패치","id":1},{"text":"1.1. 채널 클론","hash":"_채널_클론","id":2},{"text":"1.2. 패치 공유","hash":"_패치_공유","id":3}]},"35":{"id":35,"text":"SUSE는 고객에게 직접 배송되는 현재 지원되는 모든 솔루션에 대한 임시 수정 사항을 제공합니다. 이러한 PTF(프로그램 임시 수정)는 이제 리포지토리로 사용할 수 있으며 Uyuni에서 동기화할 수 있습니다.

In Uyuni, RBAC ensures that users can only perform actions and access resources for which they have explicit authorization, enhancing security and simplifying administration. The core principles of RBAC include: Principle of Least Privilege: Granting only the necessary access rights for users to perform their tasks. Granular Control: Providing fine-grained control over specific functionalities. Separation of Duties: Preventing a single user from having too much control over critical processes. Auditability: Allowing for clear tracking of user actions and permissions. Understanding the following core concepts is crucial for effective RBAC management: Role: A collection of permissions defining a specific set of capabilities within Uyuni. Roles are assigned to users, granting the user aggregated permissions. Permission: An atomic authorization to perform a specific action, access a specific web page or call a specific API endpoint within Uyuni. In Uyuni, permissions are represented by namespaces and their access modes. User: An individual account that interacts with Uyuni. Users are assigned one or more roles. Namespace: A granular unit of access control organized in a tree-like structure. Most namespaces have distinct \"View\" or \"Modify\" modes. Uyuni provides predefined roles and allows for the definition of additional custom roles, optionally inheriting from a combination of other roles. Refer to administration:users.adoc#administrator-roles for a complete list of predefined roles and their descriptions. To define additional roles, you can: Select a number of existing roles to inherit permissions from. Specify additional namespaces to grant access to. Namespaces provide fine-grained access control, organized in a tree-like structure. For most namespaces, access within a namespace is further granularized by \"View\" and \"Modify\" modes. Table 1. Example: Image Management namespaces and access modes Namespace Access Mode Description cm.build Modify Build container or Kiwi images cm.image.import Modify Import container images from a registered image store cm.image.list View List all images cm.image.list Modify Delete images cm.image.overview View View image details, patches, packages, build log and cluster information cm.image.overview Modify Inspect, rebuild, delete images cm.profile.details View View details of an image profile cm.profile.details Modify Create image profiles, edit profile details cm.profile.list View List all image profiles cm.profile.list Modify Delete image profiles cm.store.details View View details of an image store cm.store.details Modify Create image stores, edit store details cm.store.list View List all image stores cm.store.list Modify Delete image stores A comprehensive list of namespaces and their descriptions can be retrieved by making a call to the access.listNamespaces API method. Refer to Uyuni API documentation for detailed information, including request and response formats. Managing RBAC roles and permissions is currently only possible through the API. To assign roles to users via the web UI, refer to 사용자. The Uyuni API provides methods for programmaticaly managing roles, permissions and user assignments. These API methods manage roles and their associated access: listNamespaces: Lists available namespaces, access modes and their descriptions in Uyuni. listPermissions: Lists permitted namespaces of a role. listRoles: Lists existing roles in Uyuni. createRole: Creates a new role, optionally copying permissions from existing roles. deleteRole: Deletes a role. grantAccess: Grants access to namespaces. revokeAccess: Revokes access to namespaces. These API methods manage user-role assignments: listPermissions: Lists effective permissions of a user. listRoles: Lists a user’s assigned roles. addRole: Assigns a role to a user. removeRole: Removes a role from a user. For detailed API documentation, including request and response formats, refer to Uyuni API reference. Adhering to these best practices will help maintain a secure, efficient, and manageable RBAC environment: Principle of least privilege: Always grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their duties. Avoid overly broad permissions. Regular review: Periodically review assigned roles and permissions for users to ensure they are still appropriate and comply with current security policies. Document roles: Clearly document the purpose and permissions of each custom role you create. Separate duties: Implement roles that enforce separation of duties to prevent a single user from having too much control over critical processes.","title":"Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"role-based-access-control","url":"/uyuni/administration/role-based-access-control.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

SSL을 사용하여 Uyuni 서버에 등록하는 모든 클라이언트는 서버 인증서에 대해 유효성을 검사하여 올바른 서버에 연결하고 있는지 확인합니다. 이 프로세스를 SSL 핸드셰이크라고 합니다. SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 클라이언트는 서버 인증서의 호스트 이름이 필요한 이름과 일치하는지 확인합니다. 클라이언트는 또한 서버 인증서가 신뢰할 수 있는지 확인해야 합니다. 인증 기관(CA)은 다른 인증서에 서명하기 위해 사용되는 인증서입니다. 모든 인증서는 인증 기관(CA)에서 서명해야 유효한 것으로 간주되며 클라이언트가 인증서에 대해 일치시킬 수 있습니다. SSL 인증이 올바르게 작동하려면 클라이언트가 루트 CA를 신뢰해야 합니다. 즉, 루트 CA가 모든 클라이언트에 설치되어야 합니다. SSL 인증의 기본 방법은 Uyuni가 자체 서명 인증서를 사용하는 것입니다. 이 경우 Uyuni가 모든 인증서를 생성했으며 루트 CA가 서버 인증서에 직접 서명합니다. 중간 CA를 사용하는 방법도 있습니다. 이 경우 루트 CA는 중간 CA에 서명합니다. 그런 다음 중간 CA는 원하는 수의 다른 중간 CA에 서명할 수 있으며 마지막 CA는 서버 인증서에 서명합니다. 이를 체인 인증서라고 합니다. 연결된 인증서에서 중간 CA를 사용하는 경우, 루트 CA는 클라이언트에 설치되고 서버 인증서는 서버에 설치됩니다. SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 클라이언트는 루트 CA와 서버 인증서 사이의 전체 중간 인증서 체인을 확인할 수 있어야 하므로, 모든 중간 인증서에 액세스할 수 있어야 합니다. 이를 달성하는 두 가지 주요 방법이 있습니다. 이전 버전의 Uyuni에서는 기본적으로 모든 중간 CA가 클라이언트에 설치됩니다. 그러나 서버에서 서비스를 구성하여 클라이언트에 제공할 수도 있습니다. 이 경우 SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 서버는 서버 인증서와 모든 중간 CA를 제공합니다. 이제 이 방식이 기본 구성으로 사용됩니다. 기본적으로 Uyuni는 중간 CA 없이 자체 서명 인증서를 사용합니다. 추가 보안을 위해 인증서에 서명하도록 타사 CA를 지정할 수 있습니다. 타사 CA는 인증서에 검사를 수행하여 포함된 정보가 올바른지 확인합니다. 그리고 일반적으로 이 서비스에 대해 연간 요금을 청구합니다. 타사 CA를 사용하면 인증서를 스푸핑하기 더 어렵고 설치에 대한 추가 보호가 제공됩니다. 타사 CA에서 서명한 인증서가 있는 경우 Uyuni 설치로 임포트할 수 있습니다. 이 설명서에서는 SSL 인증서 사용을 2단계로 설명합니다. Uyuni 도구를 사용한 자체 서명 인증서 생성 방법 Uyuni 서버 또는 프록시에 인증서 배포 방법 자체 또는 외부 PKI와 같은 타사 인스턴스에서 인증서가 제공되는 경우 한 단계를 건너뛸 수 있습니다. 자체 서명 인증서 생성에 대한 자세한 내용은 자체 서명된 SSL 인증서에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 인증서 임포트에 대한 자세한 내용은 SSL 인증서 임포트에서 확인할 수 있습니다.

This setting forces Uyuni to choose a parent channel that best corresponds to the installed operating system, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, we recommend you create activation keys specific to each distribution and architecture. Bootstrapping With Activation Keys 부트스트랩 스크립트를 사용 중인 경우 각 스크립트에 대해 활성화 키를 생성하는 것을 고려하십시오. 이렇게 하면 채널 할당, 패키지 설치, 시스템 그룹 구성원, 구성 채널 할당을 조정하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 또한 등록 후 시스템에 대한 수동 개입이 덜 필요합니다. Bootstrapping LTSS Clients LTSS 구독을 사용하여 클라이언트를 부스트랩하는 경우 활성화 키 생성 중에 LTSS 채널을 포함시켜야 합니다. 대역폭 요구사항 활성화 키를 사용하면 등록 시점에 소프트웨어가 자동으로 다운로드될 수 있는데, 대역폭이 제한된 환경에서는 바람직하지 않을 수 있습니다. 이러한 옵션은 대역폭 사용량을 생성합니다. SUSE 제품 풀 채널을 할당하면 해당 제품 설명자 패키지가 자동으로 설치됩니다. 섹션의 모든 패키지가 Packages 설치됩니다. 구성 섹션의 모든 Salt 상태가 그 내용에 따라 다운로드를 트리거할 수 있습니다. 키 레이블 명명 활성화 키에 대해 읽을 수 있는 이름을 입력하지 않으면 시스템이 수 스트링을 자동으로 생성하므로 키를 관리하기 어려울 수 있습니다. 키를 추적하는 데 도움이 되는 활성화 키 명명 스키마를 고려하십시오. 조직의 인프라와 관련이 있는 이름을 생성하면 더 복잡한 작업을 더 쉽게 수행할 수 있습니다. 키 레이블을 생성할 때 다음과 같은 팁을 참고하십시오. OS 명명(필수): 키는 항상 자신이 설정을 제공하는 대상인 OS를 참조해야 합니다. 아키텍처 명명(권장): 귀사가 단 하나의 아키텍처(예: x86_64)만 운영하고 있지 않다면 레이블에 아키텍처 유형을 제공하는 것이 좋습니다. 서버 유형 명명: 이 서버를 어떤 목적으로 사용 중입니까? 위치 명명: 서버가 어디에 있습니까? 서버룸, 건물 또는 부서 내? 날짜 명명: 유지보수 기간, 분기 등 사용자 정의 명명: 어떤 명명 스키마가 조직의 필요에 적합합니까? 활성화 키 레이블 이름의 예: sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le 포함된 채널 활성화 키를 생성할 때는 어떤 소프트웨어 채널이 연결되어 있는지도 기억해 두어야 합니다. 키에는 할당된 특정 기본 채널이 있어야 합니다. 기본값으로 설정된 기본 채널은 사용하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 설치하려는 클라이언트 운영 체제를 참조하십시오.","title":"활성화 키","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"activation-keys","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/activation-keys.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 활성화 키","hash":"activation-keys-reactivation","id":1},{"text":"2. 활성화 키 모범 사례","hash":"_활성화_키_모범_사례","id":2}]},"53":{"id":53,"text":"AppStream 채널에 가입한 클라이언트를 관리하는 경우 Uyuni은 현재 활성화된 AppStream 모듈 세트에 따라 클라이언트에서 사용할 수 있는 패키지를 필터링합니다.

Cobbler에 저장된 배포 및 프로파일의 이름을 나열하려면 다음 명령을 실행합니다. mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list mgrctl exec -- cobbler profile list 부팅 ISO에는 모든 프로파일 및 시스템이 기본적으로 포함되어 있습니다. --profiles 및 --systems 옵션을 사용하면 사용되는 프로파일 및 시스템을 제한할 수 있습니다. mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso --systems=\"system1 system2 system3\" \\ --profiles=\"<your-profile1-label> <your-profile2-label> <your-profile3-label>\" \\ --distro=<your-distro-label> With --esp you can enable the built boot ISOs with Secure Boot. You explicitly specify the EFI System Partition (ESP). By default, Cobbler generates the ESP partition, which disables Secure Boot. mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso \\ --esp=\"/usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-15-SP6-x86_64/boot/x86_64/efi\" \\ --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro=<your-distro-label> Procedure: Finding efi On the container host, execute the following command to get the distro name: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list This command outputs strings such as sles15-sp6:1:SUSE. On the container host, execute the following command to get information about the distro files location: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro report --name sles15-sp6:1:SUSE This command outputs a report such as the following: Name : sles15-sp6:1:SUSE Architecture : x86_64 ...output omitted...

KIWI를 사용하여 SUSE 시스템을 설치하기 위한 대상 시스템에서 사용되는 부팅 가능한 ISO 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다. 시스템은 재부팅되거나 켜질 때 이 이미지로 부팅되고, Uyuni에서 AutoYaST 구성을 로드하며, AutoYaST 프로파일에 따라 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server를 설치합니다. ISO 이미지를 사용하려면 시스템을 부팅하고 프롬프트에 autoyast를 입력하십시오(AutoYaST 부팅을 위한 레이블을 autoyast 상태로 두었다고 가정함). Enter 키를 눌러 AutoYaST 설치를 시작합니다.

Uyuni의 패키지 검색 입력 상자에서 이름이 tftpboot-installation으로 시작하는 패키지를 검색한 후 패키지의 세부 정보를 확인합니다. 해당 정보는 /var/spacewalk/ 아래의 로컬 경로에 표시됩니다. 자동 설치 파일을 추출한 후의 단계는 자동 설치 가능한 배포판을 선언하는 것입니다. 절차: 자동 설치 가능한 배포판 선언 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 자동 설치 배포로 이동합니다. 배포 생성을 클릭하고 다음 필드를 입력합니다. 배포 레이블 필드에서 자동 설치 가능한 배포를 식별할 수 있는 이름을 입력합니다. 트리 경로 필드에서 Uyuni 서버에 저장된 설치 미디어의 경로를 입력합니다. 일치하는 기본 채널을 선택합니다. 설치 미디어와 일치해야 합니다. 설치 프로그램 생성을 선택합니다. 설치 미디어와 일치해야 합니다. 선택 사항: 이 배포를 부팅할 때 사용할 커널 옵션을 지정하십시오. 여러 가지 방식으로 커널 옵션을 제공할 수 있습니다. 배포에 일반적으로 사용되는 옵션만 여기에 추가하십시오. 자동 설치 가능한 배포판 생성을 클릭합니다. 준비한 설치 파일에는 설치에 필요한 패키지가 포함되지 않을 수 있습니다. 포함되지 않은 경우, useonlinerepo=1을 커널 옵션 필드에 추가합니다. 패키지 리포지토리에는 서명되지 않을 수 있는 메타데이터가 포함되어 있습니다. 메타데이터가 서명되지 않은 경우 insecure=1을 커널 옵션 필드에 추가하거나 자체 GPG 키 사용에서의 설명과 같이 자체 GPG 키를 사용합니다. 이러한 커널 옵션은 예를 들어 전체 DVD가 아닌 \"online installer\" ISO 이미지를 사용하거나 tpboot-installation 패키지를 사용할 때 필요합니다. 시스템 자동 설치 배포판으로 이동하여 자동 설치 가능한 배포판을 관리합니다. Uyuni은(는) 사용자가 지정한 커널 옵션을 결합할 수 있습니다. 이 작업은 특별한 상속 논리를 사용하여 수행됩니다. 이와 관련된 세 가지 객체 유형이 있습니다. 배포판(또는 줄임말 \"Distros\") 프로파일 시스템 최종 커널 옵션에 영향을 미치는 네 번째 특수 지점은 Cobbler 설정 파일 /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml입니다. Cobbler 설정 파일은 모든 배포판에 대한 기본 커널 옵션을 정의합니다. 이 옵션은 Uyuni의 컨텍스트에서는 지원되지 않습니다. 커널 옵션을 효과적으로 관리하기 위해서는 원시 값과 확인된 값을 이해하는 것이 중요합니다. 원시 값: 이러한 값은 특정 Cobbler 항목에 직접 연결되어 Cobbler의 내부 데이터베이스에 있는 그대로 저장된 값을 의미합니다. 확인된 값: 이러한 값은 Cobbler 항목의 상속 계층 구조를 고려하여 런타임에 동적으로 생성됩니다. 옵션 앞에 !를 추가하면 최종 커널 명령줄에서 옵션이 제거됩니다. 프로파일과 시스템의 커널 옵션은 둘 다 Uyuni에서 관리됩니다. 따라서 배포판의 커널 옵션만 편집 가능할 수 있습니다. 배포판 원시 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 self_update=0 프로파일 원시 값 console=tty1 시스템 원시 값 console=ttyS0 이 프로파일을 상속하는 시스템의 확인된 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 self_update=0 console=ttyS0 배포판 원시 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 self_update=0 프로파일 원시 값 console=tty1 시스템 원시 값 !self_update 이 프로파일을 상속하는 시스템의 확인된 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 console=ttyS0","title":"자동 설치 가능한 배포판","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-distributions","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-distributions.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Kickstart 프로파일은 매우 다양한 구성 옵션을 제공합니다. 이러한 프로파일을 생성하려면 해당 프로파일을 업로드하거나 전용 마법사를 사용합니다. Kickstart 프로파일을 사용하면 파일 보관 목록을 사용할 수 있습니다. Kickstart를 사용하여 다시 설치할 클라이언트에 사용자 정의 구성 파일이 여러 개 있는 경우 해당 파일을 목록으로 저장하고 사용할 Kickstart 프로파일과 이 목록을 연결할 수 있습니다. 절차: 파일 보관 목록 생성 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 자동 설치 파일 보관으로 이동하여 파일 유지 목록 생성을 클릭합니다. 적절한 레이블을 입력하고 저장하려는 모든 파일 및 디렉토리의 절대 경로를 나열합니다. 목록 생성을 클릭합니다. Kickstart 프로파일에 파일 보관 목록을 포함시킵니다. 시스템 자동 설치 프로파일로 이동한 후 편집할 프로파일을 선택하고 시스템 세부 정보 파일 보관 하위 탭으로 이동하여 포함할 파일 보관 목록을 선택합니다. 파일 유지 목록은 전체 크기가 1 MB로 제한됩니다. /dev/hda1 및 /dev/sda1과 같은 특수 장치는 보관할 수 없습니다. 파일 및 디렉토리 이름만 사용하십시오. 정규식 와일드카드는 사용할 수 없습니다. Kickstart에 대한 자세한 설명은 Red Hat 문서를 참조하십시오. 설치 파일의 일부는 설치 중에 대체됩니다. 변수는 단일 값으로 대체되며 코드 조각은 텍스트의 전체 섹션으로 대체됩니다. 이스케이프된 기호 또는 섹션은 대체되지 않습니다. Cheetah라는 템플릿 엔진을 사용하면 Cobbler가 해당 대체를 수행할 수 있습니다. 이 방식을 통해 각각에 대한 프로파일을 수동으로 생성할 필요 없이 대량의 시스템을 다시 설치할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 자동 설치 변수 및 코드 조각을 생성할 수 있습니다. 프로파일의 자동 설치 파일 탭을 사용하면 대체 결과를 확인할 수 있습니다. 변수에 대한 설명은 변수를 참조하십시오. 코드 조각에 대한 설명은 코드 조각을 참조하십시오. 이스케이프 기호 또는 텍스트 블록에 대한 설명은 이스케이핑을 참조하십시오. 자동 설치 변수를 사용해 값을 Kickstart 및 AutoYaST 프로파일로 대신할 수 있습니다. 변수를 정의하려면 프로파일에서 변수 하위 탭으로 이동하여 텍스트 상자에서 name=value 쌍을 생성합니다. 예를 들어, 클라이언트의 IP 주소를 가진 변수와 게이트웨이의 주소를 가진 변수를 생성할 수 있습니다. 그러면 이러한 변수를 동일한 프로파일에서 설치된 모든 클라이언트에 대해 정의할 수 있습니다. 이 작업을 수행하려면 변수 텍스트 상자에 다음 줄을 추가합니다. ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 변수를 사용하려면 프로파일에서 $ 기호를 앞에 추가하여 변수를 대체합니다. 예를 들어, Kickstart 파일의 네트워크 부분은 다음과 같습니다. network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway $ipaddr은 192.168.0.28로, $gateway는 192.168.0.1로 확인됩니다. 설치 파일에서 변수는 계층 구조를 사용합니다. 시스템 변수는 프로파일 변수에 우선하고, 프로파일 변수는 배포 변수에 우선합니다. Uyuni는 미리 정의된 다양한 코드 조각과 함께 제공됩니다. 시스템 자동 설치 자동 설치 조각으로 이동하여 기존 조각의 목록을 확인합니다. 자동 설치 파일에 $SNIPPET() 매크로를 삽입하여 코드 조각을 사용합니다. 예를 들어, Kickstart에서는 다음과 같습니다. $SNIPPET('spacewalk/redhat_register_using_salt') 또는 AutoYaST에서는 다음과 같습니다. <init-scripts config:type=\"list\"> $SNIPPET('spacewalk/minion_script') </init-scripts> 매크로는 Cobbler로 구문 분석되고 코드 조각의 컨텐트로 대체됩니다. 또한 나중에 자동 설치 파일에서 사용할 자체 코드 조각을 저장할 수 있습니다. 조각 생성을 클릭하여 새 코드 조각을 생성하십시오. 다음 예에서는 일반 하드 드라이브 파티션 구성에 대한 Kickstart 코드 조각을 다음과 같이 설정합니다. clearpart --all part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary part swap --recommended part pv.00 --size=1 --grow volgroup vg00 pv.00 logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000 예를 들어, 다음과 같이 코드 조각을 사용합니다. $SNIPPET('my_partition') 자동 설치 파일에 $(example)와(과) 같은 셸 스크립트 변수가 포함된 경우 백슬래시를 사용하여 컨텐트를 이스케이프해야 합니다. \\$(example). $ 기호를 이스케이프하면 템플릿 엔진이 기호를 내부 변수로 평가하지 못하게 됩니다. 코드 조각이나 스크립트와 같은 텍스트 블록은 \\#raw 및 \\#end raw 지시어로 래핑하여 이스케이프할 수 있습니다. 예: #raw #!/bin/bash for i in {0..2}; do echo \"$i - Hello World!\" done #end raw # 기호 다음에 공백이 있는 모든 줄은 주석으로 취급되므로 평가되지 않습니다. 예: # 특정 섹션 시작(주석임) echo \"Hello, world\" # 특정 섹션 종료(주석임)","title":"자동 설치 프로파일","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-profiles","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-profiles.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 프로파일 선언","hash":"declare-profile","id":1},{"text":"2.

Ensure you specify the correct architecture: mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-common-channels \\ -a <architecture> \\ <base_channel_name> \\ <child_channel_name_1> \\ <child_channel_name_2> \\ ... <child_channel_name_n> If automatic synchronization is turned off, synchronize the channels on the container host with the following command: mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-repo-sync -p <base_channel_label>-<architecture> 계속하기 전에 동기화가 완료되었는지 확인합니다. spacewalk-common-channels가 제공하는 클라이언트 도구 채널은 SUSE가 아닌 Uyuni가 공급합니다. 모듈형 채널을 사용하는 경우 클라이언트에서 Python 3.6 모듈 스트림을 활성화해야 합니다.Python 3.6이 제공되지 않으면 spacecmd 패키지의 설치가 실패합니다. AppStream 채널에서 사용할 수 있는 패키지의 수가 업스트림과 Uyuni 채널 간에 서로 약간 불일치함을 알 수 있습니다. 또한 다른 시점에 추가한 동일 채널을 비교하면 그 수가 다른 것을 알 수 있습니다. 이는 CentOS가 리포지토리를 관리하는 방식에 원인이 있습니다. CentOS는 새 버전이 릴리스되면 이전 버전의 패키지를 제거하지만 Uyuni는 사용 기간과 관계없이 모두 그대로 유지합니다. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Web UI Uyuni Web UI에서 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동한 다음, 리포지토리에 연결된 채널을 클릭합니다. 리포지토리 탭으로 이동한 다음, 동기화를 클릭하고 동기화 상태를 확인합니다. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt To list available logs before tailing, on the container host, run the following command: mgrctl exec ls /var/log/rhn/reposync/ At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization of a channel log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. CentOS 채널에 연결된 활성화 키를 생성해야 합니다. 활성화 키에 대한 자세한 내용은 활성화 키를 참조하십시오. 클라이언트는 소프트웨어 패키지가 설치되기 전에 GPG 키를 사용해 신뢰성을 확인합니다. 신뢰할 수 있는 소프트웨어만 클라이언트에 설치할 수 있습니다. 클라이언트의 보안을 위해 GPG 키를 신뢰하는 것이 중요합니다. 어떤 키가 필요하고 신뢰할 수 있는지 결정하는 것은 관리자가 수행해야 하는 작업입니다. GPG 키를 신뢰할 수 없는 경우 소프트웨어 채널을 사용할 수 없기 때문에 채널을 클라이언트에 할당하는 결정은 키를 신뢰하는 결정에 따라 달라집니다. GPG 키에 대한 자세한 내용은 GPG 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. CentOS 7 will fail to onboard due to the fact that the /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo has URLs enabled, and thus causing yum to attempt to find the repositories using fastmirror. This will cause the bootstrap to fail with the error message: Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error To avoid the issue you can remove the CentOS-Base.repo file with the command: rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo Or, if the file needs to remain, you can add enabled=0 to each of the URL sections. In either case, then rebootstrap. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt on the container host: mgrctl exec -ti mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 클라이언트 등록에 대한 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 참조하십시오. 이 섹션은 컨테이너화되지 않은 Uyuni에만 적용되며, CentOS 7의 수명 종료 이후에 제거됩니다.

Debian 클라이언트를 설치하려면 여러 개의 GPG 키가 필요할 수 있습니다. 타사 Debian 리포지토리를 동기화하는 경우 서버에서 적절한 GPG 키를 가져와야 합니다. GPG 키가 누락되면 동기화에 실패합니다. Debian 리포지토리의 경우, 메타데이터만 서명됩니다. 그러므로 소프트웨어 채널용 GPG 키를 가져올 필요가 없습니다. Uyuni는 패키지에 다시 서명하지 않습니다. Uyuni 서버로 이미 임포트한 GPG 키를 살펴보려면 다음 명령을 실행합니다. mgrctl exec -- gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys 새 GPG 키를 임포트하려면 다음 명령을 실행합니다. mgradm gpg add <filename>.gpg Debian의 루트 사용자는 SSH 액세스에 대해 기본적으로 비활성화되어 있습니다. 일반 사용자를 사용하여 온보딩하려면 sudoers 파일을 편집해야 합니다. 절차: 루트 사용자에게 액세스 권한 부여 클라이언트에서 다음과 같이 sudoers 파일을 편집합니다. sudo visudo 이 줄을 sudoers 파일 끝에 추가하여 사용자에게 sudo 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 다음과 같이 <user>를 Web UI에서 클라이언트를 부트스트래핑하고 있는 사용자의 이름으로 교체합니다. <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 이 절차는 클라이언트 등록에 필요한 비밀번호가 없어도 루트에 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 클라이언트는 성공적으로 설치된 후 루트 권한으로 실행되므로 액세스 권한이 더 이상 필요 없습니다. 클라이언트가 성공적으로 설치된 후 sudoers 파일에서 이 줄을 제거하는 것이 좋습니다.

GPG 키 정보가 있는 소프트웨어 채널이 클라이언트에 할당되면 채널을 새로 고치거나 이 채널에서 첫 번째 패키지를 설치할 때 키가 신뢰됩니다. 소프트웨어 채널 페이지의 GPG 키 URL 파라미터에는 \"공백\"으로 구분된 여러 키 URL이 포함될 수 있습니다. 파일 URL인 경우 클라이언트에 GPG 키 파일을 배포한 후 소프트웨어 채널을 사용해야 합니다. Red Hat 기반 클라이언트의 클라이언트 도구 채널에 대한 GPG 키는 클라이언트의 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/에 배포되며 파일 URL로 참조할 수 있습니다. 소프트웨어 채널이 클라이언트에 할당된 경우에만 시스템에서 가져와서 신뢰하게 됩니다.

SUSE Linux Enterprise 채널은 규모가 매우 클 수 있습니다. 때로 동기화에 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. 클라이언트는 소프트웨어 패키지가 설치되기 전에 GPG 키를 사용해 신뢰성을 확인합니다. 신뢰할 수 있는 소프트웨어만 클라이언트에 설치할 수 있습니다. 클라이언트의 보안을 위해 GPG 키를 신뢰하는 것이 중요합니다. 어떤 키가 필요하고 신뢰할 수 있는지 결정하는 것은 관리자가 수행해야 하는 작업입니다. GPG 키를 신뢰할 수 없는 경우 소프트웨어 채널을 사용할 수 없기 때문에 채널을 클라이언트에 할당하는 결정은 키를 신뢰하는 결정에 따라 달라집니다. GPG 키에 대한 자세한 내용은 GPG 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 및 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 클라이언트에 동일한 GPG 키를 사용합니다. 올바른 키는 sle12-gpg-pubkey-39db7c82.key입니다. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.

Ubuntu의 루트 사용자는 SSH 액세스에 대해 기본적으로 비활성화되어 있습니다. 일반 사용자를 사용하여 온보딩하려면 sudoers 파일을 편집해야 합니다. 이 문제는 Ubuntu의 자체 설치 버전에서 발생합니다. 설치 중에 기본 사용자에게 관리자 권한이 부여된 경우 sudo를 사용하여 권한 에스컬레이션을 수행하려면 비밀번호가 필요합니다. 클라우드 인스턴스에서는 이런 일이 발생하지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 cloud-init는 /etc/sudoers.d 아래에 자동으로 파일을 생성하고 비밀번호를 사용할 필요 없이 sudo를 사용하여 권한 에스컬레이션을 부여하기 때문입니다. 절차: 루트 사용자에게 액세스 권한 부여 클라이언트에서 다음과 같이 sudoers 파일을 편집합니다. sudo visudo 이 줄을 sudoers 파일 끝에 추가하여 사용자에게 sudo 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 다음과 같이 <user>를 Web UI에서 클라이언트를 부트스트래핑하고 있는 사용자의 이름으로 교체합니다. <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 이 절차는 클라이언트 등록에 필요한 비밀번호가 없어도 루트에 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 클라이언트는 성공적으로 설치된 후 루트 권한으로 실행되므로 액세스 권한이 더 이상 필요 없습니다. 클라이언트가 성공적으로 설치된 후 sudoers 파일에서 이 줄을 제거하는 것이 좋습니다. To bootstrap an Ubuntu client via SSH you must add the install-created user to the sudo group. Then run the bootstrap script from the client. Procedure: Adding Install-created User to sudo Group and Bootstrapping via SSH On the client, as root, run from the command line (replace <username> with the name of the install-created user): sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> Bootstrap the client system from its command line (replace <SERVER_FQDN> with the fully qualified domain name of the Uyuni Server): sudo su - curl -Sks https://<SERVER_FQDN>/pub/bootstrap/bootstrap-script.sh | /bin/bash Ubuntu can only be bootstrapped using the corresponding Ubuntu bootstrap script run from the client system’s command line after issuing sudo su - as above. It cannot be bootstrapped via the Uyuni Web UI due to the fact that the root user is disabled on Ubuntu by default, and that the Web UI does not permit for privilege escalation of the Ubuntu install-created user. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.

Salt 통신 소프트웨어 옵션 구현: Salt 번들(venv-salt-minion) is a single binary package containing Salt Minion, Python 3, required Python modules, and libraries. Thus the Salt contact method is independent from software installed on the client. For more information, see Salt Bundle. Salt Minion(salt-minion) is Salt software installed on the client system and it is no longer supported with Uyuni in general. If needed, you can install it on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 clients and derivatives (like SLE Micro) for bootstrapping only. Then, during bootstrapping it will be replaced with venv-salt-minion. Uyuni 5.0 이상에서는 기존 연락 프로토콜이 더 이상 지원되지 않습니다. 기존 프록시를 포함한 모든 기존 클라이언트를 Salt로 마이그레이션하거나 Salt 프록시로 바꾼 후 Uyuni 4에서 5로 업그레이드해야 합니다. 기존 Uyuni 4 클라이언트를 Salt 클라이언트로 마이그레이션하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html에서 확인할 수 있습니다.","title":"클라이언트 연락 방법","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-intro","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-intro.html","titles":[]},"99":{"id":99,"text":"Salt 번들은 Salt Minion, Python 3, 필수 Python 모듈 및 라이브러리가 포함된 단일 바이너리 패키지입니다. Salt 번들은 Python 3과 Salt가 실행되기 위한 모든 요구사항과 함께 제공됩니다. 따라서 Salt 번들은 클라이언트에 설치된 Python 버전을 시스템 소프트웨어로 사용하지 않습니다. 해당 Salt 버전에 대한 요구사항을 충족하지 않는 클라이언트에도 Salt 번들을 설치할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Salt Master가 아닌 Salt Master에 연결된 Salt Minion을 실행하는 시스템에서도 Salt 번들을 사용할 수 있습니다. The registration method with the Salt Bundle is the recommended registration method. This section explains the advantages and limitations of the current implementation. The Salt Bundle is provided as the venv-salt-minion package that consists of Salt, Python 3, and the Python modules Salt depends on. Bootstrapping with Web UI is using Salt Bundle as well, so bootstrapping with Web UI is not Python dependant. Using the Salt Bundle, it is no longer needed that the client provides any Python interpreter or modules. 새 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하는 경우 Salt Bundle에 등록하는 것이 기본 방법입니다. 기존 클라이언트를 Salt Bundle 방식으로 전환할 수 있습니다. 전환하면 salt-minion 패키지와 종속 항목이 설치된 상태로 유지됩니다. Salt 번들은 Salt와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다. 미니언이 관리하는 Salt Master 이외의 Uyuni 서버에서 동시에 사용할 수 있습니다. Salt 번들을 클라이언트에 설치한 경우 Uyuni 서버가 Salt 번들의 구성 파일을 관리하게 되며, 이 경우 salt-minion의 구성 파일은 관리되지 않습니다. 자세한 내용은 Salt 번들 구성에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Uyuni 서버가 아닌 Salt Master가 관리하는 Salt 미니언을 사용하여 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하려면 클라이언트를 Salt로 부트스트랩하려면 부트스트랩 스크립트 생성 시 mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle을 사용하거나 부트스트랩 스크립트에서 FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION을 1로 설정하는 것이 좋습니다. Web UI mgr_force_venv_salt_minion이 true로 설정된 부트스트래핑의 경우 열을 전역적으로 지정할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 Salt States and Pillars에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Salt 상태 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 사용하여 salt-minion에서 venv-salt-minion으로 전환할 수 있습니다. 프로세스 이동 문제를 방지하려면 두 단계에 걸쳐 venv-salt-minion으로 전환하는 것이 좋습니다. Procedure: SwitchingWwith util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion State to venv-salt-minion 우선 열을 지정하지 않고 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 적용하십시오. 그러면 구성 파일 등을 복사하는 venv-salt-minion으로 전환됩니다. 원래 salt-minion 구성 및 해당 패키지는 정리되지 않습니다. salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion mgr_purge_non_venv_salt가 True로 설정된 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 적용하여 salt-minion을 제거하고 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files을 True로 설정하여 salt-minion과 관련된 모든 파일을 제거하십시오. 이 두 번째 단계는 첫 번째 단계가 처리되었는지 확인한 후 이전 구성 파일과 더 이상 사용되지 않는 salt-minion 패키지를 제거합니다. salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' In case of running the second step only and the first step, state apply process could fail as it requires stopping the salt-minion which is used to execute the command on the client side. It is also possible to avoid installing the Salt Bundle and keep using salt-minion instead. In this case, specify one of these options: --no-bundle 옵션으로 mgr-bootstrap을 실행하십시오. 생성된 부트스트랩 스크립트에서 AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION을 1로 설정합니다. For bootstrap state set the mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion pillar to True in /srv/pillar/salt_bundle_config.sls. Salt 번들은 클라이언트로 SSH Push 작업을 수행할 때도 사용됩니다. 셸 스크립트는 Salt 명령이 실행되기 전에 venv-salt-minion을 설치하지 않고 대상 시스템에 Salt 번들을 배포합니다. Salt 번들에는 전체 Salt 코드 베이스가 포함되어 있으므로 salt-thin은 배포되지 않습니다. SSH Push(Web UI를 사용한 부트스트랩 포함)는 번들 내의 Python 3 인터프리터를 사용합니다. 대상 시스템에는 다른 Python 인터프리터가 설치되어 있지 않아도 됩니다. 번들과 함께 배포된 Python 3은 클라이언트에서 SSH Push 세션을 처리하는 데 사용되므로 SSH Push(Web UI를 사용한 부트스트랩 포함)는 시스템에 설치된 Python에 종속되지 않습니다. 다른 방법으로 salt-thin을 사용할 수 있지만, 클라이언트에 Python 3이 설치되어 있어야 합니다. 이 방법은 권장되거나 지원되지 않으며 개발 목적으로만 존재합니다. web.ssh_use_salt_thin을 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 구성 파일에서 true로 설정합니다. 부트스트랩 리포지토리는 Web UI를 사용하여 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하기 전에 생성해야 합니다. SSH Push는 감지된 대상 운영 체제를 기반으로 부트스트랩 리포지토리에서 가져온 Salt 번들을 사용합니다. 자세한 내용은 client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository에서 확인할 수 있습니다. SSH Push는 /var/tmp를 사용하여 번들된 Python을 사용하여 클라이언트에서 Salt 명령을 실행하기 위해 Salt 번들을 배포합니다. 따라서 noexec 옵션으로 /var/tmp를 마운트하지 않아야 합니다. noexec 옵션을 사용하여 /var/tmp가 마운트된 클라이언트는 부트스트랩 프로세스가 SSH Push를 사용하여 클라이언트에 도달하기 때문에 Web UI를 사용하여 부트스트랩할 수 없습니다. Salt 번들에는 pip이 포함되어 있어 번들된 Salt 미니언의 기능을 추가 Python 패키지로 확장할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 salt <minion_id> pip.install <package-name> 은 <package_name>에 의해 지정된 Python 패키지를 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local에 설치합니다. 필요한 경우 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local 경로는 venv-salt-minion.service에 대한 VENV_PIP_TARGET 환경 변수를 설정하여 재정의할 수 있습니다. 서비스에 대한 systemd drop-in 구성 파일을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 이는 구성 파일 /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf를 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다. [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip pip을 사용하여 설치된 Python 패키지는 Salt 번들을 업데이트할 때 변경되지 않습니다. 업데이트 후에도 해당 패키지를 사용할 수 있고 정상적으로 작동하도록 하려면 Salt 번들 업데이트 후 Salt 상태를 적용하여 설치하는 것이 좋습니다.","title":"Salt Bundle","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In other words: SSH Push (with tunnel) also creates a reverse tunnel from the client to the Uyuni Server, not only from the server to the client. 서버는 SSH를 사용해 정기적으로 클라이언트에 연결하여 체크인하고 예약된 작업과 이벤트를 수행합니다. 프로비저닝 모델을 사용하여 시스템을 다시 설치하는 것은 현재 SSH Push로 관리되는 클라이언트에서는 지원되지 않습니다. 터널은 암호화된 터널을 통해 서버로의 액세스를 제공하기 위해 사용됩니다. SSH 푸시 클라이언트(터널 사용)에 할당된 리포지토리는 이 터널을 통해서만 제공되므로 터널이 작동하는 동안에만 리포지토리를 사용할 수 있으므로 클라이언트 시스템에서 직접 패키지 관리자 도구를 사용할 수 없습니다. 즉, 서버에서 세션을 시작한 경우에만 액세스가 가능합니다. 클라이언트의 모든 패키지 관리 작업은 서버 쪽에서만 수행할 수 있습니다.

Therefore also SSH Push (with tunnel) is available as contact method. That also opens a reverse tunnel and thus you can communicate through all firewalls which otherwise might block the connection from client to server. SSH 푸시는 클라이언트에 데몬 에이전트를 설치할 수 없는 경우에도 사용할 수 있습니다. SSH 푸시 방법에는 심각한 제한이 있습니다. 크기 조정이 원활하지 않으며, 일반 Salt 방법(기본값)보다 더 많은 서버 리소스와 네트워크 대역폭을 소비합니다. 푸시 SSH 방식은 대규모 설정(1000명 이상의 클라이언트)의 경우에는 전혀 지원되지 않습니다. 서버는 SSH Push를 사용하여 정기적으로 클라이언트에 연락해 체크인하고 예약된 작업과 이벤트를 수행합니다. 프로비저닝 모델을 사용하여 시스템을 다시 설치하는 것은 현재 SSH Push로 관리되는 클라이언트에서는 지원되지 않습니다. 이 이미지는 SSH Push 프로세스 경로를 보여줍니다. Taskomatic 블록의 왼쪽에 있는 모든 항목은 Uyuni 클라이언트에서 실행 중인 프로세스를 나타냅니다. SSH Push를 사용하려면 클라이언트에서 실행 중인 SSH 데몬이 있어야 하며, Uyuni 서버에서 실행 중인 salt-api 데몬에 연결할 수 있어야 합니다. 또한 요구사항에 해당하는 Python 버전이 클라이언트 시스템에 Salt 번들과 함께 배포됩니다. 다음 등록 절차를 시작하기 전에 SSH 푸시 연락 방법을 구성하여 활성화 키를 정의합니다. 이 방법에서는 서버에 HTTPS로 직접 연결해야 합니다. 이러한 클라이언트를 Uyuni 서버에 등록하려면 Web UI 또는 API를 사용해야 합니다. 다음 절차 또는 예제를 참조하십시오.

To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart the Uyuni Server as root. Outside of the container, from the container host, enter: mgradm restart SSH Push 기능은 taskomatic을 사용하여 salt-ssh를 수행해 예약된 작업을 실행합니다. taskomatic 작업은 주기적으로 예약된 작업을 확인하고 실행합니다. SSH Push 기능은 예약된 작업을 기반으로 완전한 salt-ssh 호출을 실행합니다. 기본적으로 한 번에 20건의 Salt SSH 작업을 실행할 수 있습니다. 구성 파일에 다음과 같은 줄을 추가하고 parallel_threads의 값을 상향 조정하여 병렬로 실행할 수 있는 작업의 수를 늘릴 수 있습니다. 문제를 방지하기 위해 병렬 작업의 수를 다음과 같이 낮게 유지하는 것이 좋습니다. taskomatic.sshminion_action_executor.parallel_threads = <number> org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = <value of parallel_threads + 20> 이렇게 하여 어느 한 곳의 클라이언트에서 병렬로 실행할 수 있는 작업의 수와 Taskomatic이 사용하는 작업자 스레드의 총 개수를 조정할 수 있습니다. 작업을 여러 클라이언트에서 실행해야 하는 경우 작업은 항상 각 클라이언트에서 순차적으로 실행됩니다. 클라이언트가 프록시를 통해 연결되어 있는 경우 프록시에서 MaxSessions 설정을 조정해야 합니다. 이 경우 병렬 연결의 수를 클라이언트 총 수의 세 배로 설정합니다.

Debian 기반 시스템은 메타데이터에만 서명하므로 단일 채널에 대해 추가 키를 지정할 필요가 없습니다. 리포지토리 메타데이터에서 \"자체 GPG 키 사용\"의 설명과 같이 사용자가 자체 GPG 키를 구성하여 메타데이터에 서명하는 경우 해당 키의 배포 및 신뢰가 자동으로 실행됩니다. 사용자는 클라이언트에 배포할 사용자 정의 GPG 키를 정의할 수 있습니다. 일부 열 데이터를 제공하고 Salt 파일 시스템에 GPG 키 파일을 제공하면 클라이언트에 자동으로 배포됩니다. 이러한 키는 RPM 기반 운영 체제의 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/및 Debian 시스템의 /usr/share/keyrings/에 배포됩니다. 키를 배포할 클라이언트에 대한 열 키 custom_gpgkeys를 정의하고 키 파일의 이름을 나열합니다. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg 추가적으로 Salt 파일 시스템에서 gpg 디렉토리를 생성한 후 해당 디렉토리에 custom_gpgkeys 열 데이터에 지정된 이름으로 GPG 키 파일을 저장합니다. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 키는 클라이언트에 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 및 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg에 배포됩니다. 마지막 단계로 소프트웨어 채널의 GPG 키 URL 필드에 URL을 추가합니다. 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하고 수정할 채널을 선택합니다. GPG 키 URL에 file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 값을 추가합니다. 절차: 부트스트랩 스크립트를 사용하여 클라이언트의 GPG 키 신뢰 Uyuni 서버의 명령 프롬프트에서 /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ 디렉토리의 내용을 확인합니다. 이 디렉토리에는 사용 가능한 모든 공용 키가 포함되어 있습니다. 등록하려는 클라이언트에 할당된 채널에 적용되는 키를 적어 두십시오. 관련 부트스트랩 스크립트를 열어 ORG_GPG_KEY= 파라미터를 찾고 필요한 키를 추가합니다. 예: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key 이전에 저장한 키는 삭제하지 않아도 됩니다. 클라이언트의 보안을 위해 GPG 키의 신뢰성이 중요합니다. 어떤 키가 필요하고 신뢰할 수 있는지 결정하는 것은 관리자가 수행해야 하는 작업입니다. GPG 키를 신뢰할 수 없으면 클라이언트에 소프트웨어 채널을 할당할 수 없습니다.","title":"GPG 키","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"gpg-keys","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/gpg-keys.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 클라이언트의 GPG 키 신뢰","hash":"_클라이언트의_gpg_키_신뢰","id":1},{"text":"1.1.

A package can become orphaned as a result of one of the following events: A synchronized repository removes a package. By default, Uyuni unlinks such a package from the channel, but does not remove the package. 리포지토리는 패키지를 최신 버전으로 대체하므로 이전 버전이 제거됩니다. (공간 부족 예외 사항 등으로 인해) 재동기화 프로세스가 중단되었으며, 따라서 다운로드한 패키지가 채널에 연결되지 않았습니다. 사용자가 패키지를 수동으로 업로드했지만 채널과 연결하지 않았습니다. 독립 패키지는 사용자 환경의 공간을 차지하며, 채널과 연결되어 있지 않으므로 클라이언트에 쉽게 배포할 수 없습니다. 독립 패키지는 부트스트랩 또는 고객별 절차와 같은 특정 워크플로에 적합할 수 있습니다. You can view orphaned packages in the Web UI by clicking Software Manage Packages view Packages in no channel. Uyuni periodically runs a taskomatic job that searches for orphaned packages and modifies the package organization ID to 1. This means that you can delete orphaned packages only after the taskomatic job execution. If you encounter an orphaned package that you cannot delete, wait 24 hours and try the deletion again. Delete orphaned packages: with command line tools targeting individual packages.

Procedure: Registering Clients With the Web UI Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 부트스트랩으로 이동합니다. 호스트 필드에 부트스트랩할 클라이언트의 정규화된 도메인 이름(FQDN)을 입력합니다. SSH 포트 필드에서 클라이언트를 연결하고 부트스트랩하는 데 사용할 SSH 포트 번호를 입력합니다. 기본적으로 SSH 포트는 22입니다. 사용자 필드에서 클라이언트에 로그인할 사용자 이름을 입력합니다. 기본적으로 사용자 이름은 root입니다. Select an Authentication method: To bootstrap the client with an SSH key, in the Authentication field, check SSH Private Key, and upload the SSH private key to use to log in to the client. SSH 개인 키에 암호문이 필요한 경우 SSH 개인 키 암호문 필드에 입력하십시오. 또는 어떤 암호문에 대해서도 이 필드를 공백 상태로 두지 마십시오. 비밀번호로 클라이언트를 부트스트래핑하려면 인증 필드에서 비밀번호를 확인하고 비밀번호를 입력하여 클라이언트에 로그인하십시오. 활성화 키 필드에서 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하는 데 사용할 소프트웨어 채널과 연결된 활성화 키를 선택합니다. 자세한 내용은 활성화 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 옵션: 프록시 필드에서 클라이언트를 등록할 프록시를 선택합니다. 기본적으로 SSH Strict 키 호스트 점검 비활성화 확인란이 선택되어 있습니다. 따라서 사용자가 수동으로 인증할 필요 없이 부트스트랩 프로세스가 자동으로 SSH 호스트 키를 수락할 수 있습니다. 옵션: SSH를 통해 시스템을 완전히 관리 확인란을 선택합니다. If you check this option, the client is configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other contact method is configured. For more information about contact methods, see 클라이언트 연락 방법. 부트스트랩을 클릭하여 등록을 시작합니다. 부트스트랩 프로세스가 완료되면 클라이언트가 시스템 시스템 목록에 나열됩니다. SSH 개인 키는 부트스트래핑 프로세스가 진행되는 중에만 저장되며, 부트스트래핑이 완료되자마자 Uyuni 서버에서 삭제됩니다. Uyuni를 사용해 클라이언트에 새 패키지 또는 업데이트를 설치하면 최종 사용자 라이선스 계약(EULA)이 자동으로 수락됩니다. 패키지 EULA를 검토하려면 Web UI에서 패키지 상세 정보 페이지를 여십시오. Uyuni에서 제공하지 않는 클라이언트에 리포지토리를 직접 할당하는 것은 일반적인 사용 사례가 아닙니다. 이로 인해 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 그러므로 Salt를 통한 부트스트래핑은 부트스트랩 프로세스를 시작할 때 모든 로컬 리포지토리를 비활성화합니다. 나중에 Highstate 또는 패키지 설치를 실행할 때처럼 채널 상태를 사용할 때마다 로컬에 할당된 모든 리포지토리가 다시 비활성화됩니다. 클라이언트에서 사용되는 모든 소프트웨어 패키지는 Uyuni에서 제공하는 채널에서 가져와야 합니다. 사용자 정의 채널을 생성하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 사용자 정의 채널에서 사용자 정의 채널을 참조하십시오.","title":"Register Clients With the Web UI","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-webui","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-webui.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see 지원되는 클라이언트 및 기능. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see 등록 방법. Procedure: Configure a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on Your Client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.MLM.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.MLM.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare Software Channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard.

Automated update of clients is benefitial when: update of a large number of clients is wanted the workflow should not be re-done every execution a dedicated maintenance window exists. Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent and supportable state. Before you start, you should have a number of clients onboarded. It may make sense to have them sorted into groups you want to update together. In this workflow we use a system group named infra-services. To update a client two steps are required. A third step is optional but highly recommended to finalize the update process. Procedure 1: Creating a Recurring Action to Update Salt Itself As an example, we create the action to update Salt itself as a recurring action for all systems in the organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like update-salt. Select a schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:00 am . Assign the update-salt state by selecting the checkbox. Click Save Changes to save the action. You can edit the execution order of the states if needed. Click Confirm to confirm the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 2: Creating a Recurring Action to Apply All Available Updates to the Systems As an example we create the action to apply all updates as a recurring action for a system group called infra-services. In the Uyuni Web UI go to Systems System Groups and click on infra-services. Now go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like full-system-update. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:30 am . Keep enough time between this action and the update-salt action. The update-salt actions must be finished on all systems before this action should be executed. Assign the states util.syncall, certs, channels and uptodate by selecting the checkboxes. To perform a reboot afterwards you can also add reboot or rebootifneeded. Save the action by clicking Save Changes. You can edit the execution order of the states. The order should be util.syncall, certs, channels, uptodate and finally reboot or rebootifneeded if chosen. Click Confirm to store the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 4: Creating a Recurring Action to Run a Highstate After the Update As an example, we create the action to apply the highstate for the same group which was fully updated before. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click infra-services. Go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Highstate and enter a Schedule Name like highstate. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 10:30 am . Again, keep enough time between this action and the full-system-update action. Click Create Schedule to save the action. The uptodate state applies critical patches to the update components. On SUSE-based systems, the state executes the command: zypper --non-interactive patch --updatestack-only And then, the state also updates Salt. On all the other systems, not based on SUSE, the state only updates Salt. The state runs the package manager, such as dnf, yum, apt, or zypper based on what is available on the client operating system to update the rest of the packages. The state lists all of the upgradable packages, based on the synchronized package repositories in Uyuni. The state upgrades the packages to their latest available version by using the client’s package manager. The executed command depends on the operating system of the client: For Debian-based clients, such as Debian or Ubuntu, the action executes apt dist-upgrade -q -y $PACKAGES. For RPM-based clients that are not SUSE, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Liberty Linux, the action executes yum --quiet -y update $PACKAGES or dnf --quiet -y upgrade $PACKAGES (depending on the package manager the client is using). For non-transactional SUSE clients, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, the action executes zypper --non-interactive --auto-agree-with-licenses update $PACKAGES. For transactional SUSE clients, the action executes the same in a transactional shell. Uyuni provides the reboot and rebootifneeded actions. Use one of the actions if you want your client to reboot after the package upgrade. + rebootifneeded Reboot detection is specific to the client operating system. For Debian or Ubuntu, see https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#signaling-that-a-reboot-is-required. For non-transactional SUSE clients, Uyuni reboots the client when zypper -x list-patches indicates that the patches require a reboot. For transactional SUSE clients, Uyuni reboots the client if there is a pending transaction. For the Red Hat-based clients, Uyuni reboots the client if dnf -q needs-restarting -r indicates that a reboot is required. + For more information, see the reboot_info.py module: https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/blob/master/susemanager-utils/susemanager-sls/src/modules/reboot_info.py For more information about recurring actions, see Recurring Actions.

CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server deployed, and accessible using the Web UI.

In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade <listentry> <ask_on_error config:type=\"boolean\">true</ask_on_error> #if $channel_prefix != \"\" <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #else <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #end if <name>$channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool</name> <product>sle-manager-tools</product> </listentry> Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration. Procedure: Migrating Clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. + image::wf-inplaceMigration-06.png[scaledwidth=80%] + image::wf-inplaceMigration-07.png[scaledwidth=80%] Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console.","title":"In-place Upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This change requires some manual steps when upgrading from earlier versions to 5.1. Users performing a new product synchronization will not notice any differences. However, for products synchronized before the upgrade, you must synchronize the new client tools channels after migration. Channels previously named SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ (with labels such as manager-tools-*), used in SUSE Manager 4.3 or 5.0, are no longer available in version 5.1. Although these old channels remain assigned to existing clients after migration, their corresponding repositories have been removed. To ensure continued updates for client tools, you must: Mirror the new SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels for the relevant products and assign them to the appropriate clients. Update any CLM projects, activation keys, or AutoYaST profiles that reference the old client tools channels to use the new ones. This workflow demonstrates how to automate the synchronization of the new client tools channels and switch existing entities to use them via the XML-RPC API. The process involves two main steps: Synchronize the new client tools channels. Update entities such as activation keys and CLM projects to use the new channels. This workflow is intended for administrators managing Uyuni 5.1. It helps automate the process of syncing new channels and updating activation keys and CLM projects, including project promotion, through the API, eliminating the need for manual operations in the Web UI. By following this workflow, you can create a Python script that: Synchronizes the new client tools channels. Lists all available activations keys/ CLM projects. Removes old client tools channels and attaches the new ones. Builds and promotes project environments. After completing this workflow, new client tools will be synced and activation key and CLM projects will be fully switched to the new client tools channels. Before you start, ensure that: You have administrator access to Uyuni. A working Python environment is available. This workflow is divided into two major steps: Synchronizing the new client tools channels. Updating CLM projects and activation keys to use these new channels. The first step ensures that all new client tools channels are synchronized for already installed base products. This is achieved by listing all installed products via the XML-RPC API and identifying the matching client tools extensions. The synchronization logic consists of two main operations: List all installed products and their associated extensions. Add the client tools channels (SLE-M-T family) that are not yet synchronized. These operations use the following XML-RPC methods: sync.content.listProducts(key) - Returns a list of all available products and their extensions. sync.content.addChannel(key, channelLabel, '') - adds a specific channel for synchronization. def find_extensions_of_synced_products(client, key): \"\"\"Retrieve all extensions of installed products.\"\"\" all_extensions = [] products = client.sync.content.listProducts(key) for product in products: if product.get('status', '').lower() == 'installed': extensions = product.get('extensions', []) all_extensions.extend(extensions) return all_extensions def add_client_tools_channels(client, key, extensions, dry_run): \"\"\"Add all new client tools channels that are not yet synced.\"\"\" for ext in extensions: if \"Client Tools\" in ext.get('friendly_name', ''): for ch in ext.get('channels', []): if ch.get('family') == 'SLE-M-T' and not ch.get('optional', False): if ch.get('status', '').lower() == 'installed': continue label = ch.get('label') client.sync.content.addChannel(key, label, '') Detect installed products using client.sync.content.listProducts(key). Iterate through product extensions to locate those containing “Client Tools” in their friendly_name. For each client tools extension: Check if the channel’s family equals SLE-M-T. Skip if the channel is already installed (status = installed). Otherwise, add the channel using client.sync.content.addChannel(key, label, ''). This will ensure that all required client tools channels are added automatically before updating CLM projects or activation keys in Step 2. Once the channels have been added, they will be picked up by the next scheduled repository synchronization job. If you want to trigger an immediate synchronization, you can schedule the Single Run Schedule task from the mgr-sync-refresh-bunch task family. This forces the server to refresh and synchronize all newly added channels right away. Based on this workflow, a helper utility script named sync_client_tools has been created in the Uyuni contrib repository that one can use. Once the new client tools channels are synchronized, the next step is to update your Content Lifecycle Management projects and activation keys so that they reference the new channels instead of the old ones. This ensures that clients continue receiving updates from the correct repositories. This step consists of the following main tasks: Identify CLM projects that still reference the old client tools channels. Detach old (manager-tools) channels and attach the new (managertools) channels. Rebuild and promote the CLM project environments in the correct order. Update related activation keys to reference the new channels. List all projects and select the one to process. For initial testing, use a single project such as clm-project-example: projects = client.contentmanagement.listProjects(key) for p in projects: if p['label'] == 'clm-project-example': # Adjust to process all projects if needed project_label = p['label'] Testing with a single project helps prevent large-scale accidental updates. Retrieve project sources and identify both old (manager-tools) and new (managertools) client tools channels: sources = client.contentmanagement.listProjectSources(key, project_label) old_tools = [s['channelLabel'] for s in sources if 'manager-tools' in s.get('channelLabel', '').lower()] new_tools = [s['channelLabel'] for s in sources if 'managertools' in s.get('channelLabel', '').lower()] These lists will be used to detach outdated channels and attach the new ones. For each old channel detected, call the detachSource endpoint: if old_tools: for old in old_tools: client.contentmanagement.detachSource(key, project_label, 'software', old) It is strongly recommended to run in dry-run mode first to validate which channels would be removed. If the new client tools channels are not already attached, identify the matching base channel, list its child channels, and attach those with managertools in the label : if not new_tools: source_labels = [s.get('channelLabel', '') for s in sources] base_channel_label = next((lbl for lbl in source_labels if lbl in base_channels), None) if base_channel_label: children = client.channel.software.listChildren(key, base_channel_label) managertools_labels = [s['label'] for s in children if 'managertools' in s.get('label', '').lower()] if managertools_labels: for label in managertools_labels: client.contentmanagement.attachSource(key, project_label, 'software', label) Ensure the new client tools channels are already mirrored and synchronized before attachment. Once sources are updated, list the project environments in sequence: all_envs = client.contentmanagement.listProjectEnvironments(key, project_label) The returned list is ordered, and promotions should follow that order. Build the first environment, then promote subsequent ones with short pauses between each to ensure completion. if not all_envs: return first_env_label = all_envs[0]['label'] for i, env in enumerate(all_envs): env_label = env['label'] is_first_env = (env_label == first_env_label) if is_first_env: description = \"Build for new client tools channels.\" client.contentmanagement.buildProject(key, project_label, description) else: client.contentmanagement.promoteProject(key, project_label, env_label) if not dry_run and i < len(all_envs) - 1: log(\"Waiting 30 seconds before next promotion...\") time.sleep(30) After CLM projects are updated, ensure that any activation keys referencing old client tools channels are switched to the new channels as well. You can use the following API calls activationkey.listActivationKeys(key) activationkey.removeChildChannels(key, key_label, channels) activationkey.addChildChannels(key, key_label, channels) to automate this process. Based on this workflow, a helper utility script named migrate_to_new_client_tools has been created in the Uyuni contrib repository to simplify and automate the migration process. It can significantly reduce manual effort, but it should be used with caution. Always test the script in dry-run mode and on a single entity first (for example, one CLM project or one activation key) before running it across all projects. The provided script example based on this workflow use some helper functions, mainly the following: log(message) – Prints or logs messages during execution. dry_run_log(message) – Logs intended actions when running in dry-run mode, without performing real API calls. wait_for_completion(client, key, project_label, env_label) – Waits for build or promotion tasks to complete, ensuring that the process finishes successfully before proceeding. These helper functions are not part of the XML-RPC API but are necessary for structured output, error handling, and safe automation. Without them, the script would execute API calls without clear feedback or control flow, which could lead to incomplete or unsafe project promotions. It is recommend to run your script in dry-run mode first to review the planned changes and test with a single project before applying it to all.","title":"Switch to new client tools channels","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-switch-to-new-client-tools-channels","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-switch-to-new-client-tools-channels.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This document describes how to connect existing PAYG instance to Uyuni server, and gives basic information about credentials collection from the instance. The goal of this connection is to extract authentication data so the Uyuni Server can connect to a cloud RMT host. Then the Uyuni Server has access to products on the RMT host that are not already available with the SCC organization credentials. Before using PAYG feature make sure that: 원하는 리포지토리에 액세스할 수 있도록 올바른 SUSE 제품 이미지(예: SLES, SLES for SAP 또는 SLE HPC)에서 PAYG 인스턴스가 시작됩니다. Uyuni 서버는 직접 또는 배스천을 통해 PAYG 인스턴스(이상적으로는 동일한 영역에 위치)에 연결됩니다. A basic SCC account is required. Enter your valid SCC credentials in Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials. This account is required for accessing the Uyuni client tools for boostrapping regardless of PAYG instances. If you bootstrap the PAYG instance to SUSE Manager, SUSE Manager will disable its PAYG repositories then add repositories from where it mirrored the data from the RMT server. The final result will be PAYG instances acquiring the same repositories from the RMT servers but through the SUSE Manager server itself. Of course repositories can still be setup primarily from SCC.

One of SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 is the operating system of the container host. In the following, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server as the installed host operating system is explicitly mentioned only if it matters. Otherwise we either write SL Micro or just host operating system. The container host with SL Micro as operating system requires as free disk space: 기본 설치 시 최소 100GB 리포지토리 데이터용 공간 최소 130GB Depending on the amount of selected software, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server as operating system can require considerably more disk space. By default the Uyuni Server container stores mirrored repository (packages or products), database, and other data in subdirectories of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/ directory. Repository synchronization fails if this directory runs out of disk space. Estimate how much space the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/ directory requires based on the number and kind of clients and repositories you plan to mirror. 파일 시스템 및 파티셔닝 세부 정보에 대한 자세한 내용은 영구 스토리지 및 권한 및 이 가이드의 설치 및 배포 섹션에 있는 세부 설치 지침을 참조하십시오.

SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For more information about swap space, see Swap space. 8 to 12 GB The images by default have a 40 GB / partition. The cloud image of SL Micro 6.1 has just a 5 GB / partition. Both work flawlessly with Uyuni. As long as external storage is mounted to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes, Uyuni does not need or use storage on the / partition, but leaves that to the management of the container host itself. Uyuni 성능은 하드웨어 리소스, 네트워크 대역폭, 클라이언트와 서버 간 대기 시간 등에 따라 달라집니다. 사용 중인 환경과 다양한 배포에 따라 적절한 수의 프록시가 배치된 Uyuni 서버의 최적 성능을 달성하려면 단일 서버당 10,000개의 클라이언트를 초과하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 클라이언트가 10,000개를 초과하는 경우 허브 설정으로 이동하여 컨설팅을 포함하는 것이 매우 권장됩니다. 미세 조정 및 적절한 수의 프록시가 포함된 경우에도 클라이언트의 수가 그렇게 많으면 성능 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 대규모 클라이언트 관리에 대한 자세한 내용은 Multiple Servers with Hub to Manage Large Scale Deployments에서 확인할 수 있습니다. One of SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 is the operating system of the container host.

SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For more information about swap space, see Swap space. 4 to 8 GB By default the Uyuni Proxy container caches packages in the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory. If there is not enough space available, the proxy will remove old, unused packages and replace them with newer packages. 이 동작의 결과: The larger /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory is on the proxy, the less traffic will be between the proxy and the Uyuni Server. By making the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory on the proxy the same size as /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk/ on the Uyuni Server, you avoid a large amount of traffic after the first synchronization. The /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/uyuni-proxy-squid-cache/ directory can be small on the Uyuni Server compared to the proxy. For a guide to size estimation, see the 서버 요구사항 section. In general, SUSE recommends to adjust the value for the cache directory to about 80 % of available free space. The cache_dir value is set when generating proxy configuration on the server. You cannot set the option directly in squid.conf. Workloads differ from system to system. Systems with heavy or unpredictable workloads can benefit from additional swap space, regardless of total RAM. It is recommended to place swap on the fastest available storage (for example, SSD). SUSE recommends using a swap file instead of a swap partition. For size recommendations, see the tables above. The following shell command snippet creates a 8GiB swap file. A swap file on BtrFS filesystem prevent creating of a snapshot of that volume. /var in the following example is already excluded from the snapper snapshots, so it is safe to use /var/swap. ## setup swapfile at /var/swap # run following as a root user # allocate 8GiB for swap file fallocate -l 8G /var/swap # ensure CoW is disabled for the swap file chattr +C /var/swap # allow only root access chmod 600 /var/swap # make swap file based on allocated file mkswap /var/swap # activate swap use for the running system swapon /var/swap # activate swap during the next boots echo \"/var/swap swap swap defaults 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab PostgreSQL 데이터베이스만 지원됩니다. 원격 PostgreSQL 데이터베이스 또는 원격 파일 시스템(예: NFS)을 PostgreSQL 데이터베이스와 함께 사용하는 기능은 지원되지 않습니다. 즉, PostgreSQL은 Uyuni에 대해 사용 가능한 가장 빠른 저장소 장치에 있어야 합니다. 잠재적인 성능 문제로 인해 PostgreSQL 데이터베이스를 Uyuni에서 원격으로 실행하는 것은 일반적으로 권장하지 않습니다. 이러한 환경은 많은 경우에 사용할 수 있고 안정적이지만, 문제가 발생하면 데이터가 손실될 위험이 항상 있습니다. 컨테이너를 배포할 때 기본적으로 영구 볼륨이 생성됩니다. However, it is recommended that the volumes are stored on one or more separate storage devices. Such a setup helps avoid data loss in production environments. This can be done after container deployment. Storage devices best should be set up after first deploying the container. For more details, see Persistent Container Volumes. We recommend you use XFS as the filesystem type for all volumes. The size of the disk for repositories storage is dependent on the number of distributions and channels you intend to manage with Uyuni. See the tables in this section for guides to estimate the size required. Do not use NFS for Cobbler or PostgreSQL storage, neither NFS on SELinux environments. These scenarios are not supported. Uyuni 서버에서 이 명령을 사용하여 사용할 수 있는 모든 스토리지 장치를 찾습니다. hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"장치 파일:\" lsblk 명령을 사용하여 각 장치의 이름 및 크기를 확인합니다. Use the mgr-storage-server command with the device names to set up the external disks as the locations for the storage and, optionally on a disk of its own, for the database: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] 예: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 외부 저장소 볼륨은 /manager_storage 및 /pgsql_storage에 마운트된 XFS 파티션으로 설정됩니다. 이 명령은 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes에 영구 스토리지 볼륨을 생성합니다. 자세한 내용은 Persistent Container Volumes에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 채널 데이터 및 데이터베이스 모두에서 동일한 스토리지 장치를 사용할 수 있습니다. 채널 리포지토리가 증가하여 스토리지가 가득 차 데이터베이스 무결성이 손상될 수 있으므로 이 방법은 권장되지 않습니다. 별도의 스토리지 장치를 사용하면 성능도 향상할 수 있습니다. 1개의 스토리지 장치를 사용하려면 단일 장치 이름 파라미터와 함께 mgr-storage-server를 실행합니다. If you are installing a proxy, the mgr-storage-proxy command takes only one device name parameter and will set up the external storage location as the Squid cache. For all kind of virtual machines (VM), LVM is generally not needed and not recommended. The disk setup is virtual and separate disks for volumes are possible and recommended. For other deployments, separate disks for volumes are also recommended. On the container host of the Uyuni Server, the mgr-storage-server command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes. Optionally, if a second device name is specified, mgr-storage-server moves the content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql database directory to a second separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql. Similarly, on the container host of the Uyuni Proxy, the mgr-storage-proxy command moves the complete content of the /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes directory to a separate disk and remounts it to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes.","title":"하드웨어 요구사항","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 서버 요구사항","hash":"server-hardware-requirements","id":1},{"text":"2. 프록시 요구사항","hash":"proxy-hardware-requirements","id":2},{"text":"3.

IP forwarding will be enabled by containerized installation. This means Uyuni Server and Proxies will behave as a router. This behavior is done by podman directly. Podman containers do not run if IP forwarding is disabled. Consider achieving network isolation of the Uyuni environment according to your policies. For more information, see https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020166. Uyuni 서버는 FQDN이 올바르게 확인되어야 합니다. FQDN을 확인할 수 없는 경우 여러 다른 구성 요소에서 심각한 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 호스트 이름 및 DNS 구성에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-network.html#sec-network-yast-change-host에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 클라이언트가 Uyuni 도메인 이름을 올바르게 확인하도록 하려면, 서버 및 클라이언트 머신 모두 작동하는 DNS 서버에 연결되어야 합니다. 또한, 역방향 조회도 올바르게 구성되었는지 확인해야 합니다. DNS 서버 설정에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-dns.html에서 확인할 수 있습니다. When the Uyuni is installed using mgradm install podman or mgrpxy install podman, it sets up Podman which enables IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding. This is needed for communication from the outside of the container. However, if your system previously had /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/accept_ra set to 1, it will stop using router advertisements. As a result, the routes are no longer obtained via router advertisements and the default IPv6 route is missing. To recover correct functioning of the IPv6 routing, follow the procedure: Procedure: Reenabling router advertisements Create a file in /etc/sysctl.d, for example 99-ipv6-ras.conf. Add the following parameter and value to the file: net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_ra = 2 재부팅합니다. Some environments enforce internet access through a HTTP or HTTPS proxy. This could be a Squid server or similar. To allow the Uyuni Server internet access in such configuration, you need to configure the following. Procedure: Configuring HTTP or HTTPS OSI level 7 proxy For operating system internet access, modify /etc/sysconfig/proxy according to your needs: PROXY_ENABLED=\"no\" HTTP_PROXY=\"\" HTTPS_PROXY=\"\" NO_PROXY=\"localhost, 127.0.0.1\" For Podman container internet access, modify /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service.d/custom.conf according to your needs. For example, set: [Service] Environment=TZ=Europe/Berlin Environment=\"PODMAN_EXTRA_ARGS=\" Environment=\"https_proxy=user:password@http://192.168.10.1:3128\" For Java application internet access, modify /etc/rhn/rhn.conf according to your needs. On the container host, execute mgrctl term to open a command line inside the server container: Modify /etc/rhn/rhn.conf according to your needs. For example, set: # Use proxy FQDN, or FQDN:port server.satellite.http_proxy = server.satellite.http_proxy_username = server.satellite.http_proxy_password = # no_proxy is a comma seperated list server.satellite.no_proxy = On the container host, restart the server to enforce the new configuration: systemctl restart uyuni-server.service If you are on an internal network and do not have access to SUSE Customer Center, you can use an Air-gapped Deployment. In a production environment, the Uyuni Server and clients should always use a firewall. For a comprehensive list of the required ports, see 필수 네트워크 포트. 이 섹션에서는 Uyuni에서의 다양한 통신을 위해 사용되는 전체 포트 목록이 제공됩니다. 이러한 모든 포트를 열 필요는 없습니다. 사용 중인 서비스에 필요한 포트만 열면 됩니다. 무단 액세스로부터 서버를 보호하려면 Uyuni 서버에서 외부 인바운드 포트를 열어 방화벽을 구성해야 합니다. 이러한 포트를 열면 외부 네트워크 트래픽이 Uyuni 서버에 액세스할 수 있습니다.

Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure에서 이러한 지침을 테스트했지만 약간의 차이는 있지만 다른 공급자에서도 작동해야 합니다. 시작하기 전 고려해야 할 사항은 다음과 같습니다. Uyuni 설정 절차는 정방향 확인 된 역방향 DNS 조회를 수행합니다. 설정 절차를 완료하고 Uyuni이 예상대로 작동하려면 이 작업이 성공해야 합니다. Uyuni를 설정하기 전에 호스트 이름 및 IP 구성을 수행하는 것이 중요합니다. Uyuni 서버 및 프록시 인스턴스는 DNS 항목을 관리할 수 있는 네트워크 구성에서 실행해야 하지만 인터넷에서 전체적으로 액세스할 수 없습니다. 이 네트워크 구성에서는 DNS 확인이 제공되어야 합니다. hostname -f에서 FQDN(정규화된 도메인 이름)을 반환해야 합니다. DNS 확인은 클라이언트 연결에도 중요합니다. DNS는 선택한 클라우드 프레임워크와 독립적입니다. 자세한 지침은 클라우드 공급자의 설명서를 참조하십시오. 외부 가상 디스크에서 소프트웨어 리포지토리, 서버 데이터베이스 및 프록시 squid 캐시를 찾는 것이 좋습니다. 이를 수행하면 인스턴스가 예기치 않게 종료되는 경우 데이터 손실을 방지할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에는 외부 가상 디스크를 설정하기 위한 지침이 포함되어 있습니다. 공용 클라우드에서 Uyuni를 사용하는 경우 제한 네트워크를 사용해야 합니다. 방화벽이 올바르게 설정된 VPC 개인 서브넷을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 지정된 IP 범위의 시스템만 인스턴스에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 퍼블릭 클라우드에서 Uyuni을 실행하면 강력한 보안 조치를 구현할 수 있습니다. 인스턴스에 대한 액세스 제한, 필터링, 모니터링 및 감사 기능은 필수 기능입니다. SUSE는 적절한 경계 보안이 부족한 전역 액세스 Uyuni 인스턴스를 사용하지 않을 것을 강력하게 권장됩니다. Uyuni Web UI에 액세스하려면, 네트워크 액세스 제어를 구성할 때 HTTPS를 허용하십시오. 이렇게 하면 Uyuni Web UI에 액세스할 수 있습니다. EC2 및 Azure에서 새 보안 그룹을 만들고 HTTPS에 대한 인바운드 및 아웃바운드 규칙을 추가합니다. GCE에서 방화벽 섹션 아래의 HTTPS 트래픽 허용 상자를 선택합니다. Uyuni용 리포지토리와 데이터베이스를 루트 볼륨과 별도의 스토리지 장치에 저장하는 것이 좋습니다. 이렇게 하면 데이터 손실을 방지하고 성능을 향상하는 데 도움이 됩니다. Uyuni 컨테이너는 기본 스토리지 위치를 사용합니다. 이러한 위치는 사용자 정의 스토리지를 배포하기 전에 구성해야 합니다. 자세한 내용은 영구 컨테이너 볼륨에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 공용 클라우드 설치에는 논리적 볼륨 관리(LVM)를 사용하지 않아야 합니다. 리포지토리 저장소를 위한 디스크 크기는 Uyuni로 관리할 배포 및 채널 수에 따라 다릅니다. 가상 디스크를 연결하면 인스턴스에 Unix 장치 노드로 표시됩니다. 장치 노드의 이름은 공급자 및 선택한 인스턴스 유형에 따라 다릅니다. Uyuni 서버의 루트 볼륨이 100GB 이상인지 확인합니다. 500GB 이상의 추가 저장소 디스크를 추가하고 가능하면 SSD 저장소를 선택하십시오. Uyuni 서버의 클라우드 이미지는 인스턴스가 시작될 때 스크립트를 사용하여 별도의 볼륨을 할당합니다. 인스턴스를 시작할 때 Uyuni 서버에 로그인하고 이 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 모든 저장소 장치를 찾을 수 있습니다. hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"장치 파일:\" 선택해야 할 장치가 확실하지 않은 경우 lsblk 명령을 사용하여 각 장치의 이름과 크기를 확인하십시오. 찾고 있는 가상 디스크의 크기와 일치하는 이름을 선택하십시오. mgr-storage-server 명령어로 외부 디스크를 설정할 수 있습니다. 그러면 /manager_storage에 마운트된 XFS 파티션이 생성되고 이를 데이터베이스 및 리포지토리의 위치로 사용합니다. /usr/bin/mgr-storage-server <devicename>","title":"공용 클라우드 요구사항","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"pubcloud-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/pubcloud-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 네트워크 요구사항","hash":"_네트워크_요구사항","id":1},{"text":"2. 스토리지 볼륨 준비","hash":"_스토리지_볼륨_준비","id":2}]},"180":{"id":180,"text":"다음 테이블은 최소 서버 및 프록시 요구사항을 지정합니다.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

There are two tools for synchronizing clients to the server. For clients that are connected to the SUSE Customer Center, use mgr-sync. For all other clients, use spacewalk-repo-sync. The primary use of mgr-sync is to connect to the SUSE Customer Center, retrieve product and package information, and prepare channels for synchronization with the Uyuni Server. 이 도구는 SUSE 지원 구독과 함께 사용하도록 설계되었으며, openSUSE, CentOS 및 Ubuntu 등 오픈 소스 배포에는 필요하지 않습니다. mgr-sync에서 사용할 수 있는 명령과 인수는 이 테이블에서 확인할 수 있습니다. mgr-sync 명령에 다음 구문을 사용합니다. mgr-sync [-h] [--version] [-v] [-s] [-d {1,2,3}] {list,add,refresh,delete} Table 1. mgr-sync 명령 Command Description Example Use list List channels, organization credentials, or products mgr-sync list channels add Add channels, organization credentials, or products mgr-sync add channel <channel_name> refresh Refresh the local copy of products, channels, and subscriptions mgr-sync refresh delete Delete existing SCC organization credentials from the local system mgr-sync delete credentials sync Synchronize specified channel or ask for it when left blank mgr-sync sync channel <channel_name> 명령과 관련된 전체 옵션 목록을 확인하려면 다음 명령을 사용합니다. mgr-sync <command> --help Table 2. mgr-sync 선택 사항 인수 옵션 약식 옵션 설명 예시 사용 help h 명령 사용법 및 옵션 표시 mgr-sync --help version N/A 현재 설치된 mgr-sync 버전 표시 mgr-sync --version verbose v 자세한 출력 제공 mgr-sync --verbose refresh store-credentials s 자격 증명을 로컬 숨김 파일에 저장 mgr-sync --store-credentials debug d 추가 디버깅 정보 기록. 1, 2, 3의 수준 필요. 3은 가장 많은 양의 디버깅 정보를 제공 mgr-sync -d 3 refresh no-sync N/A 동기화를 시작하지 않고 제품 또는 채널을 추가하려면 add 명령과 함께 사용 mgr-sync --no-sync add <channel_name> 다음은 mgr-sync에 대한 로그의 위치입니다. /var/log/rhn/mgr-sync.log /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_api.log The spacewalk-repo-sync tool synchronizes software repositories into Uyuni channels.

Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configures DHCP for PXE booting. Without the formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. For more information how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server, see DHCPd Formula. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using the newest Uyuni Server. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Procedure Create the following three system groups. For guidelines on how to create the groups, see 시스템 그룹. TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 The first group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. The second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. The third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. This converts the branch group to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name and Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot Group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy, fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. For explanation of possible configurations, see Terminal Names. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server, where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is built and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Procedure: Deploying with containerized workflow Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Procedure: Deploying with non-ontainerized workflow Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example, when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with which parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The hardware type group (i.e. HWTYPE group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the Saltboot formula. This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. Procedure: Dual group image deployment Build new image. Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Controlling image versions","hash":"_controlling_image_versions","id":2}]},"199":{"id":199,"text":"Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see Prometheus 및 Grafana를 사용한 모니터링. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created. The Saltboot process involves the Uyuni Server, a terminal running the Saltboot initrd, and the branch server providing the Saltboot services to the terminal. For a detailed diagram explaining how the Saltboot boot process works, see Terminal Boot Process (Saltboot Diagram).","title":"Components","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-components","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-components.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be <NAME>-<VERSION> and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar in the database. Performance tuning is possible with the -B <VALUE> option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server.

This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see [retail.deployterminals.auto.once]. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, which is preserved in etc-salt volume. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept At the command prompt of the Uyuni container host, as root, enter the server container: mgrctl term Inside the container, execute the following steps: In directory /etc/salt/master.d/, create file autosign_grains.conf and specify autosign_grains_dir: echo \"autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains\" \\ > /etc/salt/master.d/autosign_grains.conf Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot (replace <AUTOSIGN_KEY> with the key: mkdir /etc/salt/autosign_grains echo \"<AUTOSIGN_KEY>\" > /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key For multiple keys, put each one on a new line.

Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY> # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY> # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the <packages type=\"image\"> element, add: <archive name=\"autosign.tgz\" bootinclude=\"true\"/> Save the file and rebuild the image. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot Configure the PXE formula to specify these kernel parameters during booting: SALT_AUTOSIGN_GRAINS=autosign_key:<AUTOSIGN_KEY> PXE boot the Salt client. The formula creates the ./etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains-onetime.conf configuration file and passes it to initrd.","title":"Deploy Terminals and Auto-Accept Keys","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-auto","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-auto.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create <usb image name> <size in MB> Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if=<usb image name> of=<path to usb device> When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. 이미지를 빌드합니다. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt <terminal_salt_name> state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Terminals can be either x86-64 or arm64 architecture. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Manual synchronization of images is needed only when using non-containerized Uyuni for Retail 4.3 branch server. Image synchronization downloads system and boot images from the Uyuni Server to the Uyuni for Retail branch server. This may involve updating default boot image for not yet registered terminals. Default boot image can be set in the Image Synchronize formula. If default boot image is not set, boot image with highest version is used as default boot image. This behaviour can be disabled by unchecking Use Latest Boot Image checkbox in the Image Synchronize formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_salt_id> state.apply image-sync When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. Create the top.sls file with content: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Create the saltboot_proto.sls file with content: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp saltboot_proto.sls server:/srv/pillar/ Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server.

All formulas must be accurately configured for your Uyuni for Retail installation to function correctly. Branch servers are configured using formulas. Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server. The following formulas can be used for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3 with Uyuni 5.0: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula In addition, Bind and DHCPd formulas can be used, but not on the branch server because SLE Micro does not have Bind and DHCPd in the repositories. Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services.

You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 시스템 그룹에 대한 자세한 내용은 시스템 그룹에서 확인할 수 있습니다. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see Prometheus 및 Grafana를 사용한 모니터링. In case you plan to use the branch server with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible 통합. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"<FQDN of branch server proxy>/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_minion_id> state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly.

These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. POS image templates and resulting images do not set a system user password. You will not be able to login as a system user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template without customization. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user password. You can use Salt to set up a system user password after the terminal has been deployed. After POS image is successfully built and inspected by Uyuni, you can validate that POS boot image was correctly registered by following procedure. Procedure Validate POS boot image On Uyuni command line execute following command: mgrctl exec cobbler distro list Your POS image should be listed with organization number before image name For every branch server choose branch id. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 시스템 그룹에 대한 자세한 내용은 시스템 그룹에서 확인할 수 있습니다. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. In case you plan to use the branch server container host as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see Prometheus 및 Grafana를 사용한 모니터링. In case you plan to use the branch server container host with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible 통합. Before configuring Saltboot group, make sure you already have at least one POS image available. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured using so called Saltboot Group. Saltboot groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name created in previous step, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula previously used in Uyuni for Retail setups. To connect Saltboot Group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Listing 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"<FQDN of branch server proxy>/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"grub/shim.efi\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } else { filename \"pxelinux.0\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Uyuni for Retail branch proxy uses different filename then previous non-containerized branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires instructions how to partitioning terminal harddisk and what image to deploy. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types and partitioning, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Uyuni for Retail 2025.10 no longer need manual image synchronization, all images are available to all clients automatically. This may not be always desired, for example to allow images gradual deployments across all branches. For a way how to limit image deployment, see Best practices.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Mass configuration tool was not yet adapted for containerized saltboot workflow. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. We recommend you have a fast network connection between the branch server and its terminals. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch servers can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. Uyuni for Retail Branch Servers are implemented as enhanced Uyuni Proxies. For technical background information on Uyuni Proxies, see 컨테이너화된 Uyuni 프록시 설정. You can use branch servers in different network configurations, depending on your installation requirements.

This is useful if the connection between the branch server and the Uyuni Server is unstable or has low bandwidth. This feature uses caching to perform updates. If the Uyuni Server is offline, and a terminal is rebooted, it will fall back to a previously installed image. This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi). You can adjust the timeout value by changing the SALT_TIMEOUT kernel parameter. The parameter is measured in seconds, and defaults to 60. SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula. When the service partition is set up on the terminal, a POS image can be downloaded in advance by applying the saltboot.cache_image state: salt $TERMINALID state.apply saltboot.cache_image This can be done regularly to ensure that terminals always have an uptodate POS image downloaded.

Occasionally, however, it is needed to force Saltboot to redeploy an image or repartition disk, even when automation would not do so. For these situations, Saltboot offers three ways to force redeployment or repartitioning: Force Saltboot redeployment using Salt grains Force Saltboot redeployment using custom info values Force Saltboot redeployment using Saltboot API call Force Saltboot redeployment by custom pillar Repartitioning of a terminal removes all data stored on the terminal hard disk, including any persistent partitions. Saltboot redeployment grains have no side effects, and do not require any further configuration. The limitation is that terminal must be accessible by salt.

Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 예: B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. Terminal names are derived from the network interface hardware address (MAC) and use this format: BranchID.MAC-UniqueID 예: B0002.52:54:00:62:18:6f-cb83 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The MAC is colon delimited hardware address of the network interface card used for booting of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the non-containerized branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet <terminal_MAC_address> OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: <IP_Address> hwAddress: <MAC_Address> hwtype: <HWTYPE_Group_name_without_HWTYPE:_prefix> Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. For more information about using YAML configuration files, see Mass Configuration.","title":"Terminal Names","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-terminal-names","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-terminal-names.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For proxy installation procedures, see 컨테이너화된 Uyuni 프록시 설정. Then continue with the following sections. Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. 이 절차에 필요한 제품은 다음과 같습니다. Table 1. openSUSE 채널 - CLI OS Version openSUSE Leap 15.4 Base Channel opensuse_leap15_4 Client Channel opensuse_leap15_4-uyuni-client Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-updates Non-OSS Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss Non-OSS Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-non-oss-updates Backports Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-backports-updates SLE Updates Channel opensuse_leap15_4-sle-updates Procedure: Adding Software Channels at the Command Prompt With the spacewalk-common-channels command you can add the appropriate channels. At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, execute the following command: mgrctl exec -- spacewalk-common-channels \\ <base_channel_name> \\ <child_channel_name_1> \\ <child_channel_name_2> \\ ... <child_channel_name_n> Synchronize the channels: mgrctl exec -- mgr-sync refresh --refresh-channels 절차: 동기화 진행 상태 확인 Uyuni Web UI에서 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동한 다음, 리포지토리에 연결된 채널을 클릭합니다. 리포지토리 탭으로 이동한 다음, 동기화를 클릭하고 동기화 상태를 확인합니다. 절차: 명령 프롬프트에서 동기화 진행 상태 확인 Uyuni 서버의 명령 프롬프트에서 루트 권한으로 다음과 같이 tail 명령을 사용해 동기화 로그 파일을 확인합니다. tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE 채널은 규모가 매우 클 수 있습니다. 때로 동기화에 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. 프로시저: 클라이언트의 GPG 키 신뢰 On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key If you are bootstrapping clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) 활성화 키 만들기에 대한 자세한 내용은 활성화 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels 클라이언트 등록에 대한 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 참조하십시오. A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see 컨테이너화된 Uyuni 프록시 설정. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types. Configure the proxy to become a branch server. On the Uyuni for Retail Server, for example, run: retail_branch_init <branch_server_minion_id> --dedicated-nic eth1 \\ --branch-ip 192.168.7.5 \\ --netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ --dyn-range 192.168.7.100 192.168.7.200 \\ --server-domain branch.example.org \\ --branch-prefix uyuni For additional options, use the [command]``retail_branch_init --help`` command.","title":"Retail Uyuni Branch Server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-uyuni-branchserver","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-uyuni-branchserver.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 소프트웨어 채널 추가","hash":"_소프트웨어_채널_추가","id":1},{"text":"2. 동기화 상태 확인","hash":"_동기화_상태_확인","id":2},{"text":"3. 클라이언트의 GPG 키 신뢰","hash":"_클라이언트의_gpg_키_신뢰","id":3},{"text":"4.

If you need to change the hostname of the Uyuni Server, you can do so using the mgradm server rename command. This command updates the settings in the PostgreSQL database and the internal structures of Uyuni. The command takes no mandatory parameter, but can take the new hostname if it is not the one from the container host. In case any SSL certificate needs to be generated to match the new hostname, the SSL CA password needs to be provided.

They are designed to configure storage for Uyuni Server and Proxy. The scripts take disk devices as arguments. mgr-storage-proxy requires a single argument for the storage disk device. mgr-storage-server requires a storage disk device and can optionally accept a second argument for a dedicated database disk device. While both normal and database storage can reside on the same disk, it is advisable to place the database on a dedicated, high-performance disk to ensure better performance and easier management. Both mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy perform standard storage setup operations: Validate the provided storage devices. Ensure that devices are empty and suitable for use. Create XFS filesystems on the specified devices. Mount the devices temporarily for data migration. Move the relevant storage directories to the new devices. Create entries in /etc/fstab so that the storage mounts automatically on boot. Remount the devices at their final locations. Table 1. Additional tool-specific behavior mgr-storage-server Optionally supports a separate device for database storage. Stops SUSE Manager services during migration, restarts them afterward. Moves Podman volumes directory /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes to the prepared storage, and optionally /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql to the prepared database storage. mgr-storage-proxy Focuses only on proxy storage (no database storage support). Stops and restarts the proxy service during migration. Moves podman volumes directory /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes to the prepared storage. Both tools automate standard Linux storage operations. There is no hidden or custom logic beyond what a Linux administrator would do manually. They do not create or manage LVM volumes. They do not configure RAID or complex storage topologies. They do not prevent you from managing storage using normal Linux tools after setup. They do not provide dynamic resizing or expansion capabilities — these must be handled using standard Linux storage tools. Once storage has been configured, you can safely manage it using standard Linux commands. Listing 1. Example 1: Extending storage if using LVM lvextend -L +10G /dev/your_vg/your_lv xfs_growfs /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes Example 2: Migrating to a larger disk Add and format the new disk. Mount it temporarily. Use rsync to copy data. Update /etc/fstab. Remount at the correct location. Always take a backup before making changes to your storage setup. Use these tools only during initial storage setup or when migrating to new storage where the tool is expected to handle data migration and update /etc/fstab. Do not rerun these scripts for resizing or expanding storage. Use standard Linux tools (e.g., lvextend, xfs_growfs) for such operations. mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy help automate the initial persistent storage setup for Uyuni components using standard Linux storage practices. They do not limit or interfere with standard storage management afterward. After setup, continue managing your storage using familiar Linux tools. A full database volume can cause significant issues with system operation. As disk usage notifications have not yet been adapted for containerized environments, users are encouraged to monitor the disk space used by Podman volumes themselves, either through tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, or any other preferred method. Pay particular attention to the var-pgsql volume, located under /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/.","title":"Understanding mgr-storage-server and mgr-storage-proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"storage-scripts","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-management/storage-scripts.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Central configuration management allows you to deploy configuration files to multiple systems, by using state channels. When you create a state channel, you can create or upload custom Salt states. For more information about custom states, see Custom Salt States. Click the name of the configuration channel to see the details page for that channel. If you click the number of files in the channel, you are taken to the List/Remove Files page of that channel. If you click the number of systems subscribed to the configuration channel, you are taken to the Configuration Channel Details Systems Subscribed Systems page for that channel. Overview The Overview page of the Configuration Channel Details page is divided into several panels: Channel Properties [Management] Edit the name, label, and description of the channel by clicking Edit Properties. Channel Information Provides status information for the contents of the channel. Configuration Actions Provides access to the most common configuration tasks. For Salt clients, there is a link to edit the init.sls file. This panel allows you to deploy, compare, and add and create files. Some action are only availalble if you have files created and clients assigned to configuration channels. List/Remove Files This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel. You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels. Check the box next to files you want to manipulate, then click the action button at the bottom. Add Files The Add Files page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to Upload, Import, or Create configuration files to be included in the channel. Upload File To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the Upload Configuration File button. The Filename/Path field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed. You can set the Ownership via the user name and group name and the Permissions of the file when it is deployed. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure SELinux contexts to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type). If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro. For more information on using macros, see reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros. Import Files To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import. Then click Import Configuration Files. A sandbox icon () indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox. Files in a system’s sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable. Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel. Create File Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link to be included in the configuration channel. Deploy Files This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel. Deploy all files by clicking the Deploy All Files button or check selected files and click the Deploy Selected Files button. Select to which systems the files should be applied.

The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy is generally reasonable for 500-1000 clients, but this is a recommendation, not a hard limit, and depends on available network bandwidth Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"424":{"id":424,"text":"When XMLRPC API is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"<HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL>\" HUB_USERNAME = \"<USERNAME>\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"<PASSWORD>\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2. Example Python Script for Relay Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"<HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL>\" HUB_USERNAME = \"<USERNAME>\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"<PASSWORD>\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # Authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate) client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds) # Perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Auto-Connect Authentication Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers. However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. Listing 3.

For example: mgradm install podman MLM.example.com --hubxmlrpc-replicas 1 For more information about deploying with mgradm, see installation-and-upgrade:container-deployment/mlm/server-deployment-mlm.adoc#deploy-mlm-server-mgradm. Database SSL certificates require reportdb and db as Subject Alternative Name. The same certificate can be used for server and database, as long the required alternative names are added. Procedure: Peripheral servers with self-generated certificates Preliminary Requirement: Hub server installation. For more information, see Hub server installation. On the container host of the hub server, enter the server container with: mgrctl term Inside the container, run rhn-ssl-tool for every peripheral server: rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" --set-country=\"COUNTRY\" \\ --set-state=\"STATE\" --set-city=\"CITY\" --set-org=\"ORGANIZATION\" \\ --set-org-unit=\"ORGANIZATION UNIT\" --set-email=\"name@example.com\" \\ --set-hostname=PERIPHAL-FQDN --set-cname=\"reportdb\" --set-cname=\"db\" For every peripheral server: From the hub server container, copy /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT, /root/ssl-build/<hostname>/server.crt and /root/ssl-build/<hostname>/server.key to the peripheral server host. On every peripheral server host, copy RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT to /etc/pki/trust/anchors/, and run update-ca-certificates. On every peripheral server host, deploy Uyuni with: mgradm install podman --ssl-ca-root RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT --ssl-server-cert server.crt --ssl-server-key server.key --ssl-db-ca-root RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT --ssl-db-server-cert server.crt --ssl-db-server-key server.key Checking the following hub configuration settings is optional. On the container host, find environment variables in /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-hub-xmlrpc.service generated by mgradm. If needed, you can customize these variables with Environment=settings in a user created /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-hub-xmlrpc.service.d/local.conf systemd configuration file on the container host. It will override settings in /etc/hub/hub.conf inside the server container. It is the same file for all containers. HUB_API_URL: URL to the Hub Server XMLRPC API endpoint. Use the default value if you are installing hub-xmlrpc-api on the Hub Server. It is set automatically in the systemd unit file during the installation. HUB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when connecting to a Server. Use the default value in most cases. HUB_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when calling a Server method. Use the default value in most cases. HUB_CONNECT_USING_SSL: use HTTPS instead of HTTP for communicating with peripheral Servers. Recommended for a secure environment. It is always enabled.","title":"Hub deployment with XMLRPC","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-install","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-install.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/MLM. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"429":{"id":429,"text":"Hub online synchronization reuses the existing repository synchronization and synchronizes channels in the peripheral servers from the repositories on the hub server. When the connection between hub and peripheral server is established, the hub server becomes the main source of data for the peripheral server. In case of vendor channels, hub server is effectively replacing SUSE Customer Center. In case of custom channels, when they are synchronized, the peripheral server will fetch the packages from the hub and not from the original location of the custom channel defined on the hub. The main characteristics of this feature are: There can only be one hub server per connection, with one or more peripheral servers. Each peripheral server can only have one hub server. Content can be synchronized on regular basis, or on demand. Hub online synchronization is configured from menu Admin Hub Configuration. Configuration process uses token which uniquely identifies peripheral server’s connection to the hub. There are two ways to register a peripheral server to the hub server: by using a combination of token creation on the peripheral, and subsequent registration on the hub server. This method uses Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server and Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token. by direct registration from the hub, without any user interactions with the peripheral server. This method is described in Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server. In any case, if the peripheral host should be managed by the hub, you must first bootstrap the host as a minion to the hub before proceeding with the registration of the peripheral server. If the bootstrapping happens later, two systems are shown in the systems list. Before being registered to the hub server, a token needs to be generated on the peripheral server and passed to the administrator of the hub server. Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server On the peripheral server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Access Tokens. Click button Add token and select option Issue new token. In the field Server FQDN on the form that opens type the FQDN of the hub server that will be using this token. Click Issue. A new form with the successfully generated token appears and button Copy. The only time token is displayed is at the time of its creation. Save it in a safe place until it is later needed. Once generated, the token appears on the screen Access Tokens. The generated token needs to be transferred to the hub server before it can be used. Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token On the hub server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Existing token. In the field Token paste the token that was created on the peripheral server. In the field Root CA certificate specify the certificate using one of the options: Use option Not needed if both hub and peripheral servers have the same certificate authority. Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate to paste a certificate. Click button Register. A newly registered peripheral server will appear on screen Peripherals Configuration. It is possible to initiate the registration of a peripheral server from hub server, without any interaction with the peripheral server. Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server On the hub server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Administrator User/Password. In the fields Username and Password enter the credentials for the peripheral server. The credentials must be those of SUSE Manager Administrator of the peripheral server. In the field Root CA certificate specify the certificate using one of the options: Use option Not needed if both hub and peripheral servers have the same certificate authority. Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate in cases when PEM certificate is used. Click button Register. The newly registered peripheral server will be shown in the Systems System List with the value Foreign in the column System Type. To access its details, click on the peripheral server’s name and select tab Details Peripheral Server. Peripheral server uses hub to access the vendor channels and does not connect to the SUSE Customer Center directly. Therefore, if you open configured peripheral server’s page Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials, Admin Setup Wizard Products or Admin Setup Wizard PAYG Connections, you will see a notification that this is peripheral server and its connections are managed via hub. All existing tokens are shown in Admin Hub Configuration Access Tokens. A token can viewed as Consumed and Issued, both from the perspective of the peripheral and the hub server. From the perspective of the peripheral server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the peripheral server and received by the hub server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the hub server to be used by the peripheral server. From the perspective of the hub server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the hub server and received by the peripheral server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the peripheral server to be used by the hub server. A token can be invalidated, or deleted. Be careful when using option Invalidate as it no longer grants access to the other server. This operation ensures that no communication will happen until a new token is generated if the existing one is compromised, or until the current token is reactivated. Invalidated token can be made valid again at any time. It is possible to delete a token. Deleting is only possible when the server associated with the token is not registered as hub or peripheral. This operation cannot be undone. Every peripheral server stores the information about its hub server. A peripheral server can only have one hub server configured. Procedure: Accessing hub server details On the peripheral server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Hub Details. On the screen Hub Details find the information about the hub server. Field Hub server FQDN shows the hub server’s FQDN. Field Registration date shows the time when the peripheral server was registered to the hub server. Field Last modified shows the time of the last saved configuration change. Field Root Certificate Authority shows certificate details. To download, edit or delete the root certificate, clicking Download, Edit or Delete respectively. Deleting the certificate will break the connection between servers. Field GPG Public Key shows whether the GPG key has been configured for the hub server. For more information about GPG keys between hub and peripheral servers, see GPG key usage with hub online synchronization. Field Mirror credentials is the username the peripheral server uses when connecting to the hub server to synchronize vendor channels. This username is generated automatically on the hub server, and then transmitted to the peripheral server during the registration phase. When the metadata on the hub server are signed with a GPG key, the public key is automatically transmitted from hub to peripheral server. By default, Uyuni is not signing metadata. Therefore, when the peripheral server is downloading data from the hub server there is no way of checking if the downloaded metadata have a valid signature, unless the customer has created their own GPG key. To enable checking of the data integrity, the GPG key needs to be created on the hub. When the peripheral server is configured to communicate with the hub, the public GPG key will then automatically be transferred to it. When the GPG key is created on the hub, field GPG Public Key will be set to show that this server is using the GPG key. For more information about setting up own GPG key, see 리포지토리 메타데이터.

The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. For more information about certificates, see Hub deployment with XMLRPC. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Navigate to Help Report Database Schema to find the schema documentation. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt Mine to check client availability. The Salt Mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. Since the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt Mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered clients will have the Salt Mine disabled by default. If the Salt Mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt Mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. There is no hard maximum number of supported systems. Many factors can affect how many clients can reliably be used in a particular installation. Factors can include which features are used, and how the hardware and systems are configured. There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information, see Install Uyuni Proxy. Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use Uyuni for Retail to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals. There is an introduction to Uyuni for Retail in this book. Tuning and monitoring large scale deployments can differ from smaller installations.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Multi-Linux Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. For more information about setting up and using Uyuni for Retail, see Retail Guide.","title":"Managing Large Scale Deployments in a Retail Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-large-scale","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/retail-large-scale.html","titles":[]},"436":{"id":436,"text":"This section discusses how to set up a single Uyuni Server to manage a large number of clients.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters.

Check thread_pool, as each thread might perform Salt API calls, starvation might happen if the allocated Salt thread pool is insufficient. Check Tomcat’s -Xmx, as each thread consumes memory, OutOfMemoryException might be raised if insufficient. More information man rhn.conf Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. This parameter sets the amount of time before a second command (in most cases state.apply or any other Salt function) is sent to the client to verify its presence. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for <COMMAND> on minion <MINION_ID> (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 4 seconds Value recommendation 4-20 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_timeout = 10 After changing Large java.salt_presence_ping_timeout value can reduce overall throughput. This can be compensated by increasing java.salt_event_thread_pool_size More information Salt Timeouts Description Before any action is executed on a client, a presence ping is executed to make sure the client is reachable. After java.salt_presence_ping_timeout seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (in most cases state.apply or any other Salt function) is sent to the client and if there is no response from the client for the amount of seconds specified with this parameter one more call (saltutil.find_job) is sent for a final check. This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered timeout. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for <COMMAND> on minion <MINION_ID> (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 1 second Value recommendation 1-50 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 20 More information Salt Timeouts Description Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it. Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count becomes larger than 50, or more concurrent operations on channels are expected. Value default 2 Value recommendation 2-10 Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers = 4 After changing Check taskomatic.java.maxmemory for adjustment, as every new thread will consume memory More information man rhn.conf Description The maximum amount of memory Taskomatic can use. Generation of metadata, especially for some OSs, can be memory-intensive, so this parameter might need raising depending on the managed OS mix. Tune when java.taskomatic_channel_repodata_workers increases, OSs are added to Uyuni (particularly Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Ubuntu), or OutOfMemoryException errors appear in /var/log/rhn/rhn_taskomatic_daemon.log.

If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving. Value default 20 Value recommendation 100 to 200, higher than the maximum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size + maxThreads and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example hibernate.c3p0.max_size = 100 After changing Check max_connections for adjustment. More information https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize Description The maximum amount of memory that the rhn-search service can use. Tune when Client count increases significantly, and OutOfMemoryException errors appear in journalctl -u rhn-search. Value default 512 MiB Value recommendation 512-4096 MiB Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example rhn-search.java.maxmemory = 4096 After changing Check memory usage.

More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation Depends on other settings, use /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/susemanager-connection-check to obtain a recommendation. Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-pgsql/_data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Setting this value to very high values could cause opposite effect as the workers will compete to each other for the CPU resources and the performance could be dropped significantly. Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master could be a sign of too low or too high value of this parameter. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-32, depending on the number of the CPU cores available for the server, it is recommended to keep the value slightly less than the number of CPU cores. Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 16 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. It makes sense to monitor the salt-master stats event by enabling master_stats and adjusting master_stats_event_iter to fine tune the value of this parameter. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description Determines whether the master will fire authentication events. Authentication events are fired when a minion performs an authentication check with the master. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of salt/auth events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example auth_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#auth-events Description Determines whether the master will fire minion data cache events (minion/refresh/*). Minion data cache events are fired when a minion requests a minion data cache refresh. It helps to reduce the number of events published with the Salt Master Event Publisher and reduce the workload on Event Publisher subscribers. Tune when Large amount of minion/refresh/* events published in the Salt event bus, which in most cases are useless for the subscribers. Value default True Value recommendation False Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example minion_data_cache_events: False More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#minion-data-cache-events Description The maximum number of outstanding messages sent by salt-master. If more than this number of messages need to be sent concurrently, communication with clients slows down, potentially resulting in timeout errors during load peaks. Tune when Client count increases significantly and Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. errors appear when pinging minions during a load peak. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 10000-100000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example pub_hwm: 10000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pub-hwm, https://zeromq.org/socket-api/#high-water-mark Description The maximum number of allowed client connections that have started but not concluded the opening process. If more than this number of clients connects in a very short time frame, connections are dropped and clients experience a delay re-connecting. Tune when Client count increases significantly and very many clients reconnect in a short time frame, TCP connections to the salt-master process get dropped by the kernel. Value default 1000 Value recommendation 1000-5000 Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example zmq_backlog: 2000 More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#zmq-backlog, http://api.zeromq.org/3-0:zmq-getsockopt (ZMQ_BACKLOG) Description How aggressively the kernel moves unused data from memory to the swap partition. Setting a lower parameter typically reduces swap usage and results in better performance, especially when RAM memory is abundant. Tune when RAM increases, or swap is used when RAM memory is sufficient. Value default 60 Value recommendation 1-60. For 128 GB of RAM, 10 is expected to give good results. Location /etc/sysctl.conf Example vm.swappiness = 20 More information https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-tuning-memory.html#cha-tuning-memory-vm Description Determines whether the salt-broker service should wait for backend sockets to be connected before opening the sockets for listening for connections from salt-minions. When enabled, it helps to prevent collecting ZeroMQ messages with the internal buffers of the sockets and pushing them to the salt-master once connection is restored. Tune when Unstable connectivity between the Uyuni Proxy and the Uyuni Server. Value default False Value recommendation True Location /etc/salt/broker Example wait_for_backend: True More information Proxies Connectivity Description The tcp keepalive interval to set on TCP ports. This setting can be used to tune Salt connectivity issues in messy network environments with misbehaving firewalls. Tune when Unstable connectivity between managed clients and the Uyuni Proxy or the Uyuni Server. Value default True Value recommendation True Location /etc/venv-salt-minon/minion.d/tuning.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning.conf, depending on the minion type. Example tcp_keepalive: True After changing Check Minions Connectivity for more details to fine tune extra keepalive parameters. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/minion.html#tcp-keepalive, Minions Connectivity Adjusting some of the parameters listed in this section can result in a higher amount of RAM being used by various components. It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

PINT is available at pint.suse.com and provided as an API and command-line tool with the python3-susepubliccloudinfo package from the Public Cloud Module repository. To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand over to Global Technical Support, use the command supportconfig. The command-line tool is provided by the package supportutils which is installed by default. Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these packages integrate supportconfig plug-ins. When supportconfig is executed, all plug-ins are executed as well, creating one or more result files for the archive. This has the benefit that the only topics checked are those that contain a specific plug-in for them. supportconfig plug-ins are stored in directory /usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/. The following procedure shows how to create a supportconfig archive, but without submitting it to support directly. Procedure: Creating a supportconfig Archive Run supportconfig as root. Usually, it is enough to run this tool without any options. Some options are very common and are displayed in the following list: Listing 1. Options: -E MAIL, -N NAME, -O COMPANY, -P PHONE Sets your contact data: e-mail address (-E) Company name (-O) Your name (-N) Your phone number (-P) -i KEYWORDS, -F Limits the features to check. The placeholder KEYWORDS is a comma-separated list of case-sensitive keywords. Get a list of all keywords with supportconfig -F. Wait for the tool to complete the operation. The default archive location is /var/log, with the file name format being scc_HOST_DATE_TIME.txz To open a new support case for your cloud Pay-as-you-go instance, you need to generate a supportconfig file and then follow the steps listed on: SUSE Customer Center Cloudsupport This service serves billing data from Uyuni for the CSP-billing-adapter.

Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP4/html/SLES-SAP-installation/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 일반 요구사항. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox. In the Activation Key field, select the SLES for SAP activation key.

There are no common recommendations for all the possible use cases as the environments could be very different expecially if public clouds instances are involved. In case clients are losing the connection to the Uyuni Server (or Uyuni Proxy if involved), they are unreachable from the Uyuni Server Web UI or with command line tools. To understand such a connection issue check if the client is not reachable from the Uyuni Server with salt MINION_ID test.ping, while venv-salt-call test.ping (or salt-call test.ping if non-bundle Salt is used on the client) is working fine on the client side. If this is the case, it is recommended to set tcp_keepalive parameters. The parameters with the values from the example below can be used as a starting point to look for settings, which could prevent cases of connection loss without restoring for some environments. It is recommended to put the parameters in the separate drop-in configuration file like /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf, depending on the minion type used on the client side. Listing 1. Example: Keepalive Parameters Example Values ###### Keepalive settings ###### ############################################ # ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by # the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through # a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is # the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion # without informing either party that their connection has been taken away. # Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening. # Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False) # or leave to the OS defaults (-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled. tcp_keepalive: True # How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300 # to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (-1) is typically 7200 seconds # on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time. tcp_keepalive_idle: 10 # How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default -1 # to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes. tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3 # How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default -1 to # use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see # /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl. tcp_keepalive_intvl: 10 salt-broker service is used on Uyuni Proxies to forward Salt traffic between the Uyuni Server and salt-minion service used on the client side. It is possible that salt-broker and all the clients behind it could be affected with the same issue as the clients directly connected to the Uyuni Server. The issue could be fixed with the same parameters as recommended for the minions, but specified in /etc/salt/broker on each Uyuni Proxy. Uyuni Proxy connectivity can also suffer when the connectivity to the Uyuni Server is lost for a quite long interval. In such a case Proxy connected clients started to retry the authentication to the salt-master service on the Uyuni Server. This situation could be potentially dangerous because it could lead to collecting large amount of ZeroMQ messages with authentication attemps in the interal buffer of ZeroMQ sockets used inside the salt-broker service. Then, on restoring the connection to the salt-master all of the pending messages will be pushed to it. It could lead to the issues on Uyuni Server side with salt-master service, because it could be impossible to serve all the cached requests in appropriate time or even to the complete denial of the service. To avoid such situation a set of tuning parameters is available. As the most important one, wait_for_backend should be set to True. This prevents opening the sockets for the clients behind the proxy while the connectivity to the salt-master service is not established. In this case the messages from the clients are not collected in the internal buffers. drop_after_retries is setting the number of retries before closing the sockets to drop the cached messages. The other parameters could help to fine tune the behavior for the environment. Setting timeouts, intervals and drop_after_retries to lower values are making salt-broker service more aggressive on detecting the connection loss to the salt-master, so that it puts the clients behind the proxy to the conditions closer as they are connected directly to the Uyuni Server. Increasing the values could provide some benefits in case if the network channel between the Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni Server is not stable enough, the message buffering can provide some flexibility while re-establishing the connection. Listing 2. Example: Values for Keepalive Parameters ###### ZeroMQ connection options ###### ############################################ # For more details about the following parameters check ZeroMQ documentation: # http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-setsockopt # All of these parameters will be set to the backend sockets # (from the salt-broker to the salt-master) # connect_timeout (sets ZMQ_CONNECT_TIMEOUT) # default: 0 # value unit: milliseconds # Sets how long to wait before timing-out a connect to the remote socket. # 0 could take much time, so it could be better to set to more strict value # for particular environment depending on the network conditions. # The value equal to 10000 is setting 10 seconds connect timeout. connect_timeout: 3000 # reconnect_ivl (sets ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL) # default: 100 # value unit: milliseconds # Sets the interval of time before reconnection attempt on connection drop. reconnect_ivl: 1000 # heartbeat_ivl (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_IVL) # default: 0 # value unit: milliseconds # This parameter is important for detection of loosing the connection. # In case of value equal to 0 it is not sending heartbits. # It's better to set to more relevant value for the particular environment, # depending on possible network issues. # The value equal to 20000 (20 seconds) works good for most cases. heartbeat_ivl: 5000 # heartbeat_timeout (sets ZMQ_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT) # default: 0 # value unit: milliseconds # Sets the interval of time to consider that the connection is timed out # after sending the heartbeat and not getting the response on it. # The value equal to 60000 (1 minute) is considering the connection is down # after 1 minute of no response to the heartbeat. heartbeat_timeout: 10000 ###### Other connection options ###### # The following parameters are not related to ZeroMQ, # but the internal parameters of the salt-broker. # drop_after_retries # default: -1 # value unit: number of retries # Drop the frontend sockets of the salt-broker in case if it reaches # the number of retries to reconnect to the backend socket. # -1 means not drop the frontend sockets # It's better to choose more relevant value for the particular environment. # 10 can be a good choise for most of the cases. drop_after_retries: 5 # wait_for_backend # default: False # The main aim of this parameter is to prevent collecting the messages # with the open frontend socket and prevent pushing them on connecting # the backend socket to prevent large number of messages to be pushed # at once to salt-master. # It's better to set it to True if there is significant numer of minions # behind the salt-broker. wait_for_backend: True","title":"Salt Connectivity","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-connectivity","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-connectivity.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

If you want to reference file templates in this configuration channel, ensure your file starts by specifying the source of the managed file, using this syntax: file.managed: - source: salt://<org_name>/<channel_name>/etc/<ID>/<filename> Example custom state files are given later in this section. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. Procedure: Adding Additional Files to a Custom State Channel In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. . Click the name of the channel you want to add files to. To create a new file, click Create configuration file and type the contents of the file. To upload an existing file, click Upload Configuration Files and select the file to upload. To copy an existing file, click Import a File from Another Channel or System and select the file to copy. Procedure: Editing a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click View/Edit <filename>.sls File. Make your changes to the file. Click Update Configuration File to save your state. You can also manage revisions, compare the state to others in your organization, and download the .sls file from this dialog. Procedure: Assigning a Client to a Custom Salt State In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. Navigate to the Systems Target Systems tab. Check the clients you want to assign. Click Subscribe systems. For more information about Salt state modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/index.html. This section contains some example custom state files. Use these as a basis for writing your own custom states. Listing 1. Example: Manage a File my_config_change_id: file.managed: - name: /etc/my.conf - source: salt://example_org/example_channel/etc/my.conf - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 - template: jinja Listing 2. Example: Package Management my_pkg_id: pkg.installed: - refresh: True - pkgs: - glibc - kernel-default - hello: 1.0-42 Listing 3. Example: Remote Command ip_forward-on: cmd.run: - name: echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - onlyif: - test `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` -eq 0 Listing 4. Example: Service Management time_service_id: service.running: - name: chronyd - enable: True By default, operating systems trust only their own GPG keys when they are installed, and do not trust keys provided by third party packages. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all user public files must be saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey-<key_id> deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls. This short example maps the test state to the system group 12: # /srv/salt/top.sls base: 'group_ids:12': - match: pillar - test","title":"Custom Salt States","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-custom-states","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-custom-states.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of Saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders. In the Configured Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.com). In the Type field, select master.

The formula is used only for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3. with Uyuni Server 2025.10. Do not use this formula if you want to connect Uyuni Proxy 2025.10. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services.

For example: SALT_TIMEOUT=300 DISABLE_HOSTNAME_ID If the terminal has a hostname assigned by DHCP, it is by default used as a minion ID. Setting this option to 1 disables this mechanism, and SMBios information will be used as a minion ID. DISABLE_UNIQUE_SUFFIX Setting this option to 1 disables adding random generated suffix to terminal minion ID. If you set this parameter make sure your terminal has either a unique hostname provided by DHCP and DNS, or the terminal hardware comes with a unique serial number stored in its SMBios memory. Otherwise there is a risk of terminal minion ID duplicity, and bootstrapping the minion will fail.

You can write your own custom formulas, and make them available to client systems in the Uyuni Web UI. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directory also contains an optional metadata.yml file with additional information about the formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt/<custom-formula-name>/ Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/ All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a <field name>: null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/MLM_minion.py The process is executed like this: The MLM_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (MLM_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Getting the statistics based on the events published in the Salt event bus can help to identify possible weak points and perform Salt internals profiling. Saline is a powerful tool designed to function as a Prometheus exporter, enabling the collection of metrics based on events from the Salt event bus. These metrics are derived from event data available on the Salt master, similar to what is accessible through the command: mgrctl exec -ti -- salt-run state.event Saline is distributed as a separate container image, server-saline, for use with Uyuni Server. All related commands and operations should be executed on the Uyuni Server container host system. In addition to its role as a Prometheus exporter, Saline also provides the saline-formula, which simplifies configuration of Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, enhancing monitoring and visualization capabilities. Deployment instructions depend on when the customer decides to enable Saline. Saline can be deployed during the initial installation or an upgrade of the Uyuni server, by using command: mgradm install podman --saline-replicas 1 If the Uyuni server is already installed, you can enable Saline support without running a full server upgrade with this command: mgradm scale uyuni-saline --replicas 1 If you want to upgrade and add Saline with one single command, use: mgradm upgrade podman && mgradm scale uyuni-saline --replicas 1 In all scenarios, the only possible values for --saline-replicas are 1 or 0. After finishing the deployment Uyuni-saline.service should be configured on the Uyuni Server host system. It is recommended to add master_stats: True and adjust the value of master_stats_event_iter: 60 if needed. Then restart salt-master to get the detailed statistics of internal Salt calls. This can be help with tuning large scale deployment installations. To configure Prometheus and Grafana dashboards, see Saline Formula. To remove Saline from the Uyuni Server use mgradm upgrade podman with --saline-replicas 0. The dashboard represents Salt events with the different views presented on the panels.

This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.

SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: <USER> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://MLM-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the MLM-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost MLM-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to MLM-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:MLM-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to MLM-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file=<temporary_bootstrap_roster> minion state.apply certs,<bootstrap_state>` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time. The SSH key is used on salt-ssh managed systems. Additionally, it is used on Uyuni Proxies for the user mgrsshtunnel. Normal systems managed with the Salt default method are not affected and do not have this key configured. Procedure: Rotating SSH keys On the Uyuni Server, as user root, change to user salt: su -s /bin/bash - salt Create a new SSH key: ssh-keygen -N \"\" -t rsa -q -f /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id Copy the public key into the Salt filesystem to make it usable in a Salt state: cp /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id.pub /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ Change back to user root again: exit Rollout the new key to all systems that need it. Applying the util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key state will limit the changes to salt-ssh managed systems and proxies: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key Move the old key away and make the new key the standard key. Rename mgr_ssh_id key to disabled_mgr_ssh_id and new_mgr_ssh_id key to mgr_ssh_id in the SSH keystore of the user salt as well as in the Salt filesystem for the public keys: su -s /bin/bash - salt cd .ssh mv mgr_ssh_id disabled_mgr_ssh_id mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id mgr_ssh_id mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub cd /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub OPTIONAL: When containerized proxies exist, re-create the configuration to get the new SSH key into the proxy configuration. Restart the containers with the new configuration. It is also possible to change the existing configuration on the podman host (ssh.yaml). Change the value of server_ssh_key_pub with the content of the current mgr_ssh_id.pub. To remove the disabled keys from the authorized_keys` files of the [literal]salt-ssh`` managed systems and the proxies, apply the state a second time: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see 사용자 정의 시스템 정보. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. If you change pillar data on the server (Salt master) the actual pillar data on the client (minion) is updated only after calling saltutil.refresh_pillar for the client. Otherwise it could happen that pillar.items and pillar.get calls would produce different results with different values of pillars that were not refreshed. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring. When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor. To use beacons on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Salt clients, install the python-pyinotify package. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, install the python-inotify package. For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are sometimes referred to as Salt clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step. For more information on states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html.

These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A Salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (java.salt_presence_ping_timeout/java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here.

Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Multi-Linux Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp://<server-address>/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It assumes that the proxy host system has already been bootstrapped, is subscribed to the base operating system channel (such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 or SL Micro 6.1) and to the Proxy Extension channel. For information about client onboarding, see 클라이언트 등록. Before starting the conversion, ensure the following requirements are fulfilled. Only the following operating systems are currently supported for proxy conversion: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 SL Micro 6.1 Already onboarded in Uyuni Reachable via the network Subscribed to the appropriate proxy extension channel: Uyuni Proxy Extension 5.1 (matching architecture) Before proceeding with the proxy conversion, make sure the following preparations are completed to avoid interruptions during the conversion process. Valid SSL certificates are required to secure communication between the proxy and other components. You need: The public certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed the certificate on the Uyuni server A certificate for the proxy. The corresponding private key for the proxy certificate. If your CA uses an intermediate certificate chain, you must include all intermediate certificates as well. If you are not using third party certificates, you can generate them using the rhn-ssl-tool inside the Uyuni container. Generate a proxy certificate On the Uyuni server host, run: mgrctl exec -ti -- rhn-ssl-tool --gen-server \\ --set-hostname=\"<PROXY-FQDN>\" \\ --dir=\"/root/ssl-build\" For more information about other parameters, see 자체 서명된 SSL 인증서.

Table 1. 소프트웨어 및 하드웨어 요구사항 Software and Hardware Recommended Operating System SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 Architecture x86-64, ARM, s390x, ppc64le Processor (CPU) Minimum of four (4) 64-bit CPU cores RAM 16 GB Disk Space 200 GB Channel Requirements 50 GB per SUSE or openSUSE product 360 GB per Red Hat product Swap space: 8 to 12 GB 서버 컨테이너 호스트에 지원되는 운영 체제 The supported operating system for the container host is SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. 컨테이너 호스트 A container host is a server equipped with a container engine like Podman, which lets it manage and deploy containers. These containers hold applications and their essential parts, such as libraries, but not a full operating system, making them lightweight. This setup ensures applications run the same way in different environments. The container host supplies the necessary resources such as CPU, memory, and storage for these containers. 서버를 배포하려면 FQDN(정규화된 도메인 이름)을 사용해야 합니다. 라우터 또는 네트워크에서 FQDN을 자동으로 DNS 프로비저닝하지 않으면 배포 프로세스가 성공적으로 진행되지 않습니다. FQDN은 일반적으로 <호스트>.<도메인>.com 형식을 따릅니다. 예: mlm.example.com mlm.container.lab 자세한 내용은 네트워크 요구사항의 네트워크 요구사항 섹션을 참조하십시오. Uyuni 2025.10은(는) 기본적으로 필요한 영구 스토리지 볼륨을 정의합니다. 이러한 볼륨이 아직 없다면 설치 중에 mgradm 도구에 의해 볼륨이 생성됩니다. 이러한 볼륨은 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/에 생성되며, Podman은 기본적으로 해당 볼륨을 저장합니다. 권장 이 디렉토리에 외부 스토리지 장치를 마운트하여 간소화된 스토리지를 활용할 수 있습니다. 여기에는 PostgreSQL 데이터베이스, 리포지토리용 이진 패키지, 캐시, 운영 체제 이미지, 자동 설치 배포 및 구성 파일이 저장되므로 다음과 같은 3가지 권장 사항이 있습니다. 고속 스토리지 이 탑재 지점은 NVMe 또는 SSD급 장치를 사용하는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 스토리지 속도가 느리면 Uyuni의 성능에 부정적인 영향을 미칩니다. 대용량 이를 위한 최소 권장 크기는 300GB 이상이며, 관리해야 할 Linux 배포 또는 아키텍처가 여러 개일 경우 더 큰 크기가 권장됩니다. 권장 파일 시스템 XFS (though any supported filesystem for SL Micro 6.1 could work). 선택 사항 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk와 같은 예상 볼륨 경로에 디스크를 마운트하여 볼륨에 대한 사용자 지정 스토리지를 제공할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 Uyuni 배포의 복잡도가 높아지며 기본 스토리지 권장 사항이 제공하는 복원력에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 컨테이너의 모든 영구 볼륨 목록은 Persistent Container Volumes에서 확인할 수 있습니다. You can deploy Uyuni on SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. SL Micro is a transactional system, while SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is a full server operating system.

This section provides steps on registering your products after SL Micro 6.1 installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: transactional-update --quiet register --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install: If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with following command: transactional-update register -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy/5.1/x86_64 -r <reg_code> 재부팅합니다. Procedure: Updating the system root로 로그인합니다. transactional-update 실행: transactional-update 재부팅합니다. SL Micro is designed to update itself automatically by default and will reboot after applying updates. However, this behavior is not desirable for the Uyuni environment. To prevent automatic updates on your server, Uyuni disables the transactional-update timer during the bootstrap process. If you prefer the SL Micro default behavior, enable the timer by running the following command: systemctl enable --now transactional-update.timer To continue with deployment, see 사용자 정의 영구 스토리지 구성. Alternatively, you can deploy Uyuni on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. The following procedures describe the main steps of the installation process. Procedure: Installing Uyuni Extensions on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Locate and download SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 .iso at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/.

In the screen Extensions and Modules Selection check the following: Select the Uyuni Server Extension to install the Server, or the Uyuni Proxy Extension to install the Proxy. Basesystem Module Containers Module 다음을 클릭하여 계속합니다. Enter your Uyuni 2025.10 extension registration code. 다음을 클릭하여 계속합니다. 설치를 완료합니다. When the installation completes, log in to the newly installed server as root. Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install): zypper up 재부팅합니다. If you added Uyuni 2025.10 as an extension during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: SUSEConnect --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install. If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code. For example for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP7, use the following commands: SUSEConnect -r <regcode> SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.7/x86_64 SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with the following command: SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> Procedure: Installing podman Log in as root and install podman plus, on the server, mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion or, on the proxies, mgrpxy and mgrpxy-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): On the server: zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion On the proxies: zypper install podman mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service To continue with deployment, see 사용자 정의 영구 스토리지 구성. 영구 스토리지 구성은 선택 사항이지만, 컨테이너 디스크가 가득 찬 상황에 심각한 문제를 방지할 수 있는 유일한 방법입니다. mgr-storage-server 도구를 사용하여 사용자 지정 영구 스토리지를 구성하는 것이 적극 권장됩니다. 자세한 내용은 mgr-storage-server --help를 참조하십시오. 이 도구는 컨테이너 스토리지 및 데이터베이스 볼륨 생성을 간소화합니다. 다음 방법으로 명령 사용: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] 예: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 이 명령은 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes에 영구 스토리지 볼륨을 생성합니다. For more information, see Persistent Container Volumes 전체 디스크 이벤트 포함 컨테이너 문제 해결 If you want to use third-party SSL certificates instead of the self-signed certificates, import them in the run of the following deployment procedure. For more information about the requirements of third-party SSL certificates, see SSL 인증서 임포트. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. 예: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. Procedure: Deploying Uyuni 2025.10 Using mgradm 루트로 로그인합니다. Deploy Uyuni. If you use VM images as a migration target, here as the last step, execute the command mgradm migrate instead of mgradm install. Execute one of the following commands, depending on the SSL certificate variant (self-signed or third-party). Replace <FQDN> with your fully qualified domain name of the Uyuni Server: Using self-signed certificates provided by Uyuni: mgradm install podman <FQDN> With importing SSL certificates using third-party SSL certificate flags (the example can adjusted if not all these certificates are needed): mgradm install podman <FQDN> \\ --ssl-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-server-cert <string> \\ --ssl-server-key <string> \\ --ssl-db-ca-intermediate <strings> \\ --ssl-db-ca-root <string> \\ --ssl-db-cert <string> \\ --ssl-db-key <string> For more information, see mgradm install podman --help. If the executed command fails ensure that you have registered Uyuni 2025.10. If you skipped registration during installation and now need to register from the command line, follow the steps below to log in to the registry: podman login -u <EMAIL> -p <REGISTRATION-CODE> registry.suse.com 메시지가 표시되면 Uyuni 2025.10 등록 키를 사용합니다.

This guide was tested on Tumbleweed only. There is no known reason it wouldn’t work on other supported bases, but always validate in a test environment before production. You will: Save proxy configuration from the old system (including Apache/Squid tuning). Reinstall the host with openSUSE Tumbleweed. Re-register the host using the system reactivation key. Install mgrpxy (and Podman if needed). Restore configuration and run mgrpxy install podman with optional tuning files. Keep the same hostname/FQDN and IP when possible so the server and clients interact with the proxy as before. Ensure you have the “system reactivation key” for the existing proxy system (UI: Systems > select the proxy > Details > Reactivation). Ensure SSH/scp access to move configuration archives off and onto the machine. Procedure: Save Proxy Configuration and Tuning Files Copy the Uyuni proxy configuration directory to a safe location: scp -r /etc/uyuni <USER>@<HOST>:/some/where/safe/ Identify Apache and Squid tuning files currently in use by the legacy proxy services: systemctl cat uyuni-proxy-httpd.service | grep EXTRA_CONF= | sed 's/.*=-v\\([^:]\\+\\):.*/\\1/' systemctl cat uyuni-proxy-squid.service | grep EXTRA_CONF= | sed 's/.*=-v\\([^:]\\+\\):.*/\\1/' Copy those tuning files to the same safe location as well. Typical default paths after you copy them back will be: Apache tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf Squid tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf Procedure: Reinstalling the Host with openSUSE Tumbleweed Reinstall the machine with openSUSE Tumbleweed (server profile recommended). Set the same hostname/FQDN and IP as before when possible. Procedure: Re-registering the Host with the Reactivation Key From the Uyuni Web UI, obtain the system reactivation key for the existing proxy system record (Systems > Details > Reactivation). Bootstrap/re-register the Tumbleweed host using that reactivation key so it claims the existing system entry. Use your standard bootstrapping process for Tumbleweed hosts in your environment (for example, the bootstrap script or your configuration management), ensuring the reactivation key is applied. Procedure: Installing Proxy Tools and Podman Add the Uyuni Stable repository and install tools: zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Proxy-POOL-x86_64-Media1 uyuni-proxy-stable zypper ref zypper in mgrpxy mgrctl mgrpxy-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion Ensure Podman is installed (required to run containers): zypper in podman Procedure: Restoring Configuration and Install the Proxy Copy back the saved configuration directory to the new host: scp -r <USER>@<HOST>:/some/where/safe/uyuni /etc/ If you saved Apache/Squid tuning files, place them at the expected default paths or note their locations for parameters in the next command: # Default paths expected by mgrpxy parameters (adjust/move your files accordingly) # Apache tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf # Squid tuning: /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf Run the proxy installation with Podman. If you do not use tuning files, omit the corresponding parameters: # With tuning files mgrpxy install podman \\ --tuning-httpd /etc/uyuni/proxy/apache.conf \\ --tuning-squid /etc/uyuni/proxy/squid.conf # If you have no tuning files, remove the tuning parameters: # mgrpxy install podman In an upcoming release, if tuning files are placed at the default paths noted above, the explicit parameters will not be required. Procedure: Verifying the Proxy Check containers are running: mgrctl ps # or podman ps Confirm the proxy appears healthy in the Uyuni Web UI and that clients using this proxy operate normally. If Podman was missing, install it and rerun the mgrpxy install step. Verify the host’s time, hostname, and IP match expectations. If the host did not reattach to the existing system record, confirm you used the correct reactivation key and repeat the bootstrap.","title":"Migrating the Uyuni Proxy to openSUSE Tumbleweed","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"migrate-uyuni-proxy-from-micro55-tumbleweed","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/uyuni/migrate-uyuni-proxy-from-micro55-tumbleweed.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You will: Create a full server backup with mgradm backup on the openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 host. Reinstall the host with openSUSE Tumbleweed (server profile). Install Uyuni tools and prerequisites on Tumbleweed. Restore the backup with mgradm backup restore. Start services and verify the server. Source server: openSUSE Leap Micro 5.5 running Uyuni (for example: 2025.10). Target server: openSUSE Tumbleweed with the same hostname/FQDN and IP (recommended) to avoid client-side changes. SSH/scp access between machines for transferring the backup tarball. Sufficient free disk space on both source and target for the backup and restore. Restore to the same Uyuni version you backed up, or a version explicitly documented as compatible for restore. If you use development or preview repositories (for example, Uyuni Master), expect changes and re-validate. Procedure: Create a Backup As root on the old server, create a backup directory and run the backup: mgradm backup /tmp/uyuni-backup Package the backup for transfer: tar -C /tmp -cvf /tmp/uyuni-backup.tar uyuni-backup Copy the backup to a safe location you can reach from the new host: scp /tmp/uyuni-backup.tar <USER>@<HOST>:/path/to/store/ You can store the backup to external storage or an object store as long as you can fetch it on the new host.

Access the Web UI (HTTPS) and log in. Review logs for errors: mgrctl logs server and other components as needed. _ If Podman wasn’t installed automatically, install it with zypper in podman and rerun the restore/start steps. Ensure the target host has the same time, hostname, and IP configuration expected by your setup (especially if clients exist). For large environments, ensure adequate disk throughput and space.

In the context of this migration, the legacy Uyuni Server (RPM installation) is sometimes also called old server. Neither in-place migration is not possible nor allows the migration procedure currently any hostname renaming functionality. Thus the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the new server will remain identical to that on the legacy server. After migration, it is necessary to update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. For more information, see Finalize migration. SSL certificates are needed at a later stage. If not using the self-signed generated CA and certificates, ensure you have the following before starting: A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate. If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available. An SSL database private key. An SSL database certificate. All files must be in PEM format. The hostname of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on. You can set the hostnames in the X509v3 Subject Alternative Name section of the certificate. You can also list multiple hostnames if your environment requires it. Supported Key types are RSA and EC (Elliptic Curve). Database SSL certificate requires reportdb and db and the FQDN used to access the report database as Subject Alternative Name. During a migration, the server SSL certificate and CA chain are copied from the source server, meaning that only the database certificates are required Self trusted GPG keys are not migrated. GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated. Thus synchronizing channels with spacewalk-repo-sync can fail. The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the legacy Uyuni installation to the container host after the actual server migration. Procedure: Manual Migration of the GPG Keys to New Server Copy the keys from the legacy Uyuni server to the container host of the new server. 그 후, mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> 명령을 사용하여 마이그레이션된 서버에 각 키를 추가합니다. The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the legacy server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration the processes on the legacy server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping the services on the legacy server. For example: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare Procedure: Initial Preparation on the Legacy Server Uyuni 서비스를 중지합니다. spacewalk-service stop PostgreSQL 서비스를 중지합니다. systemctl stop postgresql 절차: SSH 연결 준비 Ensure that for root an SSH key exists on the new 2025.10 server. If a key does not exist, create it with the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server host for a connection to the legacy server that does not prompt for a password. eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add To establish a connection without prompting for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server. If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add followed by the path to the private key. You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. Copy the public SSH key to the legacy Uyuni Server (<oldserver.fqdn>) with ssh-copy-id. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: ssh-copy-id <oldserver.fqdn> The SSH key will be copied into the legacy server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. For more information, see the ssh-copy-id manpage. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the legacy Uyuni Server to check that no password is needed. Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint. In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Then try again. The fingerprint will be stored in the local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. When planning your migration from a legacy Uyuni to a containerized Uyuni, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the legacy setup. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. 예: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. 영구 스토리지 구성은 선택 사항이지만, 컨테이너 디스크가 가득 찬 상황에 심각한 문제를 방지할 수 있는 유일한 방법입니다. mgr-storage-server 도구를 사용하여 사용자 지정 영구 스토리지를 구성하는 것이 적극 권장됩니다. 자세한 내용은 mgr-storage-server --help를 참조하십시오. 이 도구는 컨테이너 스토리지 및 데이터베이스 볼륨 생성을 간소화합니다. 다음 방법으로 명령 사용: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] Devices must not have any filesystem. The command aborts if a filesystem exists on the storage device. 예: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 이 명령은 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes에 영구 스토리지 볼륨을 생성합니다.

Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 신뢰할 수 있는 SSL CA 인증서를 마이그레이션합니다. Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on a legacy Uyuni in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the legacy installation after migration: Procedure: Migrating the Certificates Copy the file from the legacy server to the new server. 예를 들어 /local/ca.file일 수 있습니다. Copy the file into the container with the command: mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server. To redirect them to the new 2025.10 server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as the legacy server. If something goes wrong with the migration it is possible to restart the old system. As root, restart PostgreSQL and the spacewalk services with the following commands: service postgresql start spacewalk-service start Before executing the migration with mgradm migrate command, it is essential to predefine Persistent Volumes, especially considering that the migration job initiates the container from scratch. For more information, see the installation section on preparing these volumes in Persistent Container Volumes. Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server, replacing <oldserver.fqdn> with the appropriate FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 또는 mgradm migrate kubernetes <oldserver.fqdn> After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server.

Procedure: Installing Uyuni Tools on openSUSE Tumbleweed On your local host, open a terminal window and log in. Add the following repository to your openSUSE Tumbleweed server. You might need to use sudo for the following commands. zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/Uyuni:/Stable/images/repo/Uyuni-Server-POOL-$(arch)-Media1/ uyuni-server-stable Refresh the repository list and import the key: zypper ref When prompted, trust and import the new repository GPG key. 컨테이너 도구를 설치합니다. zypper in mgradm mgrctl mgradm-bash-completion mgrctl-bash-completion uyuni-storage-setup-server Uyuni 컨테이너 유틸리티에 대한 자세한 내용은 Uyuni 컨테이너 유틸리티를 참조하십시오. 이 단계는 선택 사항입니다. 그러나 인프라에 사용자 정의 영구 스토리지가 필요한 경우 mgr-storage-server 도구를 사용하십시오. 자세한 내용은 mgr-storage-server --help를 참조하십시오. 이 도구는 컨테이너 스토리지 및 데이터베이스 볼륨 생성을 간소화합니다. 다음 방법으로 명령 사용: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] 예: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 이 명령은 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes에 영구 스토리지 볼륨을 생성합니다. 자세한 내용은 Persistent Container Volumes에서 확인할 수 있습니다. [command] mgradm 도구를 사용하여 Uyuni을(를) 컨테이너로 배포합니다. Uyuni 서버는 2가지 방법으로 컨테이너로 배포할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에서는 기본 컨테이너 배포를 중심으로 설명합니다. 사용자 정의 구성 파일을 사용하여 배포하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 mgradm을 사용하여 사용자 지정 YAML 구성 및 배포에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 명령줄에서 mgradm --help를 실행하여 확인할 수 있습니다. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. 예: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. 절차: Podman을 사용한 Uyuni 컨테이너 배포 터미널에서 sudo 사용자 또는 루트로 다음 명령을 실행합니다. sudo mgradm install podman 컨테이너를 sudo 또는 루트로 배포해야 합니다. 이 단계를 건너뛰면 터미널에 다음과 같은 오류가 표시됩니다.

If you are just testing out Uyuni you do not need to specify these volumes. mgradm will setup the correct volumes by default. 볼륨 위치 지정은 일반적으로 대규모 프로덕션 배포에서 사용됩니다. 기본적으로 [command] podman은 볼륨을 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/에 저장합니다. You can provide custom storage for the volumes by mounting disks on this path or the expected volume path inside it such as: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes/var-spacewalk.

We have tested using Uyuni on Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure, but these procedures should work with other public cloud providers as well, with some variation. There are three main methods of using Uyuni on a public cloud service. Bring-your-own-subscription (BYOS) Most public cloud providers make a BYOS image of Uyuni available. This means you do not need to install Uyuni, just set up the server or proxy. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin, and there are some additional setup steps required. The public cloud documentation in the Uyuni documentation suite assumes you are using this method. Virtual machine on public cloud In this method, you subscribe to a public cloud service, and install Uyuni in a virtual machine, using the Unified Installer. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. On-demand SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) image Most public cloud providers make SUSE Linux Enterprise Server available as a BYOS image. This means that SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is pre-installed, and you can install Uyuni on top, using the Unified Installer. You can do this by following all the same instructions as you would for any local Uyuni installation. You will need to have SUSE product entitlements before you begin. Be careful with this method, because you might end up requiring additional product entitlements that could drive up your costs. If you are using the BYOS method, start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launching a Uyuni instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Server BYOS images by searching for suse manager. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in 공용 클라우드 요구사항. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Server. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using YaST. When you have completed Uyuni setup, you need to activate the public cloud module. You can then complete the setup in the Uyuni Web UI. You must use the BYOS method. Start by logging in to your chosen public cloud provider, and launch a Uyuni Proxy instance. Depending on the public cloud you are using, you can usually locate the Uyuni Proxy BYOS images by searching for suse manager proxy. In EC2, you need to search within the Community AMIs. In GCE and Azure, search the marketplace. Select a public cloud instance type that meets the hardware and networking requirements in 공용 클라우드 요구사항. When you have your virtual machine ready, and the BYOS image installed, you need to set up Uyuni Proxy. This is done in the same way as a local installation, using SUSE setup tools.

Once the existing subscription term ends, you can purchase Uyuni PAYG via the cloud provider marketplace and manage your instances with a Uyuni deployment that is billed via the cloud. Yes, the listing works independently from your existing BYOS Uyuni subscriptions. Please remember that support processes may be different for deployments using your existing BYOS subscription and those billed via the cloud and note that there is currently no process for migrating deployments between BYOS and PAYG versions. When purchasing Uyuni via the AWS & Azure Marketplaces, the billing is as follows: Billing is monthly and handled via cloud marketplace. Managed instances are recorded hourly. The peak usage total is recorded for the month. There is a monthly usage charge for each instance in the count. SLES for SAP Applications PAYG/on-demand instances, when purchased via the cloud marketplace, include Lifecycle Management(LCM) entitlements for Uyuni. The Uyuni PAYG billing engine recognizes the embedded LCM entitlements and does not include them in the count. This means there are no additional charges to manage these with the Uyuni PAYG listing. However, if Uyuni Monitoring is required for these instances, additional charges will apply for this feature. If using the Uyuni PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace, billing will commence from the time of deployment and when applicable client instances are on-boarded to Uyuni. There is the Uyuni BYOS listing in the cloud marketplace that can be used, a trial subscription key can be obtained via the SUSE Website. This deployment cannot be directly converted to allow billing via cloud marketplaces. To benefit from monthly billing via the cloud marketplace, Uyuni needs to be redeployed using the version from the PAYG listing in the cloud marketplace. Billing is based on the number of managed instances. Below are 3 examples of how the node count is calculated, check the table below for the detail. Static usage Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management, for 1 month with no additional managed clients added in the month. Bursting Model Using Uyuni with 10 instances registered for management for 3 weeks in the month, bursting to 30 managed instances for 1 week. Transient model A temporary deployment of Uyuni with 20 managed instances, for 2 weeks (336 hours) The total is calculated by counting number of active nodes (checked hourly). There is a monthly charge for each managed node under management in the billing cycle. Below are 3 examples of how the average node count is calculated. Table 1. Usage calculations for different scenarios Managed Instances Peak Usage Billed for Static Usage 10 10 10 Bursting Model 10 - 3 Weeks, 30 - 1 Week 30 30 Transient Cluster 20 - 2 Weeks 20 20 It is dependent on the deployment and the cloud provider, as every Cloud Service Provider (CSP) has its own commercial terms and offers. It may be possible to secure special commercial terms such as an annual subscription. For example, AWS can offer Uyuni PAYG via a Private Offer. Please contact SUSE for more information. There are such programs at the cloud providers: Azure MACC Program AWS Enterprise Discount Program Google CUD Yes, it can. Please contact your cloud provider sales team for more details. Once Uyuni PAYG has been deployed from the marketplace listing and billing is active, there is no need to make a specific purchase to manage additional instances. Billing is dynamic and based on the number of instances Uyuni is managing. Just on-board additional instances to Uyuni as needed, this will be reflected in your cloud marketplace bill. By default, the Uyuni PAYG listing on the cloud is billed on a monthly cycle, based on usage. Billing is ongoing for as long as Uyuni is deployed and instances are registered. Currently, there is no volume discount available. If you no longer require support, there are 2 options: Unregister all systems from the Uyuni Server Terminate the Uyuni instance.","title":"Billing - General","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"faq-billing-general","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/faq/faq-billing-general.html","titles":[{"text":"I have an existing Uyuni BYOS subscription; can I use this on the cloud?","hash":"_i_have_an_existing_uyuni_byos_subscription_can_i_use_this_on_the_cloud","id":1},{"text":"I have an existing deployment covered by a BYOS Uyuni subscription; can I use this new listing in the cloud for a separate deployment of Uyuni PAYG?","hash":"_i_have_an_existing_deployment_covered_by_a_byos_uyuni_subscription_can_i_use_this_new_listing_in_the_cloud_for_a_separate_deployment_of_uyuni_payg","id":2},{"text":"Tell me more about how the billing for Uyuni PAYG works via the cloud?","hash":"_tell_me_more_about_how_the_billing_for_uyuni_payg_works_via_the_cloud","id":3},{"text":"I have existing SLES for SAP instances procured via the cloud provider marketplace, is there a cost to manage these instance with Uyuni PAYG?","hash":"_i_have_existing_sles_for_sap_instances_procured_via_the_cloud_provider_marketplace_is_there_a_cost_to_manage_these_instance_with_uyuni_payg","id":4},{"text":"Is there a way to try Uyuni PAYG before purchasing?","hash":"_is_there_a_way_to_try_uyuni_payg_before_purchasing","id":5},{"text":"How does SUSE calculate the amount of managed instances to bill for?","hash":"_how_does_suse_calculate_the_amount_of_managed_instances_to_bill_for","id":6},{"text":"Are special commercial terms available?","hash":"_are_special_commercial_terms_available","id":7},{"text":"Can my spending on Uyuni PAYG count towards my committed spend with the cloud provider?","hash":"_can_my_spending_on_uyuni_payg_count_towards_my_committed_spend_with_the_cloud_provider","id":8},{"text":"How do I purchase Uyuni / LCM subscriptions for additional managed instances?","hash":"_how_do_i_purchase_uyuni_lcm_subscriptions_for_additional_managed_instances","id":9},{"text":"Is this an annual commitment, will it auto-renew?","hash":"_is_this_an_annual_commitment_will_it_auto_renew","id":10},{"text":"Is there a volume discount / tiered pricing built into the Cloud Listing?","hash":"_is_there_a_volume_discount_tiered_pricing_built_into_the_cloud_listing","id":11},{"text":"I no longer require support; how can I end the Uyuni PAYG subscription?","hash":"_i_no_longer_require_support_how_can_i_end_the_uyuni_payg_subscription","id":12}]},"528":{"id":528,"text":"Currently, it is not possible to migrate an existing instance to the PAYG version.

Create a ‘supportconfig’ via Uyuni PAYG instance CLI and upload the output to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) at the following link: https://scc.suse.com/cloudsupport Providing marketplace billing is active, a support case will be opened. The Uyuni PAYG product available in the cloud marketplace is the same product, with similar functionality that you would run on-premises or with a manual installation.

It is also worth checking the list of supported client operating systems to ensure your needs are met. It is recommended that the Uyuni instance always remains active. Uyuni PAYG, when deployed via the cloud marketplace will automatically connect to the SUSE Update Infrastructure, no separate Uyuni subscription key is required. Updates to the Uyuni instance can be applied from those channels using standard SUSE tooling (i.e. zypper). Yes, Uyuni Hub is recommended for customers with more than 10,000 managed clients. If the Uyuni Hub instance has no connected clients, there will be no charge for the Uyuni Hub software components. Billing will occur from the downstream Uyuni PAYG Server instance, where managed instances are connected. To manage BYOS instances, SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Yes, it is possible to manage instances, in the cloud, on premises or both. To enable management of SUSE workloads in an on-premises data center, SCC credentials with entitlement to valid SLES or SLES for SAP subscriptions will be required. These credentials should be added to the Uyuni configuration to enable this functionality. Egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider's network. With a hybrid landscape, egress data charges may apply when managing workloads outside of the cloud provider. To reduce these costs, SUSE recommend the use of the containerized proxy. Please note: Whilst the SUSE Manger Proxy usage is included as part of the Uyuni PAYG subscription, an LCM+ subscription will be billed if the proxy is also a managed workload, so in other words it counted as a managed client. No, to benefit from cloud marketplace billing, the Uyuni PAYG instance must reside on the cloud. Any Uyuni instances on premises will require their own subscriptions.

There are two tabs you need to fill out: Basics and Virtual Machine Settings. Project Details As with every resource in Azure, you need to provide a Resource Group (RG). This can be an existing RG or you can create a new RG for this deployment. Instance Details Region – where the instance should run. Virtual Machine Name – the name of the VM in which Uyuni will run. Username – the administrator account for the Uyuni VM. SSH Key Source and Key – needed to access the machine. We do not allow the use of a password here. This is to reduce the risk of brute force attacks. Managed Application Details Application Name – the name of the Managed Application. Managed Resource Group (MRG) – where the Uyuni VM and its resources will be deployed into. Instance Size The default for the instance size is D8as v5, which is a good baseline for a production server. It provides enough resources for more data disks and IOPS throughput for disk and network. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dasv5-dadsv5-series If you only need a test instance, you can go smaller and choose an instance size with 4 vCPUs and 16GB memory or use a B-Series (Burstable) instance with a similar configuration. Diagnostic Storage Account If you normally create a VM in the Azure portal, boot diagnostics are enabled by default using a managed storage account. You can choose an existing storage account or create a new one (default). OS Disk Size This is the root disk of the Uyuni installation, which holds: The OS and the Uyuni application. /var/cache – where you need to provide storage space for each product you want to manage. The proposed default of 100GB should be accepted. Database Disk Size This holds the Database for Uyuni and needs a minimum of 50GB. The proposed value of 80GB is a good default suggestion. Spacewalk Disk Size This holds the package repositories and should have at least 100GB. Additional requirements include: 50GB for every SUSE product. >360GB for every RedHat or other Linux product. The proposed default of 500GB is a safe default to start with. Repository synchronization will fail if this directory runs out of disk space. Public IP Address for the VM By default, a Public IP Address is created to access the Uyuni VM and Application. If you use it, please ensure this is secure and access is limited. Running Uyuni on the public cloud means implementing robust security measures. It is essential to limit, filter, monitor, and audit access to the instance. SUSE strongly advises against a globally accessible Uyuni instance that lacks adequate perimeter security. You should carefully consider this, as the Uyuni Server will have access to all managed nodes. If someone gains access to Uyuni, it would mean access to all managed nodes as well. Threat actors actively scan for accessible machines with open management ports (e.g., SSH or RDP), especially on cloud providers. A Network Security Group (NSG) is created by default if you choose to create a Public IP. It only allows inbound SSH access via port 22 as a minimal protection for the public IP. It is recommended to additionally restrict access to a defined list of networks and allow Azure’s virtual network to drop requests originating from other networks. Furthermore, you can add Just-in-Time access and/or use the Azure Bastion Service, Firewall, VPN, or private network methods to secure public access. You can choose not to create a Public IP address (which is more secure), but you will need to use other methods to access the created Uyuni VM and its Web UI for further configuration. Additionally, you must take care of the DNS and ensure a correct FQDN. DNS Prefix for the Public IP Address The Uyuni server must resolve its FQDN correctly. If the FQDN cannot be resolved, it can cause issues in several Uyuni components. To ensure that the Uyuni domain name can be resolved by its clients, both server and client machines must be connected to a working DNS server. You also need to ensure that reverse lookups are correctly configured. If you use the Public IP address, a DNS name is automatically created from Azure. You only need to ensure that a unique name is used. The default suggestion creates one by including a random number to make the domain name unique. If you do not use the Public IP, you need to make sure that your setup can resolve the FQDN correctly as mentioned above. Virtual Network / Subnet You will see a default proposal for a virtual network where Uyuni will reside. By clicking edit, you can adjust it to your needs. Remember that a Managed Application will be deployed from SUSE to your Azure tenant. Therefore, this network is the network in the Managed Resource Group (MRG) and cannot overlap with existing networks. At a later stage, you need to peer this network to the network with the nodes you want to manage. Alternatively, you can create the managed nodes within this network. With all fields filled out, press Next or Create. The Azure portal will perform a final check and provide a summary screen of this deployment. If everything is correct, press Create to deploy the Managed Application for Uyuni. After the VM is deployed, you can access it via SSH. Usage and Costs Keep in mind that since this is a PAYG image, you will be billed according to your actual usage, including the number of systems you manage and monitor with this instance. It’s essential to regularly track and review your usage to prevent unexpected costs and ensure alignment with your needs.","title":"Initial Preparation and Configuration of the Microsoft Azure Managed Application","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"payg-azure-configure-the-image","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/public-cloud-guide/payg/azure/payg-azure-configure-the-image.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Firstly, log in to your Azure account, via https://portal.azure.com This makes sure that the Azure system is able to identify in which country your account get billed. It is important, as billing for Uyuni PAYG is handled via the Azure Marketplace. As there are restrictions on which countries this listing can be billed, the account you will transact to should be the one you are logged into. There are currently two offers for Uyuni PAYG on Microsoft Azure: Uyuni 2025.10 with 24x7 Support (EMEA Orders only) Uyuni 2025.10 with 24x7 Support Pick the listing that reflects in which country your Azure account gets billed. It depends on the sold to address of the account, see https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/change-azure-account-profile. Do not go directly to the Azure Marketplace and get the offer. Even if the offers are visible, they should not be selected from here, as the Azure Web page is not able to identify your billing account. Always log into the portal first After you are logged into the Azure Portal, click Create a resource. Enter Uyuni 2025.10 into the search field on the top and press RETURN You get a list of offerings and need to select the version of Uyuni 2025.10 with 24x7 Support depending on your billing country.

Azure has created the Managed Application offering for this use case. For more information, see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/managed-applications/overview. Figure 1. Architecture Diagram of a managed application This resource group ( in the diagram ResGroup A ) holds the managed application instance, which could be translated as the metadata or definition of the offering. It can only contain a single resource. A customer has full access to the resource group and uses it to manage the life cycle of the managed application. This resource group ( in the diagram MRG ) holds all the resources that are required by the managed application. For example, an application’s virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks. A managed application is similar to a solution template in Azure Marketplace, with a few key differences: The resources are deployed into a managed resource group that is normally managed by the application’s publisher. It is present in the customer’s subscription, but an identity in the publisher’s tenant can be given access to the managed resource group. The publisher’s management access and the customers deny assignment are optional. There are different permission scenarios available. SUSE is using here the Customer managed to give our customers of SUSE Manager full control. Customer managed Customer Customer has full access to the solution (in the managed resource group) The customer manages the solution Publisher The publisher has no access to manage the solution. The publisher develops the application and publishes on Azure Marketplace but does not manage the application. The publisher licenses the application for billing through Azure Marketplace. When setting up a Uyuni PAYG instance on Microsoft Azure, it’s essential to consider system requirements for optimal performance and functionality. The default requirements outlined below have been tailored for smooth deployment and operation. By default, certain disks are automatically generated when establishing a Uyuni PAYG instance on Microsoft Azure. To complete the setup of these disks, use the mgr-storage-server tool. Table 1.

To get the details, click on the name of the virtual machine. Here you can see the (public) IP address which you need to connect to the running instance. SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system . sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Remember, the Uyuni PAYG setup requires, that a new Virtual Network and a new subnet is configured, which was performed in the previous step. Because Uyuni PAYG is deployed as a 'Managed Application' it is not possible to deploy into an existing network. Before moving on to the next step, ensure the network is correctly configured: When you setup new clients which should be managed, take care that you put them into the private subnet which is configured with Uyuni PAYG or peer your networks. If you want to manage systems in an already existing network, you must configure peering. For more information, see Azure documentation. Procedure: Network Configuration Ensure the network configuration aligns such that hostname -f yields the identical name as the reverse DNS lookup of the private IP address. For instance, when executing nslookup 10.0.0.X. Insert the private IP with its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) into /etc/hosts. For example: 10.0.0.4 instancename.location.internal.cloudapp.azure.com Edit /etc/sysconfig/network/config and append internal.cloudapp.azure.com to NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST. Execute netconfig update. Subsequently, hostname -f should return the same FQDN as obtained from nslookup 10.0.0.X. When adding new virtual machines (VMs), such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, it’s crucial to ensure that they are configured within the same subnet as the Uyuni instance, or that you have setup network peering. This step is essential for successful network setup and integration. Additionally, be mindful of the geographical restrictions associated with your plans. Make sure to utilize the appropriate Azure accounts which correspond to the specific geographic zones of your project. Procedure: Configuring Storage SSH into your Microsoft Azure instance. Switch to the root user and update the system: sudo -i transactional-update Reboot the system. Configure storage using the appropriate tool: For a standard setup, use mgr-storage-server. For a proxy configuration, use mgr-storage-proxy. For more details, run: mgr-storage-server --help mgr-storage-proxy --help These tools simplify the creation of container storage and database volumes. Identify the block devices: ls /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/ This command lists the disks created during deployment. Typically: lun3 is the storage disk. lun4 is the database disk. Configure storage using the identified devices: mgr-storage-server /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun3 /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun4 This command creates persistent storage volumes at: /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes For more details, see Persistent Container Volumes.

An in-place migration from SUSE Manager 4.3 to 2025.10 is not supported, regardless of whether the chosen host operating system is SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7. Before migrating from SUSE Manager 4.3 to 2025.10, any existing traditional clients including the traditional proxies must be migrated to Salt. For more information about migrating traditional Uyuni 4.3 clients to Salt clients, see https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/contact-methods-migrate-traditional.html. Traditional contact protocol is no longer supported in Uyuni 5.0 and later. Before migrating a SUSE Manager 4.3 Proxy to Uyuni 2025.10, the SUSE Manager 4.3 Server needs to be migrated first, see Uyuni Server Migration to a Containerized Environment. In Uyuni 4.3, the proxy can be deployed using three different methods: RPM based containerized running on Podman containerized running on k3s In Uyuni 2025.10, RPM based support was removed, and only the containerized version running with podman or k3s is supported. Furthermore, the management of the containerized proxy running with Podman was re-designed and made simpler with the mgrpxy tool. Because an in-place migration is not supported, a deployment of a new Uyuni proxy with a new FQDN is required. For more information on deploying a new proxy on SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 see Install Uyuni Proxy . Before migrating the clients, ensure that the new Uyuni 2025.10 Proxy is already deployed and fully functional.

All selected clients will now be migrated to the new proxy. You can check the schedule progress to verify if all clients were successfully migrated. After a few minutes, the clients will start to show the new connection path. When all clients have the connection path under the new proxy, the old SUSE Manager 4.3 Proxy system is not needed anymore and can be removed. Containerized proxies do not use tftpsync mechanism to transfer tftproot files. Instead these files are transparently downloaded and cached on demand. To prevent false positive errors during cobbler sync run, migrated 4.3 proxies need to be removed from tftpsync mechanism.

Migrating an existing Uyuni 2025.10 instance to the same version while switching the host operating system from SL Micro 6.1 to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7, or vice versa, is not handled by the mgradm migrate command. Current migration procedure does not include functionality for renaming hostnames. As a result, fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the new server will remain the same as that of the old server. The IP address must remain unchanged to ensure that the clients can contact the server. After the migration, it is necessary to manually update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. Self-trusted GPG keys are not migrated. GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated. Thus, synchronizing channels with spacewalk-repo-sync can fail. 관리자는 실제 서버 마이그레이션을 수행한 후 이러한 키를 4.3 설치에서 컨테이너 호스트로 수동으로 마이그레이션해야 합니다.

SSL certificates are needed at a later stage. If not using the self-signed generated CA and certificates, ensure you have the following before starting: A certificate authority (CA) SSL public certificate. If you are using a CA chain, all intermediate CAs must also be available. An SSL database private key. An SSL database certificate. All files must be in PEM format. The hostname of the SSL server certificate must match the fully qualified hostname of the machine you deploy them on. You can set the hostnames in the X509v3 Subject Alternative Name section of the certificate. You can also list multiple hostnames if your environment requires it. Supported Key types are RSA and EC (Elliptic Curve). Database SSL certificate requires reportdb and db and the FQDN used to access the report database as Subject Alternative Name. During a migration the server SSL certificate and CA chain are copied from the source server, meaning that only the database certificates are required Do not pre-install Uyuni on the prepared SL Micro 6.1 or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP7 system. The migration process is designed to perform the server installation automatically. Running mgradm install and then mgradm migrate is not supported and will lead to an unsupported system state.

In the screen Extensions and Modules Selection check the following: Select the Uyuni Server Extension to install the Server, or the Uyuni Proxy Extension to install the Proxy. Basesystem Module Containers Module 다음을 클릭하여 계속합니다. Enter your Uyuni 2025.10 extension registration code. 다음을 클릭하여 계속합니다. 설치를 완료합니다. When the installation completes, log in to the newly installed server as root. Update the System (optional, if the system was not set to download updates during install): zypper up 재부팅합니다. If you added Uyuni 2025.10 as an extension during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation then you can skip this procedure. However, optionally you may skip registration during SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation by selecting the Skip Registration button. This section provides steps on registering your products after SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation. The following steps register a Uyuni 2025.10 extension with the x86-64 architecture and thus require a registration code for the x86-64 architecture. To register ARM or s390x architectures use the correct registration code. Procedure: Registering from the command line List available extensions with the following command: SUSEConnect --list-extensions From the list of available extensions, select the one you wish to install. If installing the Server, use your Uyuni Server Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code. For example for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP7, use the following commands: SUSEConnect -r <regcode> SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.7/x86_64 SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Server-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> If installing the Proxy, use your Uyuni Proxy Extension 2025.10 x86_64 registration code with the following command: SUSEConnect -p Multi-Linux-Manager-Proxy-SLE/5.1/x86_64 -r <regcode> Procedure: Installing podman Log in as root and install podman plus, on the server, mgradm and mgradm-bash-completion or, on the proxies, mgrpxy and mgrpxy-bash-completion (if not already automatically installed): On the server: zypper install podman mgradm mgradm-bash-completion On the proxies: zypper install podman mgrpxy mgrpxy-bash-completion Start the Podman service by rebooting the system, or running a command: systemctl enable --now podman.service This step ensures that the new Uyuni 2025.10 Server can connect to the existing 4.3 Server over SSH without requiring a password. It involves generating and configuring SSH keys, setting up an SSH agent, and copying the public key to the old server. This setup is required for the migration process to run without manual intervention. 절차: SSH 연결 준비 새 2025.10 서버에 root에 대한 SSH 키가 있는지 확인합니다. 키가 없는 경우 다음을 사용하여 키를 만듭니다. ssh-keygen -t rsa The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server for a connection to the 4.3 server that does not prompt for a password. eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add To establish a connection that does not prompt for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server. If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add followed by the path to the private key. You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. ssh-copy-id를 사용하여 Uyuni 4.3 서버(<oldserver.fqdn>)에 공개 SSH 키를 복사합니다. <oldserver.fqdn>을 4.3 서버의 FQDN으로 바꿉니다. ssh-copy-id <old server.fqdn> The SSH key will be copied into the old server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. For more information, see the ssh-copy-id manpage. 새 서버에서 기존 Uyuni 서버로 SSH 연결을 설정하여 비밀번호가 필요하지 않은지 확인합니다. 호스트 지문에도 문제가 없어야 합니다. 문제가 있는 경우 ~/.ssh/known_hosts 파일에서 기존 지문을 제거합니다. 그런 다음 다시 시도합니다. 지문은 로컬 ~/.ssh/known_hosts 파일에 저장됩니다. When planning your migration from SUSE Manager 4.3 to Uyuni 2025.10, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the old setup. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth. Uyuni server hosts that are hardened for security may restrict execution of files from the /tmp folder. In such cases, as a workaround, export the TMPDIR environment variable to another existing path before running mgradm. 예: export TMPDIR=/path/to/other/tmp In Uyuni updates, tools will be changed to make this workaround unnecessary. When migrating from SUSE Manager 4.3, you will be prompted for the Password for the CA key to generate. It is essential to enter the same CA password that was used in your SUSE Manager 4.3 installation. Entering the wrong password will result in a failure to generate the database certificate and will cause the migration to abort with the following error: Error: cannot configure db container: Cannot generate database certificate: CA validation failed! Make sure the correct CA password is available before starting the migration process. Procedure: Performing the migration This step is optional. If custom persistent storage is required for your infrastructure, use the mgr-storage-server tool. For more information about mgr-storage-server, see installation-and-upgrade:hardware-requirements.adoc#install-hardware-requirements-storage. Execute the following command to migrate and set up a new Uyuni 2025.10 server. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the 4.3 server: Make sure to upgrade your 4.3 server and apply all available updates before starting the migration process. Additionally, remove any unnecessary channels to help reduce the overall migration time. The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the old 4.3 server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration, the processes on the old 4.3 server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping of services on the old 4.3 server. mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare Procedure: Final migration Stop the SUSE Manager services on 4.3 Server: spacewalk-service stop Stop the PostgreSQL service on 4.3 Server: systemctl stop postgresql Perform the final migration on Uyuni 2025.10 Server mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 신뢰할 수 있는 SSL CA 인증서를 마이그레이션합니다. Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on Uyuni 4.3 in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the SUSE Manager 4.3 server after the migration. Procedure: Migrating the certificates Copy the file from the SUSE Manager 4.3 Server to the new Uyuni 2025.10 Server. 예를 들어 /local/ca.file일 수 있습니다. 다음을 사용하여 파일을 컨테이너에 복사합니다. mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ mgradm migrate 명령을 성공적으로 실행한 후에도 모든 클라이언트의 Salt 설정은 계속해서 기존 4.3 서버를 가리킵니다. To redirect them to the 2025.10 server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as 4.3 server. Adjusting the IP address can be avoided if the latest version of the minion is installed on the clients, as the newer version can automatically re-connect with the server using only the FQDN. Uyuni 2025.10 introduces a rebranded set of client tools for all supported operating systems. This transition is seamless, and users performing a new product synchronization should only notice the updated channel names. Channels named SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ, used by clients previously registered with Uyuni 4.3 or 5.0, are no longer available in version 5.1 and will no longer receive updates in 5.1. Although the legacy channels remain assigned to existing clients after migration, the corresponding repositories have been removed. To ensure continued updates, users must: Mirror the new SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels for the relevant products and assign them to the appropriate clients. Unassign the outdated SUSE Manager Client Tools for XYZ channels. This also means that any CLM projects based on the old client tools must be adjusted accordingly. For example workflow, see Switch to new client tools channels.","title":"Uyuni Server Migration to a Containerized Environment","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"server-mlm-43-51","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/container-deployment/mlm/migrations/server/server-mlm-43-51.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
