Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice. Include an unaltered copy of this License. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.

Highstate: highstate를 실행합니다. 사용자 정의 상태: 일련의 사용자 정의 상태를 실행합니다. 사용자 정의 상태는 Uyuni에서 제공되는 내부 상태이거나 사용자가 생성한 구성 채널일 수 있습니다. 구성 채널에 대한 자세한 내용은 구성 관리에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 새 정기적 작업 생성하기 개별 클라이언트에 정기적 작업을 적용하려면 시스템으로 이동하여 일정을 구성할 클라이언트를 클릭하고 정기적 작업 탭으로 이동합니다. 시스템 그룹에 정기적 작업을 적용하려면 시스템 시스템 그룹으로 이동하여 일정을 구성할 그룹을 선택한 후 정기적 작업 탭으로 이동합니다. 생성을 클릭합니다. 작업 유형 드롭다운에서 작업 유형을 선택합니다. 새 일정의 이름을 입력합니다. 정기적 작업 빈도를 선택합니다. 매시간: 각 시간의 분을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 15는 매시 15분에 작업을 실행합니다. 매일: 매일의 시간을 선택합니다. 예를 들어, 01:00은 Uyuni 서버의 시간대에서 매일 0100시에 작업을 실행합니다. 매주: 매주 지정된 시간에 작업을 실행할 요일과 시간을 선택합니다. 매월: 매월 지정된 시간에 작업을 실행할 날짜와 시간을 선택합니다. 사용자 정의 Quartz 형식: 자세한 옵션을 보려면 사용자 정의 Quartz 스트링을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 매월 토요일 0215에 정기적 작업을 실행하려면 다음을 입력합니다. 0 15 2 ? * 7 선택 사항: 테스트 모드에서 일정을 실행하려면 테스트 모드 스위치를 토글합니다. 사용자 정의 상태 유형의 작업일 경우 사용 가능한 상태 목록에서 상태를 선택하고 변경사항 저장을 클릭합니다. 그러면 일정이 아닌 선택한 현재 상태만 저장됩니다. 다음 패널에서 선택한 상태를 드래그 앤 드롭하여 실행 순서에 넣고 확인을 클릭합니다. 일정 생성을 클릭하여 저장하고 기존 일정의 전체 목록을 확인합니다. 조직 관리자는 조직의 모든 클라이언트에 대한 정기적 작업을 설정하고 편집할 수 있습니다. 홈 내 조직 정기적 상태로 이동하면 조직 전체에 적용되는 모든 반복 작업을 확인 가능합니다. Uyuni 관리자는 모든 조직의 모든 클라이언트에 대한 정기적 작업을 설정하고 편집할 수 있습니다. 관리 조직으로 이동하여 관리할 조직을 선택한 후 상태 정기적 작업 탭으로 이동하면 됩니다. 클라이언트에서 순차 작업을 여러 개 수행해야 하는 경우 작업 체인을 생성하면 순서대로 작업할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 대부분의 클라이언트는 명령하는 즉시 작업을 실행합니다. 일부 경우에는 작업에 시간이 오래 걸리므로 이후에 실행된 작업이 실패할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 클라이언트에 재부팅을 명령한 후 두 번째 명령을 실행하면 재부팅이 아직 수행 중이므로 두 번째 작업이 실패할 수 있습니다. 작업이 올바른 순서로 발생하도록 하려면 작업 체인을 사용하십시오. 트랜잭션 업데이트 시스템의 경우 재부팅 작업이 남을 때까지 단일 스냅샷 내에서 작업 체인이 실행됩니다. 이로 인해 일부 제한이 발생할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 SLE Micro 클라이언트 등록 및 openSUSE Leap Micro 클라이언트 등록에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 모든 클라이언트에서 작업 체인을 사용할 수 있습니다. 작업 체인에는 다음과 같이 이러한 작업을 원하는 수만큼, 원하는 순서대로 포함할 수 있습니다. 시스템 세부 사항 원격 명령 시스템 세부 사항 시스템 재부팅 예약 시스템 세부 사항 상태 Highstate 시스템 세부 사항 소프트웨어 패키지 목록/제거 시스템 세부 사항 소프트웨어 패키지 설치 시스템 세부 사항 소프트웨어 패키지 업그레이드 시스템 세부 사항 소프트웨어 패치 시스템 세부 사항 소프트웨어 소프트웨어 채널 시스템 세부 사항 구성 이미지 빌드 Action chains are user-specific.

For each system, the Actions column provides information about what you need to do to address vulnerabilities. If applicable, a list of candidate channels or patches is also given. You can also assign systems to a System Set for further batch processing. Uyuni API를 사용하여 클라이언트의 패치 상태를 확인할 수 있습니다. audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus API 메소드를 사용하면 됩니다. 이 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 Uyuni API 가이드에서 확인할 수 있습니다. In addition to retrieving CVE information from channel data, Uyuni now includes an experimental feature that fetches CVE details from OVAL files. This functionality is currently considered a Technology Preview. Users are encouraged to experiment with this feature and share feedback. However, it is not yet recommended for production use without thorough testing in a test environment. The CVE Audit operation relies on two primary data sources: channels and OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language). These two sources provide the metadata for conducting CVE audits, each serving a distinct purpose. 채널 Channels include the updated software packages, including the patches, and provide insights into the essential patches required to address vulnerabilities. OVAL (Technology Preview) In contrast, OVAL data supply the information about vulnerabilities themselves, and packages that render a system vulnerable to a CVE. While it is possible to conduct CVE audits using only channels data, synchronizing OVAL data enhances the accuracy of the results, particularly in cases involving zero-day vulnerabilities or partially patched vulnerabilities. OVAL data is much more lightweight than channels data. For example, OVAL data for openSUSE Leap 15.4 is around 50 MB. Having synced OVAL data only, you can already perform CVE audits and check if your systems are vulnerable or not to a CVE, but you can’t apply patches since they come from channels. Key characteristics of the OVAL feature include: Disabled by default: The feature is turned off by default and must be explicitly enabled by the user by updating the configuration file rhn.conf and restarting relevant services. Reversible: If any issues arise, users can revert back to the standard channel-based CVE audit. Performance considerations: While initial testing has been conducted, there are still concerns regarding performance, and further optimizations may be needed. OVAL data is updated at 23:00 every day by default. We recommend that before you begin a CVE audit you refresh the data to ensure you have the latest vulnerabilities metadata. Procedure: Enabling OVAL Data Support Add or modify the following setting in rhn.conf: java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=true Restart the Tomcat and Taskomatic services: systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic If you encounter issues and need to revert to the default behavior, disable the feature by setting: Procedure: Disabling OVAL Data Support Add or modify the following setting in rhn.conf: java.cve_audit.enable_oval_metadata=false Restart the Tomcat and Taskomatic services: systemctl restart tomcat taskomatic Procedure: Updating OVAL Data In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Task Schedules and select the oval-data-sync-default schedule. Click oval-data-sync-bunch. 단일 실행 일정을 클릭하여 작업을 예약합니다. 작업을 완료한 후 CVE 감사를 계속 진행합니다. To be able to accurately identify what vulnerabilities apply to a certain client, we need to identify the operating system product that client uses. To do that, we collect the CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) of the client as a salt grain, then we save it to the database. The CPE of newly registered clients will be automatically collected and saved to the database. However, for existing clients, it is necessary to execute the Update Packages List action at least once. Procedure: Update Packages List In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System List All and select a client. Then go to the Software tab and select the Packages sub-tab. Click Update Packages List to update packages and collect the CPE of client. To ensure the integrity and currency of the OVAL data, Uyuni exclusively consumes OVAL data from the official maintainers of every product. Below, you can find the list of OVAL data sources. Table 1. OVAL Sources Product Source URL openSUSE Leap https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval openSUSE Leap Micro SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro RedHat Enterprise Linux https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/v2 Debian https://www.debian.org/security/oval Ubuntu https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval OVAL metadata is used in CVE auditing for only a subset of clients, namely, clients that use openSUSE Leap, SUSE enterprise products, RHEL, Debian or Ubuntu. This is due to the absence of OVAL vulnerability definitions metadata for the other products. 클라이언트의 CVE 상태는 일반적으로 영향을 받음, 영향을 받지 않음 또는 패치됨입니다. 이러한 상태는 Uyuni에서 사용할 수 있는 정보만으로 결정됩니다. Uyuni 내에서 이러한 정의가 적용되는 대상은 다음과 같습니다. 특정 취약점의 영향을 받는 시스템 취약점으로 표시된 관련 패치의 패키지 버전보다 낮은 버전의 패키지가 설치된 시스템입니다. 특정 취약점의 영향을 받지 않는 시스템 취약점으로 표시된 관련 패치에도 있는 설치된 패키지가 설치되지 않은 시스템입니다. 특정 취약점에 대해 패치된 시스템 취약점으로 표시된 관련 패치와 동일한 패키지 버전 이상의 패키지가 설치된 시스템입니다. 관련 패치 관련 채널에서 Uyuni가 알려진 패치입니다. 관련 채널 Uyuni에서 관리하는 채널로, 시스템에 할당된 채널, 시스템에 할당된 복제된 채널의 원본, 시스템에 설치된 제품에 연결된 채널 또는 시스템에 대한 과거 또는 미래의 서비스 팩 채널입니다. Uyuni 내에서 사용된 정의로 인해 일부 상황에서는 CVE 감사 결과가 정확하지 않을 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 관리되지 않는 채널, 관리되지 않는 패키지 또는 미준수 시스템은 잘못 보고할 수 있습니다.","title":"감사","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"auditing","url":"/uyuni/administration/auditing.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Because Uyuni relies on a database as well as the installed program and configurations, it is important to back up all components of your installation. Back up your Uyuni installation regularly to prevent data loss and enable quick recovery. 백업 방법과 관계없이 현재 설치 작업 중 사용하는 공간의 세 배 이상을 사용할 수 있어야 합니다. 공간이 부족하면 백업이 실패할 수 있으므로 수시로 확인하십시오. smdba backup tool is deprecated in Uyuni. The most comprehensive method for backing up your Uyuni installation is to use mgradm backup create command. This can save you time in administering your backup, and can be faster to reinstall and re-synchronize in the case of failure. However, this method requires significant disk space and could take a long time to perform the backup. mgradm backup create command performs backup to a directory. This directory can be both local or mounted remote storage. mgradm backup create command allows various customizations of the content of the backup. For all available options, see mgradm backup create --help. A full backup of the Uyuni consists of backing up the following components: Uyuni volumes database volumes podman network configuration podman secrets Uyuni systemd services Uyuni container images The Uyuni service is automatically stopped during creation of a full backup. Procedure: Creating Full Backup with mgradm backup create On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. mgradm backup create tool allows creating partial backups. It is possible to skip individual or all volumes, skip database backup and images. Particularly when database backup is skipped, backup is created without stopping Uyuni services and can act as a one phase in two phase backup procedure. Partial backup cannot guarantee backup/restore consistency. Procedure: Creating Partial Backup by Skipping Database Backup On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create --skipdatabase $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Procedure: Creating Partial Backup by Skipping a Volume. On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create --skipvolumes $volumes $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Replace $volumes by the name of the volume name to be included in the backup, or by a comma separated list of volumes to be included. Use all to skip all volumes, except database volumes. mgradm backup command uses internal list of Uyuni volumes. If additional volumes were configured during the installation, or additional volumes should be added to the backup, they need to be specified using --extravolumes $volumes. Procedure: Creating Backup with Additional Custom Volume On the container host, as root, create backup with: mgradm backup create --extravolumes $volume $path Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Replace $volumes by the name of the volume name to be included in the backup. or by a comma separated list of volumes to be included. 절차: 수동 데이터베이스 백업 수행 Allocate permanent storage space for your backup. At the command prompt of the Uyuni container host, as root, use: mgradm backup create --skipvolumes all --skipconfig --skipimages $path Restoring Uyuni from the existing backup will enumerate backup for volumes, images and configuration to restore. Unlike in backup create scenario, restore operation is not using an internal volume list, but automatically detect every volume or image present in the backup. After the list of items to restore is gathered, presence and integrity check is performed. Presence check ensures backup restore will not accidentally overwrite existing volumes, image or configurations. Integrity check is done by computing backup items checksums. After both checks are successful, actual backup restore is performed. Uyuni services are not automatically started after backup restore is finished. Procedure: Restoring from an Existing Backup On the container host, as root, re-deploy the Uyuni Server with: mgradm backup restore $path mgradm start Replace $path by the path to the backup location. Verification of the backup can be a time-consuming operation. If backup integrity is ensured by other means, verification can be skipped by using --skipverify option. If for some reason it is needed to skip restoring a volume present in the backup, --skipvolumes $volumes option can be used.

CLM 프로젝트에서 AppStream 필터가 한 개 이상 활성화되어 있으면 모든 대상 리포지토리가 일반 리포지토리로 변환됩니다. 일부 경우 모듈의 패키지를 포함하지 않고 일반 리포지토리를 구축하는 것이 가능합니다. 이를 위해서는 선택기 none (disable moduleity)를 사용하여 AppStream 필터를 추가하십시오. 그러면 대상 리포지토리의 모든 모듈이 비활성화됩니다. 이것은 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 클라이언트에 특히 유용합니다. 대부분의 모듈의 기본 버전은 AppStream 리포지토리에 일반 패키지로 이미 포함되어 있습니다. AppStream 필터를 사용하려면 Red Hat Enterprise Linux AppStreams와 같은 모듈형 리포지토리가 있는 CLM 프로젝트가 필요합니다. 시작하기 전에 필요한 모듈을 소스로 포함했는지 확인합니다. 절차: AppStream 필터 사용 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 또는 9 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 같음을 선택합니다. 모듈 이름 필드에 모듈 이름을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, postgresql입니다. 스트림 필드에 원하는 스트림의 이름을 입력합니다. 예를 들어, 10입니다. 이 필드를 비워 두면 모듈의 기본 스트림이 선택됩니다. 새 필터를 생성하려면 저장을 클릭합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭하고 새 AppStream 필터를 선택한 후 저장을 클릭합니다. 필터 생성/편집 양식의 찾아보기 기능을 사용하여 모듈형 채널을 위해 사용할 수 있는 모듈 스트림 목록에서 모듈을 선택할 수 있습니다. 절차: 사용 가능한 모듈 스트림 찾아보기 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 또는 9 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 같음을 선택합니다. 모든 모듈형 채널을 보려면 사용 가능한 모듈 찾아보기를 클릭합니다. 모듈 및 스트림을 탐색할 채널을 선택합니다. 모듈 이름 필드에서 검색할 모듈 이름을 입력하거나 목록에서 선택합니다. 스트림 필드에서 검색할 스트림 이름을 입력하거나 목록에서 선택합니다. 채널 선택은 모듈 탐색을 위해서만 사용할 수 있습니다. 선택한 채널은 필터와 함께 저장되지 않으며 어떠한 방식으로도 CLM 프로세스에 영향을 미치지 않습니다. 대상 리포지토리에 포함할 다른 모듈 스트림에 대한 추가 AppStream 필터를 생성할 수 있습니다. 선택한 스트림이 활용하는 모든 모듈 스트림이 자동으로 포함됩니다. 충돌하거나 호환되지 않거나 누락된 모듈 스트림을 지정하지 않도록 주의하십시오. 예를 들어, 동일한 모듈에서 스트림을 두 개 선택하는 것은 적절하지 않습니다. 절차: 모듈성 활성화 Uyuni Web UI에서 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 또는 9 CLM 프로젝트로 이동합니다. 프로젝트에 AppStream 채널을 포함했는지 확인합니다. 필터 생성을 클릭하고 다음 파라미터를 사용합니다. 필터 이름 필드에 새 필터의 이름을 입력합니다. 필터 유형 필드에서 모듈(스트림)을 선택합니다. 선택기 필드에서 없음(모듈성 비활성화)을 선택합니다. 새 필터를 생성하려면 저장을 클릭합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭하고 새 AppStream 필터를 선택한 후 저장을 클릭합니다. 이 작업을 수행하면 대상 리포지토리에서 모듈 메타데이터가 효과적으로 제거됩니다. 단, 모듈에 속한 패키지는 제외입니다. Web UI에서 빌드 버튼을 사용하여 CLM 프로젝트를 빌드할 때 대상 리포지토리는 선택한 모듈 스트림의 패키지를 포함하는 모듈이 포함되지 않은 일반 리포지토리입니다. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 프로젝트에서 모듈성을 모두 비활성화하면 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8이 정상적으로 작동하려면 일부 모듈이 필수적이므로 잘못된 환경이 구성할 수 있습니다.","title":"컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리 예제","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle-examples","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle-examples.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 월간 패치 주기에 대한 프로젝트 생성","hash":"create-proj-for-patch-cycle","id":1},{"text":"1.1. 날짜 기준 필터 생성","hash":"create-a-filter","id":2},{"text":"1.2. 프로젝트에 필터 추가","hash":"add-filter-to-proj","id":3},{"text":"1.3. 새 프로젝트 빌드에 필터 적용","hash":"apply-filter-to-project-build","id":4},{"text":"1.4. 프로젝트에서 패치 제외","hash":"exclude-a-patch","id":5},{"text":"1.5. 프로젝트에 패치 포함","hash":"include-a-patch","id":6},{"text":"2. 기존 월간 패치 주기 업데이트","hash":"update-a-patch-cycle","id":7},{"text":"3. 라이브 패치로 프로젝트 향상","hash":"enhance-project-with-livepatching","id":8},{"text":"3.1. 상위 커널 버전 패키지 제외","hash":"exclude-higher-kernel-version","id":9},{"text":"4. 라이브 패치를 위한 새 커널 버전으로 전환","hash":"switch-kernel-version-for-live-patching","id":10},{"text":"5.

Uyuni를 사용하면 다양한 유형의 필터를 생성하여 프로젝트 빌드에 사용되는 컨텐트를 제어할 수 있습니다. 필터를 사용하면 빌드에 포함되거나 제외되는 패키지를 선택할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 모든 커널 패키지를 제외하거나 일부 패키지의 특정 릴리스만 포함할 수 있습니다. 지원되는 필터: 패키지 필터링 이름 기준 이름, 에포크, 버전, 릴리스 및 아키텍처 기준 제공 이름 기준 패치 필터링 권고 이름 기준 권고 유형 기준 시놉시스 기준 키워드 기준 날짜 기준 영향을 받는 패키지 기준 모듈 스트림 기준 컨텐트 필터링 중에는 패키지 종속성이 해결되지 않습니다. 필터와 함께 사용할 수 있는 여러 선택기가 있습니다. 사용 가능한 필터 유형은 선택한 필터 유형에 따라 다릅니다. 사용할 수 있는 선택기: 포함 일치(정규식 형식이어야 함) 같음 큼 크거나 같음 작거나 같음 작음 이상 각 필터에는 허용 또는 거부로 설정할 수 있는 규칙 파라미터가 있습니다. 필터는 다음과 같이 처리됩니다. 패키지 또는 패치가 거부 필터를 충족하면 결과에서 제외됩니다. 패키지 또는 패치가 허용 필터를 만족하는 경우, 해당 항목은 결과에 포함됩니다(거부 필터에 의해 제외된 경우에도 동일). 패키지에 대한 허용 필터는 패키지 필터에서만 작동하고, 패치에 대한 허용 필터는 패치 필터에서만 작동합니다. 즉, 패키지 필터를 사용하면 패치 필터를 통해 필터링된 패키지를 다시 추가할 수 없고, 반대로 패치 필터를 통해 필터링된 패치를 패키지 필터를 통해 다시 추가할 수 없습니다. 이 동작은 일반 거부 필터를 사용하여 많은 수의 패키지 또는 패치를 제외하고 특정 허용 필터가 적용된 특정 패키지 또는 패치를 \"선별\"하려는 경우에 유용합니다. 컨텐트 필터는 조직 전체에 적용되며 프로젝트 간에 공유할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트에 이미 빌드된 소스가 포함되어 있는 경우 환경을 추가하면 기존 내용이 자동으로 채워집니다. 내용은 주기의 이전 환경이 있는 경우 해당 환경에서 가져옵니다. 이전 환경이 없으면 프로젝트 소스가 다시 빌드될 때까지 비어 있습니다. 몇 가지 일반적인 시나리오에 대한 필터를 편리하게 생성할 수 있도록 Uyuni는 필터 템플릿을 제공합니다. 이러한 템플릿을 적용하면 특정 사용 사례에 맞게 사전에 필터 집합을 만드는 데 유용합니다. 이 섹션에서는 사용할 수 있는 템플릿과 그 사용법에 대해 설명합니다. 라이브 패치가 포함된 프로젝트에서는 정기적인 향후 커널 패키지를 제외해야 라이브 패치 패키지만 클라이언트에 대한 업데이트로 제공됩니다. 반면에 이미 설치된 일반 커널 패키지는 시스템 무결성을 유지하기 위해 여전히 포함되어야 합니다. 이 템플릿을 적용하면 이 동작을 수행하기 위해 필요한 필터 세 개가 생성됩니다. 기본 커널 버전과 동일한 kernel-default 패키지를 포함하는 패치 허용 reboot_suggested 키워드가 포함된 패치 거부 installhint(reboot-needed)라는 이름을 제공하는 패키지가 포함된 패치 거부 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터로 이동하고 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 개별 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 SUSE 제품 기반 라이브 패치를 선택합니다. 제품 필드에서 라이브 패치를 설정할 제품을 선택합니다. 커널 필드의 선택한 제품에서 사용할 수 있는 버전 목록에서 커널 버전을 선택합니다. 이후의 일반 커널 패치를 거부하는 필터는 이 버전을 기반으로 합니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭합니다. 지정된 접두사가 있는 필터 세 개를 선택하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 등록된 특정 시스템에 설치된 커널 버전을 기반으로 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하려면 \"시스템 기반 라이브 패치\" 템플릿을 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 템플릿을 적용하면 이 동작을 수행하기 위해 필요한 필터 세 개가 생성됩니다. 기본 커널 버전과 동일한 kernel-default 패키지를 포함하는 패치 허용 reboot_suggested 키워드가 포함된 패치 거부 installhint(reboot-needed)라는 이름을 제공하는 패키지가 포함된 패치 거부 라이브 패치 프로젝트를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#exclude-higher-kernel-version에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터로 이동하고 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 특정 시스템에 기반 라이브 패치를 선택합니다. 시스템 필드에서, 목록에서 시스템을 선택하거나 시스템 이름을 입력하여 옵션 범위를 좁힙니다. 커널 필드에서 선택한 시스템에 설치된 버전 목록에서 커널 버전을 선택합니다. 이후의 일반 커널 패치를 거부하는 필터는 이 버전을 기반으로 합니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 연결/해제를 클릭합니다. 지정된 접두사가 있는 필터 세 개를 선택하고 저장을 클릭합니다. 프로젝트에 포함된 모듈형 리포지토리에서 모든 모듈을 사용할 수 있도록 하려면 이 필터 템플릿을 사용하여 자동으로 추가할 수 있습니다. 적용되면 이 템플릿은 모듈 및 기본 스트림별로 AppStream 필터를 생성합니다. 이 프로세스가 프로젝트 페이지에서 수행되면 필터가 프로젝트에 자동으로 추가됩니다. 그렇지 않으면 생성된 필터를 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 필터에 나열하고 필요에 따라 모든 프로젝트에 추가할 수도 있습니다. 각 개별 필터를 편집하여 다른 모듈 스트림을 선택하거나 완전히 제거하여 대상 리포지토리에서 해당 모듈을 제외할 수 있습니다. 모든 모듈 스트림이 서로 호환되는 것은 아니므로, 개별 스트림을 변경하면 모듈 종속성을 성공적으로 해결하지 못할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 프로젝트 세부 사항 페이지의 필터 창에 문제를 설명하는 오류가 표시되고 모든 모듈 선택이 호환될 때까지 빌드 버튼이 비활성화됩니다. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 이상 모듈에는 정의된 기본 스트림이 없습니다. 그러므로 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9개의 소스와 함께 이 템플릿을 사용해도 효과가 없습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리를 사용하여 AppStream 리포지토리를 설정하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 administration:content-lifecycle-examples.adoc#appstream-filters에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 절차: 템플릿 적용 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하여 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 필터 섹션에서 필터 연결/해제를 클릭한 후 새 필터 생성을 클릭합니다. 대화 상자에서 템플릿 사용을 클릭합니다. 그에 따라 입력이 변경됩니다. 접두사 필드에 이름 접두사를 입력합니다. 이 값은 템플릿에 의해 생성된 모든 필터의 이름 앞에 추가됩니다. 템플릿이 프로젝트 컨텍스트에서 적용되는 경우 이 필드는 프로젝트 레이블로 미리 채워집니다. 템플릿 필드에서 기본값 포함 AppStream 모듈을 선택합니다. 채널 필드에서 모듈을 가져올 모듈형 채널을 선택합니다. 이 드롭다운에는 모듈형 채널만 표시됩니다. 저장을 클릭하여 필터를 생성합니다. 필터 섹션으로 스크롤하여 새로 연결된 AppStream 필터를 확인합니다. 개별 필터를 편집/제거하여 필요한 대로 프로젝트를 조정할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트를 생성하고 환경을 정의하며 소스와 필터를 첨부하면 처음으로 프로젝트를 빌드할 수 있습니다. 빌드는 연결된 소스에 필터를 적용하고 이를 프로젝트의 첫 번째 환경에 복제합니다. 동일한 벤더 채널을 여러 컨텐트 프로젝트의 소스로 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 Uyuni는 복제된 각 채널에 대해 새 패치 복제를 생성하지 않습니다. 대신 단일 패치 클론이 복제된 모든 채널 간에 공유됩니다. 벤더가 패치를 수정하면 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 패치가 철회되거나 패치 내의 패키지가 변경된 경우가 이에 해당합니다. 컨텐트 프로젝트 중 하나를 빌드하면 채널이 컨텐트 프로젝트의 다른 환경이나 조직의 다른 컨텐트 프로젝트 채널에 있더라도 복제된 패치를 공유하는 모든 채널이 기본적으로 원본과 동기화됩니다. 조직 설정에서 자동 패치 동기화를 해제하여 이 동작을 변경할 수 있습니다. 나중에 패치를 공유하는 모든 채널에 대해 수동으로 패치를 동기화하려면 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하고 동기화하려는 채널을 클릭한 후 동기화 하위 탭으로 이동합니다. 수동 패치 동기화도 패치를 공유하는 모든 조직 채널에 영향을 미칩니다. 절차: 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트 빌드 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하고 빌드할 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 사용 가능한 환경이 있는지 확인한 후 프로젝트를 빌드하십시오. 첨부된 소스 및 필터를 검토하고 빌드를 클릭합니다. 이 빌드의 변경 또는 업데이트 사항을 설명하는 버전 메시지를 제공합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 빌드 진행 상황을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 빌드가 완료되면 환경 버전이 하나씩 증가하고 소프트웨어 채널과 같이 빌드된 소스를 클라이언트에 할당할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트가 빌드되면 빌드된 소스를 순차적으로 환경으로 승격할 수 있습니다. 절차: 환경 승격 Uyuni Web UI에서 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트로 이동하고 작업할 프로젝트를 선택합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 후속 환경으로 승격할 환경을 찾고 승격을 클릭합니다. 환경 라이프싸이클 섹션에서 빌드 진행 상황을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트를 빌드 및 승격할 때 Uyuni는 소프트웨어 채널 트리를 생성합니다. 환경에 클라이언트를 추가하려면 클라이언트의 시스템 세부 정보 페이지의 소프트웨어 소프트웨어 채널을 사용하여 기본 및 하위 소프트웨어 채널을 클라이언트에 할당합니다. 새로 추가된 복제된 채널은 클라이언트에 자동으로 할당되지 않습니다. 소스를 추가 또는 승격하는 경우 채널 할당을 수동으로 확인하고 업데이트해야 합니다. 자동 할당은 향후 버전에서 Uyuni에 추가될 예정입니다.","title":"컨텐트 라이프싸이클 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"content-lifecycle","url":"/uyuni/administration/content-lifecycle.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 컨텐트 라이프싸이클 프로젝트 생성","hash":"_컨텐트_라이프싸이클_프로젝트_생성","id":1},{"text":"2. 필터 유형","hash":"_필터_유형","id":2},{"text":"2.1. 필터 규칙 파라미터","hash":"_필터_규칙_파라미터","id":3},{"text":"3. 필터 템플릿","hash":"filter-templates","id":4},{"text":"3.1.

When it has processed, the imported image is listed on the Image List page. 절차: 이미지 임포트 이미지 이미지 목록에서 임포트를 클릭하여 이미지 임포트 대화 상자를 엽니다. 이미지 임포트 대화 상자에서 다음 필드를 입력합니다. 이미지 저장소 검사를 위해 이미지를 끌어오는 레지스트리입니다. 이미지 이름 레지스트리에 있는 이미지의 이름입니다. 이미지 버전 레지스트리에 있는 이미지의 버전입니다. 빌드 호스트 이미지를 끌어오고 검사하는 빌드 호스트입니다. 활성화 키 이미지를 검사하는 소프트웨어 채널에 대한 경로를 제공하는 활성화 키입니다. 확인하려면 임포트를 클릭합니다. 이미지 항목이 데이터베이스에 생성되고 Uyuni에 대한 이미지 검사 작업이 예약됩니다. 처리가 완료되면 이미지 목록에서 임포트한 이미지를 찾을 수 있습니다. 이미지를 임포트했음을 나타내기 위해 빌드 열에 다른 아이콘이 표시됩니다. 임포트한 이미지의 상태 아이콘은 이미지의 개요 탭에서도 확인할 수 있습니다. 기본 컨테이너 이미지(BCI)는 이 이미지를 실행하기 위한 모든 소프트웨어와 함께 제공되지만, BCI는 경량이므로 검사에 필요한 모든 도구와 라이브러리가 제공되지 않을 수 있습니다. 컨테이너 이미지를 검사할 때 다음과 같은 오류 메시지가 표시될 수 있습니다. libssl.so.1.1:공유 객체 파일을 열 수 없음: 해당 파일 또는 디렉토리 없음 컨테이너 빌드 호스트와 Salt 번들을 검사에 사용하는 경우 뿐만 아니라 다른 상황에서도 BCI를 사용할 수 있지만, 검사를 작동시키기 위해서는 모든 필수 소프트웨어를 미리 추가해야 합니다. 이러한 문제를 방지하려면 Dockerfile을 사용하여 이미지에 libopenssl을 추가하고 이미지를 다시 빌드해야 합니다. libexpat의 경우에도 마찬가지입니다. 이미지 작업과 관련하여 알려진 몇 가지 문제는 다음과 같습니다. 레지스트리 또는 git 리포지토리에 액세스하기 위한 HTTPS 인증서는 사용자 정의 상태 파일을 사용하여 클라이언트에 배포해야 합니다. 현재 Docker를 사용한 SSH git 액세스는 지원되지 않습니다. OS 이미지는 Kiwi 빌드 시스템에 의해 빌드됩니다. 출력 이미지는 사용자 정의가 가능하며 PXE, QCOW2, LiveCD 또는 기타 유형의 이미지일 수 있습니다. Kiwi 빌드 시스템에 대한 자세한 내용은 Kiwi 문서에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Kiwi 이미지 빌드 기능은 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11이 실행되는 Salt 클라이언트에서 사용할 수 있습니다. Kiwi 이미지 구성 파일 및 구성 스크립트는 다음 위치 중 한 곳에서 액세스할 수 있어야 합니다. Git 리포지토리 HTTP 또는 HTTPS 호스팅 tar 아카이브 빌드 호스트 상의 로컬 디렉토리 git에서 제공하는 전체 Kiwi 리포지토리의 예는 https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Kiwi로 빌드된 OS 이미지를 실행하는 호스트에는 사용할 수 있는 1 GB 이상 RAM이 필요합니다. 디스크 공간은 이미지의 실제 크기에 따라 다릅니다. 자세한 내용은 기본 시스템 설명서에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Uyuni로 모든 종류의 이미지를 빌드하려면 빌드 호스트를 생성 및 구성합니다. OS 이미지 빌드 호스트는 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15(SP2 이상) 또는 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12(SP4 이상)에서 실행되는 Salt 클라이언트입니다. 이 절차는 빌드 호스트의 초기 구성을 설명합니다. 빌드 호스트의 운영 체제는 대상 이미지의 운영 체제와 일치해야 합니다. 예를 들어, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15(SP2 이상) OS 버전으로 구동되는 빌드 호스트에서는 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 기반 이미지를 빌드합니다. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 또는 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP4 OS 버전으로 구동되는 빌드 호스트에서는 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 기반 이미지를 빌드합니다. 아키텍처 간에는 빌드할 수 없습니다. 예를 들어, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3가 실행 중인 Raspberry PI(aarch64 아키텍처) 빌드 호스트에서는 Raspberry PI SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 이미지를 빌드해야 합니다. 절차: Uyuni Web UI에서 빌드 호스트 구성 시스템 개요 페이지에서 빌드 호스트로 지정할 클라이언트를 선택합니다. Navigate to the System Details Properties tab, and check the Add-on System Type > OS Image Build Host box. Confirm with Update Properties. 시스템 세부 사항 소프트웨어 소프트웨어 채널로 이동하고 빌드 호스트 버전에 따라 필요한 소프트웨어 채널을 활성화합니다. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 빌드 호스트에는 Uyuni 클라이언트 도구(SLE-Manager-Tools12-Pool 및 SLE-Manager-Tools12-Updates)가 필요합니다. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 빌드 호스트에는 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 모듈 SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP2-Pool 및 SLE-Module-DevTools15-SP2-Updates가 필요합니다. 예약하고 확인을 클릭합니다. Highstate를 적용하여 Kiwi 및 모든 필수 패키지를 설치합니다. 시스템 세부 사항 페이지에서 상태 Highstate를 선택하고 Highstate 적용을 클릭합니다. 또는 Uyuni 서버 명령줄에서 Highstate를 적용합니다. salt '$your_client' state.highstate 빌드 호스트 프로비저닝은 Uyuni 인증서 RPM을 빌드 호스트에 복사합니다. 이 인증서는 Uyuni에서 제공하는 리포지토리에 액세스하기 위한 용도로 사용됩니다. 인증서는 mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage 패키지 스크립트에 의해 RPM으로 패키징됩니다. 패키지 스크립트는 새 Uyuni 설치 중에 자동으로 호출됩니다. spacewalk-certs-tools 패키지를 업그레이드하는 경우 업그레이드 시나리오는 기본값을 사용하여 패키지 스크립트를 호출합니다. 그러나 인증서 경로가 변경되었거나 사용할 수 없는 경우 업그레이드 절차가 완료된 후 --ca-cert-full-path <path_to_certificate>를 사용하여 패키지 스크립트를 수동으로 호출하십시오. /usr/sbin/mgr-package-rpm-certificate-osimage --ca-cert-full-path /root/ssl-build/RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT 인증서가 포함된 RPM 패키지는 다음과 같이 Salt가 액세스할 수 있는 디렉토리에 저장됩니다. /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm 인증서가 포함된 RPM 패키지는 다음 로컬 빌드 호스트 리포지토리에 제공됩니다. /var/lib/Kiwi/repo 빌드 소스에 Uyuni SSL 인증서가 포함된 RPM 패키지를 지정하고 Kiwi 구성에 부트스트랩 섹션의 필수 패키지로 rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage가 포함되어 있는지 확인합니다. Listing 1. config.xml ... <packages type=\"bootstrap\"> ... <package name=\"rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage\" bootinclude=\"true\"/> </packages> ... 이미지를 빌드할 때 OS 이미지가 리포지토리로 사용할 수 있는 채널과 연결된 활성화 키를 생성합니다. 활성화 키는 OS 이미지 빌드에 필수입니다.

Uyuni 공용 인증서가 포함된 RPM 패키지는 최신 버전이며 /usr/share/susemanager/salt/images/rhn-org-trusted-ssl-cert-osimage-1.0-1.noarch.rpm에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 공용 인증서 RPM을 새로 고치는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 빌드 호스트 생성에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에는 이미지 관련 작업을 할 때 알려진 몇 가지 문제가 포함되어 있습니다. HTTP 소스 또는 git 리포지토리에 액세스하기 위해 사용되는 HTTPS 인증서는 사용자 정의 상태 파일을 통해 클라이언트에 배포하거나 수동으로 구성해야 합니다. Kiwi 기반 이미지 임포트는 지원되지 않습니다. 사용할 수 있는 빌드 이미지를 나열하려면 이미지 이미지 목록를 선택하십시오. 모든 이미지 목록이 표시됩니다. 이미지에 대해 표시되는 데이터에는 이미지 이름, 버전, 리비전 및 빌드 상태가 포함됩니다. 이미지에 사용할 수 있는 가능한 패치 및 패키지 업데이트 목록을 통해 이미지 업데이트 상태를 확인할 수도 있습니다. OS 이미지의 경우 이름 및 버전 필드는 Kiwi 소스에서 제공되며 빌드가 성공적으로 완료되면 업데이트됩니다. 빌드 중 또는 빌드 실패 후, 이 필드에는 프로파일 이름을 기반으로 하는 임시 이름이 표시됩니다. 리비전은 빌드가 성공할 때마다 자동으로 증가합니다. OS 이미지의 경우 저장소에 여러 리비전이 함께 있을 수 있습니다. 컨테이너 이미지의 경우 저장소에는 최신 리비전만 보존됩니다. 이전 버전(패키지, 패치 등)에 대한 정보는 보존되며 구식 표시 확인란을 사용하여 나열할 수 있습니다. 이미지에서 자세히 버튼을 클릭하면 자세한 내용을 확인할 수 있습니다. 상세 보기에는 관련 패치의 정확한 목록, 이미지 내에 설치된 모든 패키지 목록 및 빌드 로그가 포함됩니다. 삭제 버튼을 클릭하면 목록에서 이미지가 삭제됩니다. 또한, 관련 열, OS 이미지 저장소의 파일 및 사용되지 않는 리비전도 삭제됩니다. 빌드가 성공한 후 상태를 검사한 경우에만 패치 및 패키지 목록을 사용할 수 있습니다.","title":"이미지 빌드 및 관리","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"image-management","url":"/uyuni/administration/image-management.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 이미지 빌드 개요","hash":"at.images.overview","id":1},{"text":"2. 컨테이너 이미지","hash":"at.images.docker","id":2},{"text":"2.1. 요구사항","hash":"at.images.docker.requirements","id":3},{"text":"2.2. 빌드 호스트 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.buildhost","id":4},{"text":"2.3. 컨테이너에 대한 활성화 키 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.buildchannels","id":5},{"text":"2.4. 이미지 저장소 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.imagestore","id":6},{"text":"2.5. 이미지 프로파일 생성","hash":"at.images.docker.profile","id":7},{"text":"2.5.1. 예시 Dockerfile 소스","hash":"at.images.docker.sourceexample","id":8},{"text":"2.5.2. 사용자 정의 정보 키-값 쌍을 Docker buildargs로 사용","hash":"_사용자_정의_정보_키_값_쌍을_docker_buildargs로_사용","id":9},{"text":"2.6. 이미지 빌드","hash":"at.images.docker.building","id":10},{"text":"2.7. 이미지 임포트","hash":"at.images.docker.importing","id":11},{"text":"2.8. 문제 해결","hash":"at.images.docker.troubleshooting","id":12},{"text":"2.8.1. 이미지 검사","hash":"_이미지_검사","id":13},{"text":"2.8.2. 일반 문제","hash":"_일반_문제","id":14},{"text":"3.

SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 openSUSE Leap 15.x Uyuni 서버와 별도의 시스템에 Prometheus 및 Grafana를 설치해야 합니다. 모니터링 서버로 관리되는 Salt SUSE 클라이언트를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 다른 클라이언트는 모니터링 서버로 지원되지 않습니다. Prometheus는 풀 방식을 사용하여 메트릭을 가져오므로 서버는 모니터링되는 클라이언트에 대한 TCP 연결을 설정할 수 있어야 합니다. 클라이언트에는 해당하는 열린 포트가 있어야 하며 네트워크를 통해 연결할 수 있어야 합니다. 또는, 역방향 프록시를 사용하여 연결을 설정할 수 있습니다. Prometheus는 시계열 데이터베이스에 실시간 메트릭을 기록하기 위해 사용되는 오픈 소스 모니터링 도구입니다. 메트릭은 HTTP를 통해 끌어오며, 고성능과 확장성을 가능하게 합니다.

Prometheus 커뮤니티는 공식 엑스포트 목록을 제공하며, 커뮤니티 기여를 통해 더욱 추가될 것입니다. 자세한 내용과 광범위한 엑스포트 목록은 https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Grafana는 데이터 시각화, 모니터링 및 분석을 위한 도구입니다. 그리고 일정 기간 동안 특정 메트릭을 나타내는 패널이 포함된 대시보드를 생성하기 위한 용도로 사용됩니다. 일반적으로 Grafana는 Prometheus와 함께 사용되지만, ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL 및 Influx DB와 같은 다른 데이터 소스도 지원합니다. Grafana에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://grafana.com/docs/에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 모니터링 서버를 설정하려면 Prometheus와 Grafana를 설치 및 구성해야 합니다. 모니터링 서버가 Salt 클라이언트인 경우 Uyuni Web UI를 사용하여 Prometheus 패키지를 설치할 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않으면 모니터링 서버에 패키지를 수동으로 다운로드하여 설치할 수 있습니다.

SCAP(Security Content Automation Protocol)는 커뮤니티 아이디어에서 파생된 상호 운용이 가능한 사양의 종합으로, 엔터프라이즈 시스템의 시스템 보안을 유지하기 위해 NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)에서 유지보수하는 사양군입니다. SCAP는 시스템 보안을 유지하기 위한 표준화된 접근 방식을 제공하기 위해 만들어졌으며, 사용되는 표준은 커뮤니티 및 엔터프라이즈 비즈니스의 니즈를 충족하기 위해 지속적으로 변경됩니다. 일관적이고 반복 가능한 개정 작업 흐름을 제공하기 위해 신규 사양은 NIST의 SCAP 릴리스 주기에 의해 관리됩니다. 자세한 내용은 다음에서 확인할 수 있습니다. https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol https://www.open-scap.org/features/standards/ https://ncp.nist.gov/repository?scap Uyuni는 OpenSCAP를 사용하여 SCAP 사양을 구현합니다. OpenSCAP는 XCCDF(Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format)를 활용하는 감사 도구입니다. XCCDF는 검사 목록의 내용을 나타내는 표준 방식이며 보안 검사 목록을 정의합니다. 또한, CPE(Common Platform Enumeration), CCE(Common Configuration Enumeration), OVAL(Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language)과 같은 다른 사양과 결합하여 SCAP 인증 제품에서 처리할 수 있는 SCAP로 표시되는 검사 목록을 생성합니다. OpenSCAP는 SUSE 보안 팀에서 생성한 컨텐트를 사용하여 패치가 있는지 확인합니다. OpenSCAP은 시스템 보안 구성 설정을 확인하고 표준 및 사양에 기반한 규칙을 활용하여 시스템의 손상 징후를 검사합니다. SUSE 보안 팀에 대한 자세한 내용은 https://www.suse.com/support/security를 참조하십시오. 시작하기 전, SCAP 스캔을 위해 클라이언트 시스템을 준비해야 합니다. SSH 연락 방법을 사용하는 Salt 클라이언트에서는 OpenSCAP 감사를 사용할 수 없습니다. 스캔 클라이언트는 스캔이 수행 중인 클라이언트에서 대규모의 메모리와 컴퓨팅 파워를 소모할 수 있습니다. Red Hat 클라이언트의 경우 스캔할 각 클라이언트에서 최소 2 GB의 RAM을 사용할 수 있어야 합니다. 시작하기 전에 클라이언트에 OpenSCAP 스캐너와 SCAP Security Guide(컨텐트) 패키지를 설치합니다. 운영 체제에 따라 이러한 패키지는 기본 운영 체제 또는 Uyuni 클라이언트 도구에 포함되어 있습니다. 아래 테이블에는 필요한 패키지가 나열되어 있습니다. Table 1. OpenSCAP 패키지 운영 체제 스캐너 컨텐트 SLES openscap-utils scap-security-guide openSUSE openscap-utils scap-security-guide RHEL openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat CentOS openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Oracle Linux openscap-utils scap-security-guide-redhat Ubuntu libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-ubuntu Debian libopenscap8 scap-security-guide-debian RHEL 7 및 호환 시스템은 오래된 컨텐트가 포함된 scap-security-guide 패키지를 제공합니다. Uyuni 클라이언트 도구에 포함된 scap-security-guide-redhat 패키지를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. SUSE는 다양한 openscap 프로파일에 대한 scap-security-guide 패키지를 제공합니다. scap-security-guide의 현재 버전에서 SUSE가 지원하는 프로파일: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 DISA STIG 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 ANSSI-BP-028 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 PCI-DSS 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15용 HIPAA 프로파일 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 및 15용 CIS 프로파일 SAP Applications 15용 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server의 공용 클라우드 이미지 강화 SUSE Linux Enterprise 15용 공용 클라우드 강화 SLE 12 및 15용 표준 시스템 보안 프로파일 이 목록의 다른 프로파일은 커뮤니티에서 제공한 것이며 SUSE에서 공식적으로 지원하지 않습니다. 비SUSE 운영 체제의 경우 포함된 프로파일은 커뮤니티에서 제공하는 프로파일입니다. SUSE에서는 공식적으로 지원하지 않습니다. OpenSCAP는 SCAP 컨텐트 파일을 사용하여 테스트 규칙을 정의합니다. 이러한 컨텐트 파일은 XCCDF 또는 OVAL 표준을 기반으로 생성됩니다. SCAP 보안 가이드뿐만 아니라 공개적으로 사용할 수 있는 컨텐트 파일을 다운로드하고 요구사항에 따라 사용자 정의할 수 있습니다. 그리고 기본 컨텐트 파일 템플릿용 SCAP 보안 가이드 패키지를 설치할 수 있습니다. 또는 XCCDF 또는 OVAL에 익숙한 경우 자체 컨텐트 파일을 생성할 수 있습니다. 템플릿을 사용하여 SCAP 컨텐트 파일을 생성하는 것이 권장됩니다. 자체 사용자 정의 컨텐트 파일을 생성 및 사용하는 경우 자신이 모든 위험을 감수해야 합니다. 사용자 정의 컨텐트 파일을 사용하여 시스템이 손상된 경우 SUSE에서 지원하지 않을 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 파일을 생성한 후에는 해당 파일을 클라이언트로 전송해야 합니다. 물리적 저장 매체를 사용하거나 Salt(예: salt-cp 또는 Salt File Server), ftp 또는 scp를 사용하여 네트워크를 통해 다른 파일을 이동할 때와 동일한 방식으로 이 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. Uyuni로 관리하는 클라이언트에 컨텐트 파일을 배포하는 패키지를 생성하는 것이 권장됩니다. 무결성을 보장하기 위해 패키지가 서명 및 검증될 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 사용자 정의 채널에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 운영 체제에 따라 다양한 OpenSCAP 컨텐트 파일 및 프로파일을 사용할 수 있습니다. 컨텐트 파일 한 개에는 프로파일이 두 개 이상 포함될 수 있습니다. RPM 기반 운영 체제에서 다음 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 SCAP 파일의 위치를 확인합니다. rpm -ql <scap-security-guide-package-name-from-table> DEB 기반 운영 체제에서 다음 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 SCAP 파일의 위치를 확인합니다. dpkg -L <scap-security-guide-package-name-from-table> 요구사항에 적합한 SCAP 컨텐트 파일 한 개를 찾은 경우 클라이언트에서 사용 가능한 프로필을 나열합니다. oscap info ./usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml Document type: Source Data Stream Imported: 2021-03-24T18:14:45 스트림: scap_org.open-scap_datastream_from_xccdf_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml 생성됨: (null) 버전: 1.2 체크리스트: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-xccdf-1.2.xml 상태: draft 생성됨: 2021-03-24 해결됨: true 프로파일: 제목: CIS SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Benchmark Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis 제목: Standard System Security Profile for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard 제목: DISA STIG for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig 참조된 확인 파일: ssg-sle15-oval.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 ssg-sle15-ocil.xml system: http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2 https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/suse.linux.enterprise.15.xml system: http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 확인: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-oval.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-ocil.xml Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-oval.xml 사전: Ref-Id: scap_org.open-scap_cref_ssg-sle15-cpe-dictionary.xml 스캔을 수행하기 위한 파일 경로 및 프로파일을 기록해 둡니다. 컨텐트 파일을 설치 또는 전송하면 감사 스캔을 수행할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI를 사용하여 감사 스캔을 트리거할 수 있습니다. Uyuni API를 사용하여 정기 검사를 예약할 수도 있습니다. 절차: Web UI에서 감사 스캔 실행 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 시스템 목록으로 이동하여 스캔할 클라이언트를 선택합니다. 감사 탭으로 이동하여 일정 하위 탭으로 이동합니다. XCCDF 문서 경로 필드에 클라이언트에서 사용할 SCAP 템플릿 및 프로파일에 대한 파라미터를 입력합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. 명령: /usr/bin/oscap xccdf eval 명령줄 인수: --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig XCCDF 문서의 경로: /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml --fetch-remote-resources 파라미터를 사용하면 대량의 RAM이 필요합니다. 또한, file_recv_max_size 값을 늘려야 할 수도 있습니다. 스캔은 클라이언트의 다음번에 예약된 동기화 시 실행됩니다. XCCDF 컨텐트 파일은 유효성을 검사한 후 원격 시스템에서 실행됩니다. 컨텐트 파일에 잘못된 인수가 포함되면 테스트가 실패합니다. 절차: API에서 감사 스캔 실행 시작하기 전, 스캔할 클라이언트에 Python 및 XML-RPC 라이브러리가 설치되어 있는지 확인합니다. 기존 스크립트를 선택하거나 system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan을 통해 시스템 검사를 예약하기 위한 스크립트를 생성합니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. #!/usr/bin/python3 client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('https://server.example.com/rpc/api') key = client.auth.login('username', 'password') client.system.scap.scheduleXccdfScan(key, <1000010001>, '<path_to_xccdf_file.xml>', '--profile <profile_name>') 이 예에서: * <1000010001>은 시스템 ID(sid)입니다. * <path_to_xccdf_file.xml>은 클라이언트의 컨텐트 파일 위치에 대한 경로입니다. 예를 들어, /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-sle15-ds-1.2.xml입니다. * <profile_name>은 oscap 명령에 대한 추가 인수입니다. 예를 들어, united_states_government_configuration_baseline(USGCB)을 사용합니다. 명령 프롬프트에서, 스캔할 클라이언트의 스크립트를 실행합니다. 실행한 검사에 대한 정보는 Uyuni Web UI에 있습니다. 결과 테이블을 확인하려면 감사 OpenSCAP 모든 스캔으로 이동합니다. 이 테이블의 데이터에 대한 자세한 내용은 All Scans에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 스캔에 대한 자세한 정보를 사용하려면 클라이언트에서 활성화해야 합니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 관리자 조직으로 이동하고 클라이언트가 속한 조직을 클릭합니다. 구성 탭으로 이동하여 자세한 SCAP 파일 업로드 활성화 옵션을 선택합니다. 활성화하면, 모든 스캔에서 자세한 정보가 포함된 추가 HTML 파일이 생성됩니다. 결과에는 다음과 유사한 추가 라인이 표시됩니다. 자세한 결과: xccdf-report.html xccdf-results.xml scap-yast2sec-oval.xml.result.xml 명령줄에서 스캔 정보를 검색하려면 spacewalk-report 명령을 사용합니다. spacewalk-report system-history-scap spacewalk-report scap-scan spacewalk-report scap-scan-results Uyuni API를 사용하여 system.scap 핸들러로 결과를 확인할 수도 있습니다. 클라이언트 시스템을 강화하기 위해 수정 Bash 스크립트와 Ansible 플레이북이 동일한 SCAP 보안 가이드 패키지에 제공됩니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다.

SUSE는 권고 상태를 (\"최종\" 또는 \"안정\" 대신) \"철회\"로 설정하여 이러한 패치를 거의 즉시 취소하는 \"철회된 패치\"라는 새로운 메커니즘(2021년)을 도입했습니다. 패치의 권고 상태 특성이 \"철회\"로 설정되면 패치가 \"철회\"됩니다. 패키지는 \"철회된\" 패치에 속하는 경우 \"철회\"됩니다. 철회된 패치 또는 패키지는 Uyuni가 설치된 시스템에 설치할 수 없습니다. 철회된 패키지를 설치하는 유일한 방법은 zypper install을 사용하여 수동으로 설치하고 정확한 패키지 버전을 지정하는 것입니다. 예는 다음과 같습니다. zypper install vim-8.0.1568-5.14.1 패치 및 패키지의 철회 상태는 Uyuni의 Web UI에 아이콘으로 표시됩니다. 다음 예시를 참조할 수 있습니다. 채널 내 패키지 목록 채널 내 패치 목록 시스템에 설치된 패치 또는 패키지가 철회되면 해당 시스템의 설치된 패키지 목록에 아이콘도 표시됩니다.

SSL을 사용하여 Uyuni 서버에 등록하는 모든 클라이언트는 서버 인증서에 대해 유효성을 검사하여 올바른 서버에 연결하고 있는지 확인합니다. 이 프로세스를 SSL 핸드셰이크라고 합니다. SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 클라이언트는 서버 인증서의 호스트 이름이 필요한 이름과 일치하는지 확인합니다. 클라이언트는 또한 서버 인증서가 신뢰할 수 있는지 확인해야 합니다. 인증 기관(CA)은 다른 인증서에 서명하기 위해 사용되는 인증서입니다. 모든 인증서는 인증 기관(CA)에서 서명해야 유효한 것으로 간주되며 클라이언트가 인증서에 대해 일치시킬 수 있습니다. SSL 인증이 올바르게 작동하려면 클라이언트가 루트 CA를 신뢰해야 합니다. 즉, 루트 CA가 모든 클라이언트에 설치되어야 합니다. SSL 인증의 기본 방법은 Uyuni가 자체 서명 인증서를 사용하는 것입니다. 이 경우 Uyuni가 모든 인증서를 생성했으며 루트 CA가 서버 인증서에 직접 서명합니다. 중간 CA를 사용하는 방법도 있습니다. 이 경우 루트 CA는 중간 CA에 서명합니다. 그런 다음 중간 CA는 원하는 수의 다른 중간 CA에 서명할 수 있으며 마지막 CA는 서버 인증서에 서명합니다. 이를 체인 인증서라고 합니다. 연결된 인증서에서 중간 CA를 사용하는 경우, 루트 CA는 클라이언트에 설치되고 서버 인증서는 서버에 설치됩니다. SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 클라이언트는 루트 CA와 서버 인증서 사이의 전체 중간 인증서 체인을 확인할 수 있어야 하므로, 모든 중간 인증서에 액세스할 수 있어야 합니다. 이를 달성하는 두 가지 주요 방법이 있습니다. 이전 버전의 Uyuni에서는 기본적으로 모든 중간 CA가 클라이언트에 설치됩니다. 그러나 서버에서 서비스를 구성하여 클라이언트에 제공할 수도 있습니다. 이 경우 SSL 핸드셰이크 동안 서버는 서버 인증서와 모든 중간 CA를 제공합니다. 이제 이 방식이 기본 구성으로 사용됩니다. 기본적으로 Uyuni는 중간 CA 없이 자체 서명 인증서를 사용합니다. 추가 보안을 위해 인증서에 서명하도록 타사 CA를 지정할 수 있습니다. 타사 CA는 인증서에 검사를 수행하여 포함된 정보가 올바른지 확인합니다. 그리고 일반적으로 이 서비스에 대해 연간 요금을 청구합니다. 타사 CA를 사용하면 인증서를 스푸핑하기 더 어렵고 설치에 대한 추가 보호가 제공됩니다. 타사 CA에서 서명한 인증서가 있는 경우 Uyuni 설치로 임포트할 수 있습니다. 이 설명서에서는 SSL 인증서 사용을 2단계로 설명합니다. Uyuni 도구를 사용한 자체 서명 인증서 생성 방법 Uyuni 서버 또는 프록시에 인증서 배포 방법 자체 또는 외부 PKI와 같은 타사 인스턴스에서 인증서가 제공되는 경우 한 단계를 건너뛸 수 있습니다. 자체 서명 인증서 생성에 대한 자세한 내용은 자체 서명된 SSL 인증서에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 인증서 임포트에 대한 자세한 내용은 SSL 인증서 임포트에서 확인할 수 있습니다.

These tabs are: 패키지 구성 그룹 활성화된 시스템 AppStreams(모듈형 채널이 활성화 키와 연결될 때마다 사용 가능) 클라이언트를 다시 등록하고 모든 Uyuni 설정을 다시 확보하기 위한 목적으로 재활성화 키를 한 번만 사용할 수 있습니다. 재활성화 키는 클라이언트 전용이며 시스템 ID, 이력, 그룹 및 채널을 포함합니다. 재활성화 키를 생성하려면 시스템으로 이동한 후 클라이언트를 클릭하여 재활성화 키를 생성하고, 상세 정보 재활성 탭으로 이동하십시오. 새 키 생성을 클릭하여 재활성화 키를 생성합니다. 나중에 사용할 수 있도록 키의 상세 정보를 기록해 둡니다. 특정 시스템 ID와 연결되지 않은 일반적인 활성화 키와 달리 여기에서 생성한 키는 시스템 활성화 키 페이지에 표시되지 않습니다. 재활성화 키를 생성한 후에는 /etc/salt/minion.d/susemanager.conf에서 management_key 입자로 사용할 수 있습니다. 예: grains: susemanager: management_key: \"re-1-daf44db90c0853edbb5db03f2b37986e\" 재활성화 키를 적용하려면 venv-salt-minion 또는 salt-minion 프로세스를 다시 시작합니다. 재활성화 키를 부트스트랩 스크립트와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다. 부트스트랩 스크립트에 대한 자세한 내용은 Register Clients With a Bootstrap Script을 참조하십시오. 클라이언트를 기존 Uyuni 프로파일과 함께 자동 설치하는 경우 프로파일은 재활성화 키를 사용해 시스템을 다시 등록하고 설정을 복원합니다. 프로파일 기반 자동 설치가 진행 중일 때는 이 키를 재생성, 삭제 또는 사용하지 마십시오. 그러면 자동 설치에 실패하게 됩니다. 기본 상위 채널 Avoid using the Uyuni Default parent channel. This setting forces Uyuni to choose a parent channel that best corresponds to the installed operating system, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, we recommend you create activation keys specific to each distribution and architecture. Bootstrapping With Activation Keys 부트스트랩 스크립트를 사용 중인 경우 각 스크립트에 대해 활성화 키를 생성하는 것을 고려하십시오. 이렇게 하면 채널 할당, 패키지 설치, 시스템 그룹 구성원, 구성 채널 할당을 조정하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 또한 등록 후 시스템에 대한 수동 개입이 덜 필요합니다. Bootstrapping LTSS Clients LTSS 구독을 사용하여 클라이언트를 부스트랩하는 경우 활성화 키 생성 중에 LTSS 채널을 포함시켜야 합니다. 대역폭 요구사항 활성화 키를 사용하면 등록 시점에 소프트웨어가 자동으로 다운로드될 수 있는데, 대역폭이 제한된 환경에서는 바람직하지 않을 수 있습니다. 이러한 옵션은 대역폭 사용량을 생성합니다. SUSE 제품 풀 채널을 할당하면 해당 제품 설명자 패키지가 자동으로 설치됩니다. 섹션의 모든 패키지가 Packages 설치됩니다. 구성 섹션의 모든 Salt 상태가 그 내용에 따라 다운로드를 트리거할 수 있습니다. 키 레이블 명명 활성화 키에 대해 읽을 수 있는 이름을 입력하지 않으면 시스템이 수 스트링을 자동으로 생성하므로 키를 관리하기 어려울 수 있습니다. 키를 추적하는 데 도움이 되는 활성화 키 명명 스키마를 고려하십시오. 조직의 인프라와 관련이 있는 이름을 생성하면 더 복잡한 작업을 더 쉽게 수행할 수 있습니다. 키 레이블을 생성할 때 다음과 같은 팁을 참고하십시오. OS 명명(필수): 키는 항상 자신이 설정을 제공하는 대상인 OS를 참조해야 합니다. 아키텍처 명명(권장): 귀사가 단 하나의 아키텍처(예: x86_64)만 운영하고 있지 않다면 레이블에 아키텍처 유형을 제공하는 것이 좋습니다. 서버 유형 명명: 이 서버를 어떤 목적으로 사용 중입니까? 위치 명명: 서버가 어디에 있습니까? 서버룸, 건물 또는 부서 내? 날짜 명명: 유지보수 기간, 분기 등 사용자 정의 명명: 어떤 명명 스키마가 조직의 필요에 적합합니까? 활성화 키 레이블 이름의 예: sles15-sp4-web_server-room_129-x86_64 sles15-sp4-test_packages-blg_502-room_21-ppc64le 포함된 채널 활성화 키를 생성할 때는 어떤 소프트웨어 채널이 연결되어 있는지도 기억해 두어야 합니다. 키에는 할당된 특정 기본 채널이 있어야 합니다. 기본값으로 설정된 기본 채널은 사용하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 설치하려는 클라이언트 운영 체제를 참조하십시오.","title":"활성화 키","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"activation-keys","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/activation-keys.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 활성화 키","hash":"activation-keys-reactivation","id":1},{"text":"2. 활성화 키 모범 사례","hash":"_활성화_키_모범_사례","id":2}]},"53":{"id":53,"text":"AppStream 채널에 가입한 클라이언트를 관리하는 경우 Uyuni은 현재 활성화된 AppStream 모듈 세트에 따라 클라이언트에서 사용할 수 있는 패키지를 필터링합니다.

Cobbler를 사용한 ISO 이미지 준비에 대한 설명은 Cobbler를 사용한 ISO 이미지 빌드를 참조하십시오. SUSE 시스템의 경우 KIWI를 사용하여 ISO 이미지를 준비하는 것이 권장되는 경우가 많습니다. 자세한 내용은 KIWI를 사용한 SUSE ISO 이미지 빌드를 참조하십시오. 모든 경우에 결과 이미지를 CD-ROM으로 굽거나 USB 키를 준비해야 합니다. Cobbler는 PXE 설치와 유사한 방식으로 작동하는 배포 세트, 커널 및 메뉴가 포함된 ISO 부팅 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다. IBM Z에서는 Cobbler를 사용한 ISO 빌드를 지원하지 않습니다. Cobbler를 사용하여 ISO 이미지를 준비하려면 PXE를 통한 네트워크 부팅을 사용하는 것과 유사하게 배포 및 프로파일을 준비해야 합니다. 배포판 생성에 대한 설명은 자동 설치 가능한 배포판을 참조하십시오. 프로파일 생성에 대한 설명은 자동 설치 프로파일을 참조하십시오. The Cobbler buildiso command takes parameters to define the name and output location of the boot ISO. Specifying the distribution with --distro is mandatory when running buildiso command. --iso is the output location: mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro=<your-distro-label> 배포 및 프로파일 레이블은 Web UI에 표시된 대로가 아니라 Cobbler에 나열된 대로 사용해야 합니다. Cobbler에 저장된 배포 및 프로파일의 이름을 나열하려면 다음 명령을 실행합니다. mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list mgrctl exec -- cobbler profile list 부팅 ISO에는 모든 프로파일 및 시스템이 기본적으로 포함되어 있습니다. --profiles 및 --systems 옵션을 사용하면 사용되는 프로파일 및 시스템을 제한할 수 있습니다. mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso --systems=\"system1 system2 system3\" \\ --profiles=\"<your-profile1-label> <your-profile2-label> <your-profile3-label>\" \\ --distro=<your-distro-label> With --esp you can enable the built boot ISOs with Secure Boot. You explicitly specify the EFI System Partition (ESP). By default, Cobbler generates the ESP partition, which disables Secure Boot. mgrctl exec -- cobbler buildiso \\ --esp=\"/usr/share/tftpboot-installation/SLE-15-SP6-x86_64/boot/x86_64/efi\" \\ --iso=/path/to/boot.iso --distro=<your-distro-label> Procedure: Finding efi On the container host, execute the following command to get the distro name: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro list This command outputs strings such as sles15-sp6:1:SUSE. On the container host, execute the following command to get information about the distro files location: mgrctl exec -- cobbler distro report --name sles15-sp6:1:SUSE This command outputs a report such as the following: Name : sles15-sp6:1:SUSE Architecture : x86_64 ...output omitted...

ISO 이미지를 공용 tmp 디렉토리에 쓸 수 없는 경우 /usr/lib/systemd/system/cobblerd.service에서 systemd 설정을 확인하십시오. KIWI는 이미지 생성 시스템입니다. KIWI를 사용하여 SUSE 시스템을 설치하기 위한 대상 시스템에서 사용되는 부팅 가능한 ISO 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다. 시스템은 재부팅되거나 켜질 때 이 이미지로 부팅되고, Uyuni에서 AutoYaST 구성을 로드하며, AutoYaST 프로파일에 따라 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server를 설치합니다. ISO 이미지를 사용하려면 시스템을 부팅하고 프롬프트에 autoyast를 입력하십시오(AutoYaST 부팅을 위한 레이블을 autoyast 상태로 두었다고 가정함). Enter 키를 눌러 AutoYaST 설치를 시작합니다.

Uyuni의 패키지 검색 입력 상자에서 이름이 tftpboot-installation으로 시작하는 패키지를 검색한 후 패키지의 세부 정보를 확인합니다. 해당 정보는 /var/spacewalk/ 아래의 로컬 경로에 표시됩니다. 자동 설치 파일을 추출한 후의 단계는 자동 설치 가능한 배포판을 선언하는 것입니다. 절차: 자동 설치 가능한 배포판 선언 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 자동 설치 배포로 이동합니다. 배포 생성을 클릭하고 다음 필드를 입력합니다. 배포 레이블 필드에서 자동 설치 가능한 배포를 식별할 수 있는 이름을 입력합니다. 트리 경로 필드에서 Uyuni 서버에 저장된 설치 미디어의 경로를 입력합니다. 일치하는 기본 채널을 선택합니다. 설치 미디어와 일치해야 합니다. 설치 프로그램 생성을 선택합니다. 설치 미디어와 일치해야 합니다. 선택 사항: 이 배포를 부팅할 때 사용할 커널 옵션을 지정하십시오. 여러 가지 방식으로 커널 옵션을 제공할 수 있습니다. 배포에 일반적으로 사용되는 옵션만 여기에 추가하십시오. 자동 설치 가능한 배포판 생성을 클릭합니다. 준비한 설치 파일에는 설치에 필요한 패키지가 포함되지 않을 수 있습니다. 포함되지 않은 경우, useonlinerepo=1을 커널 옵션 필드에 추가합니다. 패키지 리포지토리에는 서명되지 않을 수 있는 메타데이터가 포함되어 있습니다. 메타데이터가 서명되지 않은 경우 insecure=1을 커널 옵션 필드에 추가하거나 자체 GPG 키 사용에서의 설명과 같이 자체 GPG 키를 사용합니다. 이러한 커널 옵션은 예를 들어 전체 DVD가 아닌 \"online installer\" ISO 이미지를 사용하거나 tpboot-installation 패키지를 사용할 때 필요합니다. 시스템 자동 설치 배포판으로 이동하여 자동 설치 가능한 배포판을 관리합니다. Uyuni은(는) 사용자가 지정한 커널 옵션을 결합할 수 있습니다. 이 작업은 특별한 상속 논리를 사용하여 수행됩니다. 이와 관련된 세 가지 객체 유형이 있습니다. 배포판(또는 줄임말 \"Distros\") 프로파일 시스템 최종 커널 옵션에 영향을 미치는 네 번째 특수 지점은 Cobbler 설정 파일 /etc/cobbler/settings.yaml입니다. Cobbler 설정 파일은 모든 배포판에 대한 기본 커널 옵션을 정의합니다. 이 옵션은 Uyuni의 컨텍스트에서는 지원되지 않습니다. 커널 옵션을 효과적으로 관리하기 위해서는 원시 값과 확인된 값을 이해하는 것이 중요합니다. 원시 값: 이러한 값은 특정 Cobbler 항목에 직접 연결되어 Cobbler의 내부 데이터베이스에 있는 그대로 저장된 값을 의미합니다. 확인된 값: 이러한 값은 Cobbler 항목의 상속 계층 구조를 고려하여 런타임에 동적으로 생성됩니다. 옵션 앞에 !를 추가하면 최종 커널 명령줄에서 옵션이 제거됩니다. 프로파일과 시스템의 커널 옵션은 둘 다 Uyuni에서 관리됩니다. 따라서 배포판의 커널 옵션만 편집 가능할 수 있습니다. 배포판 원시 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 self_update=0 프로파일 원시 값 console=tty1 시스템 원시 값 console=ttyS0 이 프로파일을 상속하는 시스템의 확인된 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 self_update=0 console=ttyS0 배포판 원시 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 self_update=0 프로파일 원시 값 console=tty1 시스템 원시 값 !self_update 이 프로파일을 상속하는 시스템의 확인된 값 install=http://uyuni.server/ks/dist/SLES15SP4 console=ttyS0","title":"자동 설치 가능한 배포판","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-distributions","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-distributions.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Kickstart를 사용하여 다시 설치할 클라이언트에 사용자 정의 구성 파일이 여러 개 있는 경우 해당 파일을 목록으로 저장하고 사용할 Kickstart 프로파일과 이 목록을 연결할 수 있습니다. 절차: 파일 보관 목록 생성 Uyuni Web UI에서 시스템 자동 설치 파일 보관으로 이동하여 파일 유지 목록 생성을 클릭합니다. 적절한 레이블을 입력하고 저장하려는 모든 파일 및 디렉토리의 절대 경로를 나열합니다. 목록 생성을 클릭합니다. Kickstart 프로파일에 파일 보관 목록을 포함시킵니다. 시스템 자동 설치 프로파일로 이동한 후 편집할 프로파일을 선택하고 시스템 세부 정보 파일 보관 하위 탭으로 이동하여 포함할 파일 보관 목록을 선택합니다. 파일 유지 목록은 전체 크기가 1 MB로 제한됩니다. /dev/hda1 및 /dev/sda1과 같은 특수 장치는 보관할 수 없습니다. 파일 및 디렉토리 이름만 사용하십시오. 정규식 와일드카드는 사용할 수 없습니다. Kickstart에 대한 자세한 설명은 Red Hat 문서를 참조하십시오. 설치 파일의 일부는 설치 중에 대체됩니다. 변수는 단일 값으로 대체되며 코드 조각은 텍스트의 전체 섹션으로 대체됩니다. 이스케이프된 기호 또는 섹션은 대체되지 않습니다. Cheetah라는 템플릿 엔진을 사용하면 Cobbler가 해당 대체를 수행할 수 있습니다. 이 방식을 통해 각각에 대한 프로파일을 수동으로 생성할 필요 없이 대량의 시스템을 다시 설치할 수 있습니다. Uyuni Web UI에서 자동 설치 변수 및 코드 조각을 생성할 수 있습니다. 프로파일의 자동 설치 파일 탭을 사용하면 대체 결과를 확인할 수 있습니다. 변수에 대한 설명은 변수를 참조하십시오. 코드 조각에 대한 설명은 코드 조각을 참조하십시오. 이스케이프 기호 또는 텍스트 블록에 대한 설명은 이스케이핑을 참조하십시오. 자동 설치 변수를 사용해 값을 Kickstart 및 AutoYaST 프로파일로 대신할 수 있습니다. 변수를 정의하려면 프로파일에서 변수 하위 탭으로 이동하여 텍스트 상자에서 name=value 쌍을 생성합니다. 예를 들어, 클라이언트의 IP 주소를 가진 변수와 게이트웨이의 주소를 가진 변수를 생성할 수 있습니다. 그러면 이러한 변수를 동일한 프로파일에서 설치된 모든 클라이언트에 대해 정의할 수 있습니다. 이 작업을 수행하려면 변수 텍스트 상자에 다음 줄을 추가합니다. ipaddr=192.168.0.28 gateway=192.168.0.1 변수를 사용하려면 프로파일에서 $ 기호를 앞에 추가하여 변수를 대체합니다. 예를 들어, Kickstart 파일의 네트워크 부분은 다음과 같습니다. network --bootproto=static --device=eth0 --onboot=on --ip=$ipaddr \\ --gateway=$gateway $ipaddr은 192.168.0.28로, $gateway는 192.168.0.1로 확인됩니다. 설치 파일에서 변수는 계층 구조를 사용합니다. 시스템 변수는 프로파일 변수에 우선하고, 프로파일 변수는 배포 변수에 우선합니다. Uyuni는 미리 정의된 다양한 코드 조각과 함께 제공됩니다. 시스템 자동 설치 자동 설치 조각으로 이동하여 기존 조각의 목록을 확인합니다. 자동 설치 파일에 $SNIPPET() 매크로를 삽입하여 코드 조각을 사용합니다. 예를 들어, Kickstart에서는 다음과 같습니다. $SNIPPET('spacewalk/redhat_register_using_salt') 또는 AutoYaST에서는 다음과 같습니다. <init-scripts config:type=\"list\"> $SNIPPET('spacewalk/minion_script') </init-scripts> 매크로는 Cobbler로 구문 분석되고 코드 조각의 컨텐트로 대체됩니다. 또한 나중에 자동 설치 파일에서 사용할 자체 코드 조각을 저장할 수 있습니다. 조각 생성을 클릭하여 새 코드 조각을 생성하십시오. 다음 예에서는 일반 하드 드라이브 파티션 구성에 대한 Kickstart 코드 조각을 다음과 같이 설정합니다. clearpart --all part /boot --fstype ext3 --size=150 --asprimary part / --fstype ext3 --size=40000 --asprimary part swap --recommended part pv.00 --size=1 --grow volgroup vg00 pv.00 logvol /var --name=var vgname=vg00 --fstype ext3 --size=5000 예를 들어, 다음과 같이 코드 조각을 사용합니다. $SNIPPET('my_partition') 자동 설치 파일에 $(example)와(과) 같은 셸 스크립트 변수가 포함된 경우 백슬래시를 사용하여 컨텐트를 이스케이프해야 합니다. \\$(example). $ 기호를 이스케이프하면 템플릿 엔진이 기호를 내부 변수로 평가하지 못하게 됩니다. 코드 조각이나 스크립트와 같은 텍스트 블록은 \\#raw 및 \\#end raw 지시어로 래핑하여 이스케이프할 수 있습니다. 예: #raw #!/bin/bash for i in {0..2}; do echo \"$i - Hello World!\" done #end raw # 기호 다음에 공백이 있는 모든 줄은 주석으로 취급되므로 평가되지 않습니다. 예: # 특정 섹션 시작(주석임) echo \"Hello, world\" # 특정 섹션 종료(주석임)","title":"자동 설치 프로파일","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"autoinst-profiles","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/autoinst-profiles.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 프로파일 선언","hash":"declare-profile","id":1},{"text":"2.

You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Debian 채널은 규모가 매우 클 수 있습니다. 때로 동기화에 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. 클라이언트는 소프트웨어 패키지가 설치되기 전에 GPG 키를 사용해 신뢰성을 확인합니다. 신뢰할 수 있는 소프트웨어만 클라이언트에 설치할 수 있습니다. 클라이언트의 보안을 위해 GPG 키를 신뢰하는 것이 중요합니다. 어떤 키가 필요하고 신뢰할 수 있는지 결정하는 것은 관리자가 수행해야 하는 작업입니다. GPG 키를 신뢰할 수 없는 경우 소프트웨어 채널을 사용할 수 없기 때문에 채널을 클라이언트에 할당하는 결정은 키를 신뢰하는 결정에 따라 달라집니다. GPG 키에 대한 자세한 내용은 GPG 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Debian 클라이언트를 설치하려면 여러 개의 GPG 키가 필요할 수 있습니다. 타사 Debian 리포지토리를 동기화하는 경우 서버에서 적절한 GPG 키를 가져와야 합니다. GPG 키가 누락되면 동기화에 실패합니다. Debian 리포지토리의 경우, 메타데이터만 서명됩니다. 그러므로 소프트웨어 채널용 GPG 키를 가져올 필요가 없습니다. Uyuni는 패키지에 다시 서명하지 않습니다. Uyuni 서버로 이미 임포트한 GPG 키를 살펴보려면 다음 명령을 실행합니다. mgrctl exec -- gpg --homedir /var/lib/spacewalk/gpgdir --list-keys 새 GPG 키를 임포트하려면 다음 명령을 실행합니다. mgradm gpg add <filename>.gpg Debian의 루트 사용자는 SSH 액세스에 대해 기본적으로 비활성화되어 있습니다. 일반 사용자를 사용하여 온보딩하려면 sudoers 파일을 편집해야 합니다. 절차: 루트 사용자에게 액세스 권한 부여 클라이언트에서 다음과 같이 sudoers 파일을 편집합니다. sudo visudo 이 줄을 sudoers 파일 끝에 추가하여 사용자에게 sudo 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 다음과 같이 <user>를 Web UI에서 클라이언트를 부트스트래핑하고 있는 사용자의 이름으로 교체합니다. <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 이 절차는 클라이언트 등록에 필요한 비밀번호가 없어도 루트에 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 클라이언트는 성공적으로 설치된 후 루트 권한으로 실행되므로 액세스 권한이 더 이상 필요 없습니다. 클라이언트가 성공적으로 설치된 후 sudoers 파일에서 이 줄을 제거하는 것이 좋습니다.

GPG 키 정보가 있는 소프트웨어 채널이 클라이언트에 할당되면 채널을 새로 고치거나 이 채널에서 첫 번째 패키지를 설치할 때 키가 신뢰됩니다. 소프트웨어 채널 페이지의 GPG 키 URL 파라미터에는 \"공백\"으로 구분된 여러 키 URL이 포함될 수 있습니다. 파일 URL인 경우 클라이언트에 GPG 키 파일을 배포한 후 소프트웨어 채널을 사용해야 합니다. Red Hat 기반 클라이언트의 클라이언트 도구 채널에 대한 GPG 키는 클라이언트의 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/에 배포되며 파일 URL로 참조할 수 있습니다. 소프트웨어 채널이 클라이언트에 할당된 경우에만 시스템에서 가져와서 신뢰하게 됩니다. Debian 기반 시스템은 메타데이터에만 서명하므로 단일 채널에 대해 추가 키를 지정할 필요가 없습니다. 리포지토리 메타데이터에서 \"자체 GPG 키 사용\"의 설명과 같이 사용자가 자체 GPG 키를 구성하여 메타데이터에 서명하는 경우 해당 키의 배포 및 신뢰가 자동으로 실행됩니다. 사용자는 클라이언트에 배포할 사용자 정의 GPG 키를 정의할 수 있습니다. 일부 열 데이터를 제공하고 Salt 파일 시스템에 GPG 키 파일을 제공하면 클라이언트에 자동으로 배포됩니다. 이러한 키는 RPM 기반 운영 체제의 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/및 Debian 시스템의 /usr/share/keyrings/에 배포됩니다. 키를 배포할 클라이언트에 대한 열 키 custom_gpgkeys를 정의하고 키 파일의 이름을 나열합니다. cat /srv/pillar/mypillar.sls custom_gpgkeys: - my_first_gpg.key - my_second_gpgkey.gpg 추가적으로 Salt 파일 시스템에서 gpg 디렉토리를 생성한 후 해당 디렉토리에 custom_gpgkeys 열 데이터에 지정된 이름으로 GPG 키 파일을 저장합니다. ls -la /srv/salt/gpg/ /srv/salt/gpg/my_first_gpg.key /srv/salt/gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg 키는 클라이언트에 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_first_gpg.key 및 /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/my_second_gpgkey.gpg에 배포됩니다. 마지막 단계로 소프트웨어 채널의 GPG 키 URL 필드에 URL을 추가합니다. 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동하고 수정할 채널을 선택합니다.

SLE Micro 클라이언트는 등록 후 재부팅해야 합니다. 부트스트랩 프로세스 후에는 SLE Micro 클라이언트에서 자동 부팅이 비활성화됩니다. 이 변경 사항은 간헐적인 자동 재부팅으로 인해 구현되었으며, 이는 부트스트랩 Salt 상태가 적용된 결과를 전달하기 전에 발생할 수 있습니다. 등록이 완료되면 재부팅이 자동으로 예약되지만, 기본 재부팅 관리자 유지보수 기간이 적용됩니다. 이 기간은 클라이언트가 등록되고 몇 시간이 지난 후가 될 수 있습니다. 등록 스크립트가 완료된 후 등록 속도를 향상하고 시스템이 시스템 목록에 표시되도록 하려면 클라이언트를 수동으로 재부팅하는 것이 좋습니다. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products.

The procedure shown here can be used to circumvent the subscription limitations - however, this constitutes a breach of the Terms of Service and may have legal consequences. There must always be sufficient subscriptions for the number of systems used. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Web UI Uyuni Web UI에서 소프트웨어 관리 채널로 이동한 다음, 리포지토리에 연결된 채널을 클릭합니다. 리포지토리 탭으로 이동한 다음, 동기화를 클릭하고 동기화 상태를 확인합니다. Procedure: Checking Synchronization Progress From the Command Prompt At the command prompt on the Uyuni container host, as root, check the synchronization log file: mgrctl exec -ti -- tail -f /var/log/rhn/reposync/<channel-label>.log Each child channel generates its own log during the synchronization progress. You need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. Ubuntu 채널은 규모가 매우 클 수 있습니다. 때로 동기화에 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. 클라이언트는 소프트웨어 패키지가 설치되기 전에 GPG 키를 사용해 신뢰성을 확인합니다. 신뢰할 수 있는 소프트웨어만 클라이언트에 설치할 수 있습니다. 클라이언트의 보안을 위해 GPG 키를 신뢰하는 것이 중요합니다. 어떤 키가 필요하고 신뢰할 수 있는지 결정하는 것은 관리자가 수행해야 하는 작업입니다. GPG 키를 신뢰할 수 없는 경우 소프트웨어 채널을 사용할 수 없기 때문에 채널을 클라이언트에 할당하는 결정은 키를 신뢰하는 결정에 따라 달라집니다. GPG 키에 대한 자세한 내용은 GPG 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Ubuntu의 루트 사용자는 SSH 액세스에 대해 기본적으로 비활성화되어 있습니다. 일반 사용자를 사용하여 온보딩하려면 sudoers 파일을 편집해야 합니다. 이 문제는 Ubuntu의 자체 설치 버전에서 발생합니다. 설치 중에 기본 사용자에게 관리자 권한이 부여된 경우 sudo를 사용하여 권한 에스컬레이션을 수행하려면 비밀번호가 필요합니다. 클라우드 인스턴스에서는 이런 일이 발생하지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 cloud-init는 /etc/sudoers.d 아래에 자동으로 파일을 생성하고 비밀번호를 사용할 필요 없이 sudo를 사용하여 권한 에스컬레이션을 부여하기 때문입니다. 절차: 루트 사용자에게 액세스 권한 부여 클라이언트에서 다음과 같이 sudoers 파일을 편집합니다. sudo visudo 이 줄을 sudoers 파일 끝에 추가하여 사용자에게 sudo 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 다음과 같이 <user>를 Web UI에서 클라이언트를 부트스트래핑하고 있는 사용자의 이름으로 교체합니다. <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 이 절차는 클라이언트 등록에 필요한 비밀번호가 없어도 루트에 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 클라이언트는 성공적으로 설치된 후 루트 권한으로 실행되므로 액세스 권한이 더 이상 필요 없습니다. 클라이언트가 성공적으로 설치된 후 sudoers 파일에서 이 줄을 제거하는 것이 좋습니다. To bootstrap an Ubuntu client via SSH you must add the install-created user to the sudo group. Then run the bootstrap script from the client.

It cannot be bootstrapped via the Uyuni Web UI due to the fact that the root user is disabled on Ubuntu by default, and that the Web UI does not permit for privilege escalation of the Ubuntu install-created user. To register your clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt on the container host: mgrctl exec -ti mgr-create-bootstrap-repo 클라이언트 등록에 대한 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 참조하십시오.","title":"Registering Ubuntu Clients","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"clients-ubuntu","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/clients-ubuntu.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 소프트웨어 채널 추가","hash":"_소프트웨어_채널_추가","id":1},{"text":"2.

Uyuni Salt Master가 아닌 Salt Master에 연결된 Salt Minion을 실행하는 시스템에서도 Salt 번들을 사용할 수 있습니다. The registration method with the Salt Bundle is the recommended registration method. This section explains the advantages and limitations of the current implementation. The Salt Bundle is provided as the venv-salt-minion package that consists of Salt, Python 3, and the Python modules Salt depends on. Bootstrapping with Web UI is using Salt Bundle as well, so bootstrapping with Web UI is not Python dependant. Using the Salt Bundle, it is no longer needed that the client provides any Python interpreter or modules. 새 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하는 경우 Salt Bundle에 등록하는 것이 기본 방법입니다. 기존 클라이언트를 Salt Bundle 방식으로 전환할 수 있습니다. 전환하면 salt-minion 패키지와 종속 항목이 설치된 상태로 유지됩니다. Salt 번들은 Salt와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다. 미니언이 관리하는 Salt Master 이외의 Uyuni 서버에서 동시에 사용할 수 있습니다. Salt 번들을 클라이언트에 설치한 경우 Uyuni 서버가 Salt 번들의 구성 파일을 관리하게 되며, 이 경우 salt-minion의 구성 파일은 관리되지 않습니다. 자세한 내용은 Salt 번들 구성에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Uyuni 서버가 아닌 Salt Master가 관리하는 Salt 미니언을 사용하여 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하려면 클라이언트를 Salt로 부트스트랩하려면 부트스트랩 스크립트 생성 시 mgr-bootstrap --force-bundle을 사용하거나 부트스트랩 스크립트에서 FORCE_VENV_SALT_MINION을 1로 설정하는 것이 좋습니다. Web UI mgr_force_venv_salt_minion이 true로 설정된 부트스트래핑의 경우 열을 전역적으로 지정할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 Salt States and Pillars에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Salt 상태 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 사용하여 salt-minion에서 venv-salt-minion으로 전환할 수 있습니다. 프로세스 이동 문제를 방지하려면 두 단계에 걸쳐 venv-salt-minion으로 전환하는 것이 좋습니다. Procedure: SwitchingWwith util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion State to venv-salt-minion 우선 열을 지정하지 않고 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 적용하십시오. 그러면 구성 파일 등을 복사하는 venv-salt-minion으로 전환됩니다. 원래 salt-minion 구성 및 해당 패키지는 정리되지 않습니다. salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion mgr_purge_non_venv_salt가 True로 설정된 util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion을 적용하여 salt-minion을 제거하고 mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files을 True로 설정하여 salt-minion과 관련된 모든 파일을 제거하십시오. 이 두 번째 단계는 첫 번째 단계가 처리되었는지 확인한 후 이전 구성 파일과 더 이상 사용되지 않는 salt-minion 패키지를 제거합니다. salt <minion_id> state.apply util.mgr_switch_to_venv_minion pillar='{\"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt_files\": True, \"mgr_purge_non_venv_salt\": True}' In case of running the second step only and the first step, state apply process could fail as it requires stopping the salt-minion which is used to execute the command on the client side. It is also possible to avoid installing the Salt Bundle and keep using salt-minion instead. In this case, specify one of these options: --no-bundle 옵션으로 mgr-bootstrap을 실행하십시오. 생성된 부트스트랩 스크립트에서 AVOID_VENV_SALT_MINION을 1로 설정합니다. 부트스트랩 상태에 대하여 mgr_avoid_venv_salt_minion 열을 True로 설정합니다. Salt 번들은 클라이언트로 SSH Push 작업을 수행할 때도 사용됩니다. 셸 스크립트는 Salt 명령이 실행되기 전에 venv-salt-minion을 설치하지 않고 대상 시스템에 Salt 번들을 배포합니다. Salt 번들에는 전체 Salt 코드 베이스가 포함되어 있으므로 salt-thin은 배포되지 않습니다. SSH Push(Web UI를 사용한 부트스트랩 포함)는 번들 내의 Python 3 인터프리터를 사용합니다. 대상 시스템에는 다른 Python 인터프리터가 설치되어 있지 않아도 됩니다. 번들과 함께 배포된 Python 3은 클라이언트에서 SSH Push 세션을 처리하는 데 사용되므로 SSH Push(Web UI를 사용한 부트스트랩 포함)는 시스템에 설치된 Python에 종속되지 않습니다. 다른 방법으로 salt-thin을 사용할 수 있지만, 클라이언트에 Python 3이 설치되어 있어야 합니다. 이 방법은 권장되거나 지원되지 않으며 개발 목적으로만 존재합니다. web.ssh_use_salt_thin을 /etc/rhn/rhn.conf 구성 파일에서 true로 설정합니다. 부트스트랩 리포지토리는 Web UI를 사용하여 클라이언트를 부트스트랩하기 전에 생성해야 합니다. SSH Push는 감지된 대상 운영 체제를 기반으로 부트스트랩 리포지토리에서 가져온 Salt 번들을 사용합니다. 자세한 내용은 client-configuration:bootstrap-repository.adoc#_prepare_to_create_a_bootstrap_repository에서 확인할 수 있습니다. SSH Push는 /var/tmp를 사용하여 번들된 Python을 사용하여 클라이언트에서 Salt 명령을 실행하기 위해 Salt 번들을 배포합니다. 따라서 noexec 옵션으로 /var/tmp를 마운트하지 않아야 합니다. noexec 옵션을 사용하여 /var/tmp가 마운트된 클라이언트는 부트스트랩 프로세스가 SSH Push를 사용하여 클라이언트에 도달하기 때문에 Web UI를 사용하여 부트스트랩할 수 없습니다. Salt 번들에는 pip이 포함되어 있어 번들된 Salt 미니언의 기능을 추가 Python 패키지로 확장할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 salt <minion_id> pip.install <package-name> 은 <package_name>에 의해 지정된 Python 패키지를 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local에 설치합니다. 필요한 경우 /var/lib/venv-salt-minion/local 경로는 venv-salt-minion.service에 대한 VENV_PIP_TARGET 환경 변수를 설정하여 재정의할 수 있습니다. 서비스에 대한 systemd drop-in 구성 파일을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 이는 구성 파일 /etc/systemd/system/venv-salt-minion.service.d/10-pip-destination.conf를 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다. [Service] Environment=VENV_PIP_TARGET=/new/path/local/venv-salt-minion/pip pip을 사용하여 설치된 Python 패키지는 Salt 번들을 업데이트할 때 변경되지 않습니다. 업데이트 후에도 해당 패키지를 사용할 수 있고 정상적으로 작동하도록 하려면 Salt 번들 업데이트 후 Salt 상태를 적용하여 설치하는 것이 좋습니다.","title":"Salt Bundle","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"contact-methods-saltbundle","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/contact-methods-saltbundle.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

SSH를 통해 시스템을 완전히 관리 확인란을 선택합니다. 부트스트랩을 클릭하여 등록을 시작합니다. 시스템 개요로 이동하여 시스템이 올바르게 등록되었는지 확인합니다. 예: SSH를 통한 푸시에 대한 API 액세스 API를 사용해 어떤 연결 방법을 사용할지 관리할 수 있습니다. 다음 Python 코드 예제에서는 연결 방법을 ssh-push로 설정합니다. 유효한 값은 다음과 같습니다. default(풀) ssh-push ssh-push-tunnel client = xmlrpclib.Server(MLM_HOST + \"/rpc/api\", verbose=0) key = client.auth.login(MLM_LOGIN, MLM_PASSWORD) client.system.setDetails(key, 1000012345, {'contact_method' : 'ssh-push'}) SSH Push를 구성할 때 호스트, 활성화 키, 비밀번호 등 시스템의 등록 시에 사용되는 파라미터를 수정할 수 있습니다. 비밀번호는 부트스트랩에만 사용되며 어디에도 저장되지 않습니다. 향후 모든 SSH 세션은 키/인증서 쌍을 통해 인증됩니다. 이러한 파라미터는 시스템 부트스트래핑에서 구성할 수 있습니다. 또한 시스템 전체에 사용되는 영구 파라미터를 구성할 수 있으며, sudo 사용자가 루트 대신 권한 없는 사용자로 시스템에 액세스하도록 설정할 수도 있습니다. Use mgrctl term before running steps inside the server container. 절차: 권한 없는 SSH 액세스 구성 Uyuni 서버에 최신 spacewalk-taskomatic 및 spacewalk-certs-tools 패키지가 설치되어 있는지 확인합니다. 각 클라이언트 시스템에서 적절한 권한 없는 사용자를 생성합니다. 각 클라이언트에서 다음과 같이 sudoers 파일을 편집합니다. sudo visudo 이 줄을 sudoers 파일 끝에 추가하여 사용자에게 sudo 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 다음과 같이 <user>를 Web UI에서 클라이언트를 부트스트래핑하고 있는 사용자의 이름으로 교체합니다. <user> ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3, /var/tmp/venv-salt-minion/bin/python 이 절차는 클라이언트 등록에 필요한 비밀번호가 없어도 루트에 액세스 권한을 부여합니다. 클라이언트는 성공적으로 설치된 후 루트 권한으로 실행되므로 액세스 권한이 더 이상 필요 없습니다. 클라이언트가 성공적으로 설치된 후 sudoers 파일에서 이 줄을 제거하는 것이 좋습니다. Inside the Uyuni Server container, edit the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file, and add or amend this line to include the unprivileged username: ssh_push_sudo_user = <user> After changing this configuration parameter you must restart services such as salt-secrets-config.service, tomcat.service, and taskomatic.service. To cover all needed services, it is the best to restart the Uyuni Server as root. Outside of the container, from the container host, enter: mgradm restart SSH Push 기능은 taskomatic을 사용하여 salt-ssh를 수행해 예약된 작업을 실행합니다. taskomatic 작업은 주기적으로 예약된 작업을 확인하고 실행합니다. SSH Push 기능은 예약된 작업을 기반으로 완전한 salt-ssh 호출을 실행합니다. 기본적으로 한 번에 20건의 Salt SSH 작업을 실행할 수 있습니다. 구성 파일에 다음과 같은 줄을 추가하고 parallel_threads의 값을 상향 조정하여 병렬로 실행할 수 있는 작업의 수를 늘릴 수 있습니다. 문제를 방지하기 위해 병렬 작업의 수를 다음과 같이 낮게 유지하는 것이 좋습니다. taskomatic.sshminion_action_executor.parallel_threads = <number> org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount = <value of parallel_threads + 20> 이렇게 하여 어느 한 곳의 클라이언트에서 병렬로 실행할 수 있는 작업의 수와 Taskomatic이 사용하는 작업자 스레드의 총 개수를 조정할 수 있습니다. 작업을 여러 클라이언트에서 실행해야 하는 경우 작업은 항상 각 클라이언트에서 순차적으로 실행됩니다. 클라이언트가 프록시를 통해 연결되어 있는 경우 프록시에서 MaxSessions 설정을 조정해야 합니다. 이 경우 병렬 연결의 수를 클라이언트 총 수의 세 배로 설정합니다. SSH Push를 통한 푸시에서는 아직 지원하지 않는 몇 가지 기능이 있습니다. 다음 기능은 Salt SSH 클라이언트에서 작동하지 않습니다. OpenSCAP 감사 Beacons, 이로 인해 zypper를 사용해 시스템에 패키지를 설치해도 패키지 새로 고침이 호출되지 않습니다. 가상 호스트 기능(예: 게스트에 대한 호스트)은 가상 호스트 시스템이 Salt SSH 기반인 경우 작동하지 않습니다.

You can view orphaned packages in the Web UI by clicking Software Manage Packages view Packages in no channel. Uyuni periodically runs a taskomatic job that searches for orphaned packages and modifies the package organization ID to 1. This means that you can delete orphaned packages only after the taskomatic job execution. If you encounter an orphaned package that you cannot delete, wait 24 hours and try the deletion again. Delete orphaned packages: with command line tools targeting individual packages.

If you check this option, the client is configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other contact method is configured. For more information about contact methods, see 클라이언트 연락 방법. 부트스트랩을 클릭하여 등록을 시작합니다. 부트스트랩 프로세스가 완료되면 클라이언트가 시스템 시스템 목록에 나열됩니다. SSH 개인 키는 부트스트래핑 프로세스가 진행되는 중에만 저장되며, 부트스트래핑이 완료되자마자 Uyuni 서버에서 삭제됩니다. Uyuni를 사용해 클라이언트에 새 패키지 또는 업데이트를 설치하면 최종 사용자 라이선스 계약(EULA)이 자동으로 수락됩니다. 패키지 EULA를 검토하려면 Web UI에서 패키지 상세 정보 페이지를 여십시오. Uyuni에서 제공하지 않는 클라이언트에 리포지토리를 직접 할당하는 것은 일반적인 사용 사례가 아닙니다. 이로 인해 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 그러므로 Salt를 통한 부트스트래핑은 부트스트랩 프로세스를 시작할 때 모든 로컬 리포지토리를 비활성화합니다. 나중에 Highstate 또는 패키지 설치를 실행할 때처럼 채널 상태를 사용할 때마다 로컬에 할당된 모든 리포지토리가 다시 비활성화됩니다. 클라이언트에서 사용되는 모든 소프트웨어 패키지는 Uyuni에서 제공하는 채널에서 가져와야 합니다. 사용자 정의 채널을 생성하는 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 사용자 정의 채널에서 사용자 정의 채널을 참조하십시오.","title":"Register Clients With the Web UI","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"registration-webui","url":"/uyuni/client-configuration/registration-webui.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This workflow shows you how to set up your Uyuni Server to manage a new client, set up the software channels you need, and bootstrap the client using an activation key. This workflow shows you how to onboard a client to your Uyuni Server. The client must be running a supported Linux operating system. For a list of supported client systems, see 지원되는 클라이언트 및 기능. This is one of the first tasks you need to do when you set up Uyuni for the first time, and you will probably have to do it many more times as you use the product. When you have completed this workflow, your client is onboarded, and it can be seen in the systems list of the Uyuni Web UI. You can then use Uyuni to manage the client. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. This workflow uses a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 operating system. You can use other Linux operating systems, but some of the steps might be different. For more information on onboarding other clients, see 등록 방법. Procedure: Configure a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) on Your Client On the client, at the command prompt, show the current hostname: hostname -f This command will probably return an error, or show something like localhost. Set a new hostname. Your new hostname should have a subdomain name and thus include at least two periods. In this example, we are using client1.MLM.example hostnamectl set-hostname client1.MLM.example Check that your change was successful: hostnamectl Open YaST and navigate to Network Services Hostnames. Edit the hostname to match the one you just set, and click OK. In YaST, navigate to System Network Settings and go to the Hostname/DNS tab. In the Static hostname field, type your new hostmame. Check that the change was successful: hostname -f This command should return your new FQDN. Procedure: Prepare Software Channels on the Uyuni Server In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Admin Setup Wizard. In the Organization Credentials tab, ensure you have entered your SUSE Customer Center credentials, and are correctly authenticated. In the Products tab, ensure that the product catalog is fully updated: Use the product search bar to find the channels you need for your client operating system. Check the channels you want to install, and click Add products: Wait for the product channels to fully synchronize. Depending on the products you have chosen, this could take a long time. Procedure: Create an Activation Key In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Activation Keys, and click Create Key. Give your activation key a name, and select the base channel that matches the client you want to onboard. This should be the product you just enabled: Check the child channels to include, and any add-on system types you want clients registered with this key to have. Click Create Activation Key. Procedure: Bootstrap the Client In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Type the hostname and provide authentication credentials for the client you want to onboard, and select the activation key. Click Bootstrap: Navigate to Systems System List to manage your new client.

Automated update of clients is benefitial when: update of a large number of clients is wanted the workflow should not be re-done every execution a dedicated maintenance window exists. Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent and supportable state. Before you start, you should have a number of clients onboarded. It may make sense to have them sorted into groups you want to update together. In this workflow we use a system group named infra-services. To update a client two steps are required. A third step is optional but highly recommended to finalize the update process. Procedure 1: Creating a Recurring Action to Update Salt Itself As an example, we create the action to update Salt itself as a recurring action for all systems in the organization. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Home My Organization Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like update-salt. Select a schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:00 am . Assign the update-salt state by selecting the checkbox. Click Save Changes to save the action. You can edit the execution order of the states if needed. Click Confirm to confirm the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 2: Creating a Recurring Action to Apply All Available Updates to the Systems As an example we create the action to apply all updates as a recurring action for a system group called infra-services. In the Uyuni Web UI go to Systems System Groups and click on infra-services. Now go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Custom State and enter a Schedule Name like full-system-update. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 9:30 am . Keep enough time between this action and the update-salt action. The update-salt actions must be finished on all systems before this action should be executed. Assign the states util.syncall, certs, channels and uptodate by selecting the checkboxes. To perform a reboot afterwards you can also add reboot or rebootifneeded. Save the action by clicking Save Changes. You can edit the execution order of the states. The order should be util.syncall, certs, channels, uptodate and finally reboot or rebootifneeded if chosen. Click Confirm to store the order. Click Create Schedule to save the action. Procedure 4: Creating a Recurring Action to Run a Highstate After the Update As an example, we create the action to apply the highstate for the same group which was fully updated before. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups and click infra-services. Go to Recurring Actions and click Create. Select Action Type Highstate and enter a Schedule Name like highstate. Select a Schedule. For example, Weekly: Wednesday, 10:30 am . Again, keep enough time between this action and the full-system-update action. Click Create Schedule to save the action. The uptodate state applies critical patches to the update components. On SUSE-based systems, the state executes the command: zypper --non-interactive patch --updatestack-only And then, the state also updates Salt. On all the other systems, not based on SUSE, the state only updates Salt. The state runs the package manager, such as dnf, yum, apt, or zypper based on what is available on the client operating system to update the rest of the packages. The state lists all of the upgradable packages, based on the synchronized package repositories in Uyuni. The state upgrades the packages to their latest available version by using the client’s package manager. The executed command depends on the operating system of the client: For Debian-based clients, such as Debian or Ubuntu, the action executes apt dist-upgrade -q -y $PACKAGES. For RPM-based clients that are not SUSE, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Liberty Linux, the action executes yum --quiet -y update $PACKAGES or dnf --quiet -y upgrade $PACKAGES (depending on the package manager the client is using). For non-transactional SUSE clients, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, the action executes zypper --non-interactive --auto-agree-with-licenses update $PACKAGES. For transactional SUSE clients, the action executes the same in a transactional shell. Uyuni provides the reboot and rebootifneeded actions.

This workflow shows you how to use the Uyuni Web UI to create a centrally managed configuration file, assign it to a client, and apply the configuration. If you are managing a lot of clients, you probably do not want to manually apply configuration settings to each of them in turn. Configuration channels are used to organize configuration files. You can subscribe clients to configuration channels, and deploy configuration files as required. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a configuration channel containing a configuration file, have assigned clients to the channel, and applied the configuration successfully. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server installed, that you can access using the Web UI. At least one client registered to your server.

CLM allows you to customize and test packages before updating production clients. It is also useful if you need to apply updates during a limited maintenance window. Content lifecycle management allows you to select software channels as sources, adjust them as required for your environment, and thoroughly test them before installing onto your production clients. You can use CLM to manage your software channels from development, through testing, and rolling the changes out to your clients. When you have completed this workflow, you will have a content lifecycle project set up. You will have created a basic CLM project, and promoted it through its lifecycle. Before you start, you should already have: Uyuni Server deployed, and accessible using the Web UI. Client machine with an operating system installed, which you can access across the network that your Uyuni Server is on, using SSH. Appropriate subscriptions from http://scc.suse.com for the products you are using. Procedure: Create a new CLM Project In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Content Lifecycle Projects section, and click Create Project. Type a name, label, and description for your project, and click Create. In the Sources section, click Attach/Detach Sources. Select the source type, and select a base channel for your project.

Click Build to build version 1 of your project: Procedure: Assign Clients Navigate to Systems System List, select the client to assign, and go to the Software Software Channels tab. In the Base Channel section, select the CLM project and environment you want to assign the client to. For example, if you want this client to receive updates from your CLM only when packages are in the production environment, assign the base channel <CLM_Project_Name>-production-<Channel_Name>. Alternatively, you could use this client as a way to test if your CLM packages are working as expected before you promote them to development, so you assign the base channel <CLM_Project_Name>-testing-<Channel_Name>.

In-place migration is benefitial when: migrating large number of the older SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is time-consuming you are looking for a way to automate migrations Successful completion of this workflow results in consistent, supportable outcomes. This workflow is complex and time-consuming. Make sure that adequate testing is done before deploying the procedure in live environment. Procedure: Prepare the Uyuni Server for Provisioning Create a Uyuni Content Lifecycle Management project for your distribution. Choose a short-but-descriptive prefix in the name, including all source channel modules. Add Filters as needed. Add at least one Environment. Create an Activation Key that includes the filtered project channels. (Optional) Create a bootstrap script. The profile will not need it, because it is managed in the AutoYaST. Create a /var/spacewalk/iso directory, and for SLES 15 SP2 and following, copy the Full iso (>10 GB) there. Create a mount point for it, such as /opt/install/15sp3 and mount the ISO there. Ensure this path gets re-mounted at boot time. Create an Autoinstallation Distribution in Uyuni for each base channel to which you will migrate. In the Distribution, reference the specific Base Channel to match the base to which you might migrate, for example the base channel of your CLM project Environment Lifecycle. Label the Distribution something that references your specific Base Channel. Set the Installer Generation to match your specific version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (12, 15, etc.). The kernel options will be automatically populated when you click Create Autoinstallable Distribution. You may create more Distributions depending on the Base Channel you need to assign, and you can re-use the same Tree Path for the boot media if required. Click on Profiles, and upload Kickstart/AutoYaST file for each target SUSE Linux Enterprise Server distribution, service pack and channels you wish to migrate to. This profile will be associated with the activation key and autoinstallation distribution created above. Cut-and-paste a Profile template as the basis for what you upload, assign it the Autoinstall tree you created as a Distribution above. Do not put anything in the Virtualizaton Type box, and click Create. Once created, your profile will now have some new fields on this Details page. In the Kernel Options line on this Details page, put in autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo This will tell your profile to treat its install as an upgrade, and allow http access to the Uyuni Server to obtain installer updates without needing to go to SUSE Customer Center. Click the variables tab in your Autoinstallation Profile to specify CLM prefix, Activation Key, Distribution tree, and Organization: Sample Variables: registration_key=1-15sp1-demo-test org=1 channel_prefix=15sp1-demo-test distrotree=15sp1-demo-test Edit the AutoYaST profile itself in a tool where you can use cut-and-paste for the channels in your profile. Use variables in your profiles where possible. Published profiles can be used as a starting point. For profile files, see https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles. The profiles follow AutoYaST XML guidelines, and for an in-place upgrade there are several important sections: Add-ons - the repositories used in the upgrade <listentry> <ask_on_error config:type=\"boolean\">true</ask_on_error> #if $channel_prefix != \"\" <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/$channel_prefix-sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #else <media_url>https://$redhat_management_server/ks/dist/child/sle-manager-tools15-pool-$arch-sp3/$distrotree</media_url> #end if <name>$channel_prefix SLE-15-Manager-Tools Pool</name> <product>sle-manager-tools</product> </listentry> Be sure to include all (and only) the relevant modules (both Pool and Updates) to be used in the migration. In migration, it is recommended to add all available modules, as the location of certain packages changes with new major versions. After finishing the preparation, proceed with the actual migration. Procedure: Migrating Clients Prior to migration, be sure to check Software → Non-Compliant. This will show any orphaned packages on your system - those Uyuni does not find in any assigned channel. Make sure this list is very small or empty, and that you can account for all the packages there. Delete any that are unnecessary. + . Before provisioning, issue the following Remote Command to the systems you wish to upgrade to remove the existing Uyuni channels during the upgrade process: + rm -rf /etc/zypp/repos.d/susemanager* + . Assign your Autoinstallation Profile in System Details → Provisioning for one system, or in the Provisioning tab in SSM for as many systems as you need. Uyuni provisioning then auto-assigns a Reactivation Key to this system, that is referenced in the provisioning process. If you need to perform the upgrade through a particular Uyuni Proxy you will need to group just those systems together in SSM. + image::wf-inplaceMigration-06.png[scaledwidth=80%] + image::wf-inplaceMigration-07.png[scaledwidth=80%] Uyuni creates the proper entry in /etc/grub.d/ for the reinstallation, and boots the selected systems to that entry. The Profile you created above will be used to drive automated upgrade, following which your system will use the reactivation key (one time), associating the upgraded system with the previous Uyuni profile. The Session Status screen in Uyuni will not be updated real-time. Instead, watch the target system console to track progress. If you are updating an instance on a hyperscaler like AWS you may be able to get screenshots of the console.","title":"In-place Upgrade of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with Uyuni","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade","url":"/uyuni/common-workflows/workflow-inplace-sles-upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.

A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition.

You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.

Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—​for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.

PAYG(으)로 제공되는 제품을 위한 영역별 RMT 서버 미러링 리포지토리를 운영합니다. This document describes how to connect existing PAYG instance to Uyuni server, and gives basic information about credentials collection from the instance. The goal of this connection is to extract authentication data so the Uyuni Server can connect to a cloud RMT host. Then the Uyuni Server has access to products on the RMT host that are not already available with the SUSE Customer Center organization credentials. PAYG 기능 사용 전 확인 사항: 원하는 리포지토리에 액세스할 수 있도록 올바른 SUSE 제품 이미지(예: SLES, SLES for SAP 또는 SLE HPC)에서 PAYG 인스턴스가 시작됩니다. Uyuni 서버는 직접 또는 배스천을 통해 PAYG 인스턴스(이상적으로는 동일한 영역에 위치)에 연결됩니다. A basic SUSE Customer Center account is required. Enter your valid SUSE Customer Center credentials in Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials. This account is required for accessing the Uyuni client tools for boostrapping regardless of PAYG instances. If you bootstrap the PAYG instance to Uyuni, Uyuni will disable its PAYG repositories then add repositories from where it mirrored the data from the RMT server. The final result will be PAYG instances acquiring the same repositories from the RMT servers but through the Uyuni server itself. Of course repositories can still be setup primarily from SCC. Procedure: Connecting New PAYG Instance Uyuni Web UI에서 관리 설치 마법사 PAYG으로 이동하고 PAYG 추가를 클릭합니다. 페이지 섹션 PAYG 연결 설명으로 시작하십시오. 설명 필드에 설명을 추가합니다. 인스턴스 SSH 연결 데이터 페이지 섹션으로 이동합니다. 호스트 필드에 Uyuni에서 연결할 인스턴스 DNS 또는 IP 주소를 입력합니다. SSH 포트 필드에 포트 번호를 입력하거나 기본값 22를 사용합니다. 사용자 필드에 클라우드에 지정된 대로 사용자 이름을 입력합니다. 암호 필드에 암호를 입력합니다. SSH 개인 키 필드에 인스턴스 키를 입력합니다. SSH 개인 키 암호 문구 필드에 키 암호 문구를 입력합니다. 인증 키는 항상 PEM 형식이어야 합니다. 인스턴스에 직접 연결하지 않고 SSH 배스천을 통해 연결하는 경우 절차: SSH 배스천 연결 데이터 추가를 진행합니다. 그 외의 경우, [proc-finishing-rhui-connecting]를 진행합니다. 절차: SSH 배스천 연결 데이터 추가 SSH 배스천 연결 데이터 페이지 섹션으로 이동합니다. 호스트 필드에 배스천 호스트 이름을 입력합니다. SSH 포트 필드에 배스천 포트 번호를 입력합니다. 사용자 필드에 배스천 사용자 이름을 입력합니다. 암호 필드에 배스천 암호를 입력합니다. SSH 개인 키 필드에 배스천 키를 입력합니다. SSH 개인 키 암호 문구 필드에 배스천 키 암호 문구를 입력합니다. 절차: PAYG 연결 종료 명령으로 설정 프로세스를 완료하십시오. 절차: PAYG 연결 종료 새로운 PAYG 연결 데이터 추가를 완료하려면 만들기를 클릭하십시오. PAYG 연결 데이터 세부 정보 페이지로 돌아갑니다. 업데이트된 연결 상태는 정보 상단 섹션에 표시됩니다. 연결 상태는 관리자 > 설정 마법사 > Pay-as-you-go 화면에도 표시됩니다. 인스턴스에 대한 인증 데이터가 올바르면, 상태 열에 \"자격 증명이 업데이트됨\" 메시지가 표시됩니다. 언제든 잘못된 데이터를 입력하면 새로 생성된 인스턴스가 관리자 > 설정 마법사 > PAYG에 표시되고 상태 열에 오류 메시지가 표시됩니다. 서버에서 인증 데이터를 사용할 수 있게 되면 사용 가능한 제품 목록이 업데이트됩니다. 사용 가능한 제품은 PAYG 인스턴스에 설치된 것과 동일한 제품군 및 아키텍처의 모든 버전입니다. 예를 들어, 인스턴스에 SLES 15 SP1 제품이 설치되어 있으면 SLES 15 SP2, SLES 15 SP3, SLES 15 SP4 및 SLES 15 SP5가 관리자 > 설정 마법사 > 제품에 자동으로 표시됩니다. 제품이 사용 가능한 것으로 표시되면 사용자는 제품 이름 옆의 확인란을 선택하고 제품 추가를 클릭하여 Uyuni에 제품을 추가할 수 있습니다. 성공 메시지가 표시되면 소프트웨어 > 채널 목록 > 전체로 이동하여 Web UI에서 새로 추가된 채널을 확인할 수 있습니다. 각 채널의 동기화 진행 상황을 모니터링하려면 Uyuni 서버의 /var/log/rhn/reposync 디렉토리에서 로그 파일을 확인하십시오. If a product is provided by both the PAYG instance and one of the SUSE Customer Center subscriptions, it will appear only once in the products list. When the channels belonging to that product are synced, the data might still come from the SCC subscription, and not from the Pay-As-You-Go instance. 다음 절차는 인스턴스의 SSH 연결 데이터를 삭제하는 방법을 설명합니다. 절차: 인스턴스에 대한 연결 데이터 삭제 관리자 > 설정 마법사 > PAYG를 여십시오. 기존 인스턴스 목록에서 인스턴스를 검색하십시오. 인스턴스 세부 정보를 클릭하십시오. 삭제 버튼을 선택하고 선택 항목을 확인하십시오. 인스턴스 목록으로 되돌아갑니다. 방금 삭제한 항목은 더 이상 표시되지 않습니다. Uyuni 서버는 인스턴스에서 수집한 자격 증명을 사용하여 RMT 서버에 연결하고 reposync를 사용하여 패키지를 다운로드합니다. 이러한 자격 증명은 정의된 SSH 연결 데이터를 사용하여 taskomatic에 의해 10분마다 새로 고쳐집니다. RMT 서버에 대한 연결은 PAYG 인스턴스에서 수집된 마지막으로 알려진 인증 자격 증명을 항상 사용합니다. PAYG 인스턴스 자격 증명 수집 상태는 Status 열 또는 인스턴스 세부사항 페이지에 표시됩니다. 인스턴스에 연결할 수 없는 경우 자격 증명 업데이트 프로세스가 실패하고 새로 고침이 두 번 실패하면 자격 증명이 무효화됩니다. 자격 증명이 유효하지 않은 경우 채널 동기화가 실패합니다. 이를 방지하려면 연결된 인스턴스를 계속 실행합니다. SSH 연결 데이터가 명시적으로 삭제된 경우를 제외하고, PAYG 인스턴스는 Uyuni 서버에 연결된 상태를 유지합니다. 인스턴스에 대한 SSH 연결 데이터를 삭제하려면 절차: 인스턴스에 대한 연결 데이터 삭제 명령을 사용하십시오. 항상 Uyuni 서버에서 PAYG 인스턴스에 액세스할 수 있는 것은 아닙니다. 인스턴스가 존재하지만 중지된 경우에는 마지막으로 알려진 자격 증명을 사용하여 인스턴스에 연결을 시도합니다. 자격 증명 유효 기간은 클라우드 공급자에 따라 다릅니다. If the instance no longer exists, but is still registered with MLM, its credentials are no longer valid and the authentication will fail. 오류 메시지는 상태 열에 표시됩니다. 오류 메시지는 인스턴스를 사용할 수 없다는 것만을 나타냅니다. 인스턴스 상태에 대한 자세한 진단은 클라우드 공급자에서 수행해야 합니다. PAYG 인스턴스에서 다음 작업 또는 변경 사항이 발생하면 자격 증명이 작동하지 않게 됩니다. * zypper 자격 증명 파일 제거 * 가져온 인증서 제거 * /etc/hosts에서 클라우드 관련 항목 제거 자격 증명을 수집하는 PAYG 인스턴스를 Salt 클라이언트로 등록할 수 있습니다. 인스턴스에는 유효한 클라우드 연결이 등록되어 있어야 하며, 그렇지 않으면 채널에 액세스할 수 없습니다. 사용자가 클라우드 패키지를 제거하면 자격 증명 수집이 작동하지 않을 수 있습니다. 우선 PAYG 인스턴스를 설정하여 인증 데이터를 수집합니다. 그러면 채널을 동기화할 수 있습니다. 나머지 프로세스는 비퍼블릭 클라우드 클라이언트에서와 동일하며 채널 동기화, 자동 부트스트랩 스크립트 생성, 활성화 키 생성 및 등록 시작으로 구성됩니다. 클라이언트 등록에 대한 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 자격 증명 확인 스크립트가 자격 증명 수집에 실패하면 로그 및 Web UI에 적절한 오류 메시지가 표시되어야 합니다. 자격 증명이 작동하지 않으면 reposync에 적절한 오류가 표시되어야 합니다. registercloudguest 설치 공용 클라우드 업데이트 인프라에 대한 registercloudguest 연결을 새로 고치거나 변경해도 자격 증명을 사용하는 데 방해가 되지 않아야 합니다. 클라우드 게스트 명령에 새 클라우드 연결이 등록되어 있지 않은 경우 registercloudguest --clean을 실행하면 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다.","title":"PAYG 인스턴스 연결","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"connect-payg","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/connect-payg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This could be a Squid server or similar. To allow the Uyuni Server internet access in such configuration, you need to configure the following: Operating System Internet access Modify /etc/sysconfig/proxy according to your needs. PROXY_ENABLED=\"no\" HTTP_PROXY=\"\" HTTPS_PROXY=\"\" NO_PROXY=\"localhost, 127.0.0.1\" podman container Internet access. Modify /etc/systemd/system/uyuni-server.service.d/custom.conf according to your needs.

On the container host, execute mgrctl term to open a command line inside the server container: Modify /etc/rhn/rhn.conf according to your needs. For example, set: # Use proxy FQDN, or FQDN:port server.satellite.http_proxy = server.satellite.http_proxy_username = server.satellite.http_proxy_password = # no_proxy is a comma seperated list server.satellite.no_proxy = At the end, on the container host, restart the server to enforce the new configuration: + systemctl restart uyuni-server.service If you are on an internal network and do not have access to SUSE Customer Center, you can use an Air-gapped Deployment. In a production environment, the Uyuni Server and clients should always use a firewall. For a comprehensive list of the required ports, see 필수 네트워크 포트. 이 섹션에서는 Uyuni에서의 다양한 통신을 위해 사용되는 전체 포트 목록이 제공됩니다. 이러한 모든 포트를 열 필요는 없습니다. 사용 중인 서비스에 필요한 포트만 열면 됩니다. 무단 액세스로부터 서버를 보호하려면 Uyuni 서버에서 외부 인바운드 포트를 열어 방화벽을 구성해야 합니다. 이러한 포트를 열면 외부 네트워크 트래픽이 Uyuni 서버에 액세스할 수 있습니다.

Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure에서 이러한 지침을 테스트했지만 약간의 차이는 있지만 다른 공급자에서도 작동해야 합니다. 시작하기 전 고려해야 할 사항은 다음과 같습니다. Uyuni 설정 절차는 정방향 확인 된 역방향 DNS 조회를 수행합니다. 설정 절차를 완료하고 Uyuni이 예상대로 작동하려면 이 작업이 성공해야 합니다. Uyuni를 설정하기 전에 호스트 이름 및 IP 구성을 수행하는 것이 중요합니다. Uyuni 서버 및 프록시 인스턴스는 DNS 항목을 관리할 수 있는 네트워크 구성에서 실행해야 하지만 인터넷에서 전체적으로 액세스할 수 없습니다. 이 네트워크 구성에서는 DNS 확인이 제공되어야 합니다. hostname -f에서 FQDN(정규화된 도메인 이름)을 반환해야 합니다. DNS 확인은 클라이언트 연결에도 중요합니다. DNS는 선택한 클라우드 프레임워크와 독립적입니다. 자세한 지침은 클라우드 공급자의 설명서를 참조하십시오. 외부 가상 디스크에서 소프트웨어 리포지토리, 서버 데이터베이스 및 프록시 squid 캐시를 찾는 것이 좋습니다. 이를 수행하면 인스턴스가 예기치 않게 종료되는 경우 데이터 손실을 방지할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션에는 외부 가상 디스크를 설정하기 위한 지침이 포함되어 있습니다. 공용 클라우드에서 Uyuni를 사용하는 경우 제한 네트워크를 사용해야 합니다. 방화벽이 올바르게 설정된 VPC 개인 서브넷을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 지정된 IP 범위의 시스템만 인스턴스에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 퍼블릭 클라우드에서 Uyuni을 실행하면 강력한 보안 조치를 구현할 수 있습니다. 인스턴스에 대한 액세스 제한, 필터링, 모니터링 및 감사 기능은 필수 기능입니다. SUSE는 적절한 경계 보안이 부족한 전역 액세스 Uyuni 인스턴스를 사용하지 않을 것을 강력하게 권장됩니다. Uyuni Web UI에 액세스하려면, 네트워크 액세스 제어를 구성할 때 HTTPS를 허용하십시오. 이렇게 하면 Uyuni Web UI에 액세스할 수 있습니다. EC2 및 Azure에서 새 보안 그룹을 만들고 HTTPS에 대한 인바운드 및 아웃바운드 규칙을 추가합니다. GCE에서 방화벽 섹션 아래의 HTTPS 트래픽 허용 상자를 선택합니다. Uyuni용 리포지토리와 데이터베이스를 루트 볼륨과 별도의 스토리지 장치에 저장하는 것이 좋습니다. 이렇게 하면 데이터 손실을 방지하고 성능을 향상하는 데 도움이 됩니다. Uyuni 컨테이너는 기본 스토리지 위치를 사용합니다. 이러한 위치는 사용자 정의 스토리지를 배포하기 전에 구성해야 합니다. 자세한 내용은 영구 컨테이너 볼륨에서 확인할 수 있습니다. 공용 클라우드 설치에는 논리적 볼륨 관리(LVM)를 사용하지 않아야 합니다. 리포지토리 저장소를 위한 디스크 크기는 Uyuni로 관리할 배포 및 채널 수에 따라 다릅니다. 가상 디스크를 연결하면 인스턴스에 Unix 장치 노드로 표시됩니다. 장치 노드의 이름은 공급자 및 선택한 인스턴스 유형에 따라 다릅니다. Uyuni 서버의 루트 볼륨이 100GB 이상인지 확인합니다. 500GB 이상의 추가 저장소 디스크를 추가하고 가능하면 SSD 저장소를 선택하십시오. Uyuni 서버의 클라우드 이미지는 인스턴스가 시작될 때 스크립트를 사용하여 별도의 볼륨을 할당합니다. 인스턴스를 시작할 때 Uyuni 서버에 로그인하고 이 명령을 사용하여 사용 가능한 모든 저장소 장치를 찾을 수 있습니다. hwinfo --disk | grep -E \"장치 파일:\" 선택해야 할 장치가 확실하지 않은 경우 lsblk 명령을 사용하여 각 장치의 이름과 크기를 확인하십시오. 찾고 있는 가상 디스크의 크기와 일치하는 이름을 선택하십시오. mgr-storage-server 명령어로 외부 디스크를 설정할 수 있습니다. 그러면 /manager_storage에 마운트된 XFS 파티션이 생성되고 이를 데이터베이스 및 리포지토리의 위치로 사용합니다. /usr/bin/mgr-storage-server <devicename>","title":"공용 클라우드 요구사항","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"pubcloud-requirements","url":"/uyuni/installation-and-upgrade/pubcloud-requirements.html","titles":[{"text":"1. 네트워크 요구사항","hash":"_네트워크_요구사항","id":1},{"text":"2. 스토리지 볼륨 준비","hash":"_스토리지_볼륨_준비","id":2}]},"181":{"id":181,"text":"Uyuni uses a rolling release versioning schema.

These repositories are organized into channels each of which provide software specific to a distribution, release, and architecture. After synchronizing with SCC, clients can receive updates, be organized into groups, and assigned to specific product software channels. This section covers synchronizing with SCC from the Web UI and adding your first client channel. For Uyuni, synchronizing products from SUSE Customer Center is optional. Before you can synchronize software repositories with SCC, you will need to enter organization credentials in Uyuni. The organization credentials give you access to the SUSE product downloads.

Procedure: Troubleshooting Synchronization Problems Log the HTTP output into /var/log/zypper.log: ZYPP_MEDIA_CURL_DEBUG=2 spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label> Export the setting: export URLGRABBER_DEBUG=DEBUG Start the synchronization: /usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync --channel <channel-label> --type yum You can increase the debug level, by adding the [option]``-vvv`` option to the command. When the complete completes, or fails, disable debug mode: unset URLGRABBER_DEBUG You can add custom HTTP headers to the requests made by spacewalk-repo-sync at the time of synchronization. The custom HTTP headers are defined in the /etc/rhn/spacewalk-repo-sync/extra_headers.conf configuration file. The headers can be defined by repository name or channel label. You can also define global headers by putting them in the main section. For example: [testchannel] X-MY-HEADER-1=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-2=VALUE [mychannel] X-MY-HEADER-3=VALUE X-MY-HEADER-4=VALUE [main] X-MYGLOBAL-HEADER=VALUE This can be particularly useful when dealing with Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) repositories in the public cloud.","title":"Synchronization CLI Tools","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"cli-sync","url":"/uyuni/reference/cli-sync.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Preface","hash":"_preface","id":1}]},"193":{"id":193,"text":"To set up the Uyuni for Retail environment, you will need to have already installed and configured: Uyuni for Retail Server one or more Uyuni for Retail containerized proxies one or more Uyuni build host This section covers how to configure your environment using containerized Uyuni Proxy for Saltboot deployment. Containerized workflow not longer implicitly configures DHCP for PXE booting. Without the formula, make sure your DHCP server has correct PXE booting setting pointing to containerized proxy. For more information how to use DHCP formula to configure DHCP server, see DHCPd Formula. Containerized workflow requires POS images build using the newest Uyuni Server. In this example we are going to use branch id B0001. As a terminal we assume to have one terminal with hardware manufacturer TerminalOEM and model T1000. For POS image we assume to have one with name POS_Image_JeOS7. Procedure Create the following three system groups. For guidelines on how to create the groups, see 시스템 그룹. TERMINALS HWType:TerminalOEM-T1000 B0001 The first group is generic optional group for collecting all POS terminals. The second group is hardware type group for our POS terminal. The third group is mandatory branch group. For more information about Saltboot groups, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Assign Saltboot Group formula to group B0001 we just created. This converts the branch group to Saltboot Group. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured in Saltboot Group. Saltboot groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name and Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula used in regular Uyuni for Retail setups. Name of the Saltboot Group is automatically used as a branch id, an identifier for group of machines booted through particular containerized Uyuni Proxy. All Saltboot deployed machines though containerized proxy will automatically became members of its Saltboot group. To connect Saltboot group with containerized proxy, fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. With this, mandatory configuration is finished. The rest of configuration is optional. Configure Default boot image for new registrations to specify what boot image should be booted by not yet registered POS terminal. This is useful when stable boot image is wanted for initial deployments. Without this setting, newest built boot image is used as default boot image. If Default boot image for new registrations is set, option to set its version appears under name Default boot image version where specific image version can be set. Option Kernel parameters for the group can be used to pass extra kernel options to all POS terminals registered withing this Saltboot group. Last three options are related to how will be newly registered machine visible in Uyuni Server. For explanation of possible configurations, see Terminal Names. External DHCP service must be used with containerized Saltboot. For more information about how to enable PXE booting in DHCP service, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. Containerized workflow relies on updated image building in Uyuni Server, where PXE images are no longer collected as bundle, but kernel, initrd and filesystem image are collected individually. Containerized workflow uses new TFTP container which instead of providing files present on the proxy, routes TFTP requests as HTTP requests through local proxy to Uyuni Server. Containerized proxy is not a Salt client, it is not possible to call image-sync state. Once POS image is built and made available on Uyuni Server, it is immediately available to the Saltboot clients as well. Image synchronization is not needed, nor available. This may have implications on how images are deployed to production. The following sections differentiate between containerized and regular workflow. Both are assuming proxy (containerized or in form of Uyuni for Retail Branch Server) are available. Procedure: Deploying with containerized workflow Build POS image Configure DHCP server for PXE booting for given network Create Saltboot group and configure it for existing containerized proxy Boot system to be deployed Procedure: Deploying with non-ontainerized workflow Build POS image Configure and apply Retail formulas on Uyuni for Retail Branch server Apply highstate state on the Branch server Create branch group with the name of Branch ID as set in retail formulas Apply image-sync state on configured Uyuni for Retail Branch server Boot system to be deployed Containerized Saltboot utilizes Cobbler system underneath for managing PXE and UEFI configuration. When new PXE image is built (such as Uyuni for Retail POS_Image_JeOS images) cobbler distro and cobbler profile are automatically generated for this image. For example, when first image POS_Image_JeOS version 7.0.0 is build under organization with number 1 cobbler list will show: # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 These entries contain information about kernel and initrd. These entries are however not yet available for PXE booting. Only when Saltboot group is created, new Cobbler profile is created for this Saltboot group which points to cobbler distro based on default boot image configuration. For example, when system group B0001 is created and Saltboot group formula is assigned and configured for this group, new Cobbler profile is created. # cobbler list distros: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 profiles: 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 1-B0001 When inspecting this new group using command cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 details of this profile reveal configuration of this Saltboot group. # cobbler profile report --name 1-B0001 Name : 1-B0001 Comment : Saltboot group B0001 of organization SUSE default profile Distribution : 1-POS_Image_JeOS7-7.0.0-1 Kernel Options : {'MASTER': ['downloadserver.example.org'], 'MINION_ID_PREFIX': ['B0001']} Kernel options in example are always present and are internal for Saltboot functionality. With this information Cobbler is able to generate required PXE and UEFI Grub configurations which can be checked in /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default and /srv/tftpboot/grub/x86_64_menu_items.cfg. These files contain the end result which will be used by PXE client when determining what to boot and with which parameters.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"containerized-saltboot","url":"/uyuni/retail/containerized-saltboot.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The hardware type group (i.e. HWTYPE group) is used for booting new terminals, while already deployed terminals can be moved to any group that provides the Saltboot formula. This flexibility allows for testing of new images or configurations. Procedure: Dual group image deployment Build new image. Use image synchronization formula to synchronize the image to all Branch Servers. Create a test group. Name the group, for example, TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. The name can be chosen freely. Add the Saltboot formula to this group. Use the same configuration as in the original hardware type group (HWTYPE), except for the image version. Use the name and version of the new image. Move selected terminals. Identify the terminals you want to test the new image on. Transfer these terminals from the group HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to the newly created group TEST:POSVendor-Terminal. It is recommended to use System Set Manager for this task. Reboot terminals. Power on the selected POS terminals. They should boot the new image. Verify and evaluate. Monitor the terminals in the TEST:POSVendor-Terminal group. Check if the new image performs as expected and if there are any issues or errors encountered. Update HWTYPE group. Once you have confirmed that the new image works correctly, the HWTYPE group can be updated. Modify the image version in the HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal group to match the tested and approved version. This ensures that all other terminals receive the new image. By default, Saltboot formula selects the specified image name and version or selects the highest one if the version is not specified. There are multiple methods to control the image version within the HWTYPE and TEST groups: Specify exact version. In both the HWTYPE and TEST groups, specify explicitly the exact version of the image to be deployed. Make sure that the specified image version is already synchronized. Mark new image as Inactive. In the HWTYPE group, do not specify the image version. Mark the new image as Inactive after building and before synchronizing it to Branch Server. The Inactive flag ensures, that the image is not auto-selected when the image version is not specified. After testing, remove the Inactive flag so the image can be auto-selected in the HWTYPE group. The Inactive flag can be accessed through the API. For more information, see Image Pillars. Utilize Freeze Image flag. In the HWTYPE group, omit the image version. Before synchronizing the new image, set the Freeze Image flag in Saltboot formula in HWTYPE group. This ensures that the already deployed terminals in this group will keep the old image. Synchronize and test the new image in the TEST group. Reset the Freeze Image flag in HWTYPE group, so the terminals in this group will be updated to the new image too. Do not use the whitelist in Image Synchronization formula to control which terminal boots which image. It does not provide the required granularity and does not work with containerized Branch Server.","title":"Best practices","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-best-practices","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-best-practices.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Controlling image versions","hash":"_controlling_image_versions","id":2}]},"199":{"id":199,"text":"Uyuni for Retail is made up of various components. For more on how these components work together, see Network Architecture. The Uyuni server contains information about infrastructure, network topology, and everything required to automate image deployment and perform day-to-day operations on branches and terminals. This can include database entries of registered systems, Salt pillar data for images, image assignments, partitioning, network setup, network services, and more. Build hosts can be arbitrary servers or virtual machines. They are used to securely build operating system images. For more information on build hosts, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Branch servers should be physically located close to point-of-service terminals, such as in an individual store or branch office. Branch servers provide services for PXE boot, and act as an image cache, Salt broker, and proxy for software components (RPM packages). The branch server can also manage local networking, and provide DHCP and DNS services. For monitoring, you can install Prometheus server on the Branch servers. For visualization and analysis, you can install Grafana with multiple data sources on a dedicated host. For more information about Prometheus and Grafana, see Prometheus 및 Grafana를 사용한 모니터링. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly. Uyuni for Retail supports POS terminals that boot using both BIOS and UEFI. For UEFI booting terminals, you will need to configure the EFI partition in the Saltboot formula. For more information on EFI in the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Uyuni for Retail uses the same technology as Uyuni, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Because every environment is different, and can contain many different configurations of many different terminals, Uyuni for Retail uses hardware types to simplify device management. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Uyuni for Retail uses system groups to organize the various devices in your environment. Each branch requires a system group, containing a single branch server, and the POS terminals associated with that server. Each system group is identified with a Branch ID. The Branch ID is used in formulas and scripts to automatically update the entire group. Uyuni for Retail uses Salt formulas to help simplify configuration. Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your installation. You can use formulas to apply configuration patterns to your hardware groups. Uyuni for Retail uses the Saltboot formula, which defines partitioning and OS images for terminals. You can use default settings for formulas, or edit them to make them more specific to your environment. For more information about formulas, see Introduction to Retail Formulas. Saltboot is a collection of tools and processes that are used to bootstrap, deploy and validate Uyuni for Retail terminals. Saltboot consists of: Initialization: The Saltboot initrd is created during image building and is required for bootstrapping terminals. Saltboot state: The Salt state that contains the logic for the entire Saltboot process. Partitioning pillars: The Salt pillar structure that describes how terminals are partitioned and what image is deployed on each terminal. Images and boot images pillars: When the image building feature in Uyuni successfully builds an image that contains the Saltboot initrd, the image and boot image Salt pillars are created.

A delta image contains only the differences between two regular images. If there are only a few changes between two images, the delta image can be very small. Synchronizing a delta image to the branch consumes less network bandwidth but it requires some extra hardware resources on the branch server to rebuild the installable image. The retail_create_delta tool creates a delta image on the Uyuni server. The tool uses xdelta3 internally. Use the name and the version strings of the target and the source image as parameters to the command. The format of the parameters must be <NAME>-<VERSION> and they must correspond to the image names and versions available in the pillar. For example, if the pillar contains: images: POS_Image_JeOS6: 6.0.0: ... 6.0.1: ... POS_Image_Graphical6: 6.0.0: ... Then the retail_create_delta command is: retail_create_delta POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.1 POS_Image_JeOS6-6.0.0 This command will generate the delta image between version 6.0.0 and version 6.0.1. The resulting delta file is saved in /srv/www/os-images and the corresponding pillar in the database. Performance tuning is possible with the -B <VALUE> option, which is passed to xdelta3. With higher values you achieve smaller deltas at the cost of higher memory requirements. For more information, see the xdelta3 documentation (man xdelta3). When an image is synchronized to the branch server, the image-sync-formula first checks whether the source image is available on the branch server. Only if the source image is available, the delta will be downloaded to save network bandwidth.","title":"Delta Images","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-delta-images","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-delta-images.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This is achieved using Salt grains. Automatically accepting keys is less secure than manually checking and accepting keys. Only use this method on trusted networks. There are three different ways you can configure auto-signed grains: Configure Saltboot to send automatically signed grains once and then delete them. To do this, append the Saltboot configuration to an existing initrd. For more information, see [retail.deployterminals.auto.once]. Choose to keep the automatically signed grains on the Salt client. To do this, include the configuration file in the image source before the client image is built. After booting, the auto-signed grain is stored on the client as a regular Salt grain. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains. Configure Saltboot during PXE boot using kernel parameters. For more information, see Configure Saltboot to Auto-Sign During PXE Boot. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the Uyuni Server to accept them. For more information, see Configure the Server to Auto-Accept. When you have configured Saltboot using one of these methods, you need to configure the server to accept them. The server stores the autosign keys in a file within the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory, which is preserved in etc-salt volume. You can enable auto-signing by creating an auto-sign file that contains the key you created when you configured Saltboot. Procedure: Configuring the Server to Auto-Accept At the command prompt of the Uyuni container host, as root, enter the server container: mgrctl term Inside the container, execute the following steps: In directory /etc/salt/master.d/, create file autosign_grains.conf and specify autosign_grains_dir: echo \"autosign_grains_dir: /etc/salt/autosign_grains\" \\ > /etc/salt/master.d/autosign_grains.conf Create a file at /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key, that contains the auto-sign key you specified with Saltboot (replace <AUTOSIGN_KEY> with the key: mkdir /etc/salt/autosign_grains echo \"<AUTOSIGN_KEY>\" > /etc/salt/autosign_grains/autosign_key For multiple keys, put each one on a new line. For more information about configuring the server to automatically accept grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/autoaccept_grains.html. Use different procedure for SLE 15 and SLE 12. Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 15) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY> # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Procedure: Configuring Saltboot to Keep Auto-Signed Grains (SLE 12) In the location where the image source is built, such as a build host or source repository, create a configuration file called etc/salt/minion.d/autosign-grains.conf. This must be outside of the root directory provided by the template. This way you prevent the inclusion of unwanted files in the initrd. Edit the new configuration file with these details. You can use any value you like as the auto-sign key: # create the grain grains: autosign_key: <AUTOSIGN_KEY> # send the grain as part of auth request autosign_grains: - autosign_key Create a tarball of this directory: tar -czf autosign-grains.tgz etc Edit the config.xml template file. In the <packages type=\"image\"> element, add: <archive name=\"autosign.tgz\" bootinclude=\"true\"/> Save the file and rebuild the image.

You can also bootstrap terminals across a wireless network. Hardware type groups must be created and images must be synchronized before continuing. For more information, see Deployment basics. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server, and not directly to the Uyuni Server by mistake. If you do not want to boot terminals from the network, you can create a live USB image and deploy terminals using a removable USB storage device. This is useful if you cannot boot your terminals from the network, or if you do not have a local Uyuni for Retail branch server providing network services. You can prepare a bootable USB device with the image and tools required to deploy a POS terminal using a remote Uyuni for Retail branch server. You can create the bootable USB device on the branch server directly, or on the Uyuni for Retail Server. POS devices booted using the USB device are assigned to the Uyuni for Retail branch server that created the USB device. Procedure: Creating a Bootable USB Device On the Uyuni for Retail branch server, at the command prompt, as root, create the POS image. You need to specify the size of the image, in megabytes. Ensure you allow at least 300 MB: salt-call image_sync_usb.create <usb image name> <size in MB> Insert the USB device into the Uyuni for Retail branch server machine, and copy the image to the new location: dd bs=1M if=<usb image name> of=<path to usb device> When you have the image on the USB drive, check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals using USB Insert the USB device into the terminal. Power on the POS terminal. Boot from the USB device to begin bootstrapping. For terminals that cannot be connected directly to the physical network, you can deploy them over a wireless network. Wireless networks do not support PXE booting, so you must perform the initial booting and initialization of the wireless connection on the terminal using a USB device. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Bootstrapping across a wireless network could expose a security risk if you are using encrypted OS images. The boot initrd image and the partition that contains /etc/salt must be stored unencrypted on the terminal. This allows Uyuni for Retail to set up the wireless network. If this breaches your security requirements, you will need to use a separate production network, with network credentials managed by Salt, so that credentials are not stored on the terminal unencrypted. Before you begin, you need to have created a bootable USB device. Ensure that the OS image you use to create the USB device has the dracut-wireless package included. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. When you have created the USB device, you need to provide the wireless credentials to the terminal. You can do this in a number of ways: Directly during image build. Add it to the initrd file on the branch server. During terminal booting, using the kernel command line. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Image Build Ensure that the dracut-wireless package is included in the image template. Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file to the image template, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> If you want to use different credentials for bootstrapping to what is used during normal operation, you can remove the ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD line. 이미지를 빌드합니다. Prepare a USB device using this image, and boot the terminal. For more information about using USB devices to boot, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials with initrd Set the wireless credentials by creating or editing the etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file, with these details: # ALLOW_UPDATE_FROM_INITRD WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless network name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless network password> . Copy the file to initrd on the branch server: echo ./etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 | cpio -H newc -o | gzip >> /srv/saltboot/boot/initrd.gz Check that the terminals you want to deploy allow local booting. You can check this by editing the Saltboot formula in the Uyuni for Retail Web UI. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Procedure: Providing Wireless Credentials During Terminal Boot Mount the USB device on the terminal, and boot from it. Append these commands to the kernel boot parameters: WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> After you have set the wireless credentials, you can change them as needed. The way to do this is different if you use one company-wide network, or if you have each branch server on its own separate network. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Single Network Rebuild the boot image with updated credentials. Recreate the bootable USB device based on the new boot image. Boot terminal from new USB device. Procedure: Changing Wireless Credentials for Multiple Networks In the /srv/salt/ directory, create a salt state called update-terminal-credentials.sls, and enter the new wireless network credentials: /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> # regenerate initrd cmd.run: - name: 'mkinitrd' Apply the Salt state to the terminal: salt <terminal_salt_name> state.apply update-terminal-credentials If you are using a separate network for the boot phase, the managed file might need to be renamed, or extended to /etc/sysconfig/network/initrd-ifcfg-wlan0. You can configure terminals to use a different set of wireless credentials during the boot process, to what they use during normal operation. If you provide wireless credentials using initrd files, you can create two different files, one for use during boot called initrd-ifcfg-wlan0, and the other for use during normal operation, called ifcfg-wlan0. Alternatively, you can use custom Salt states to manage wireless credentials with saltboot-hook. First of all, you need to set the wireless details for normal operation. This will become the default settings. Then you can specify a second Salt state with the wireless details for use during the boot procedure. Procedure: Using Different Wireless Credentials for Production Network Write a custom Salt state named /srv/salt/saltboot_hook.sls containing the wireless details for normal operation. This Salt state is applied by Saltboot after the system image is deployed. {% set root = salt['environ.get']('NEWROOT') %} {{ root }}/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0: file.managed: - contents: | WIRELESS_ESSID=<wireless_network_name> WIRELESS_WPA_PSK=<wireless_network_password> - require: - saltboot: saltboot_fstab - require_in: - saltboot: boot_system The boot phase supports only WPA2 PSK wireless configuration. Salt-managed production configuration supports all features supported by all major operating systems.","title":"Deploy Terminals - Other Methods","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-deploy-terminals-other","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-deploy-terminals-other.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

For other methods of booting terminals, including using a USB device, or booting over a wireless network, see Deploy Terminals - Other Methods. Terminals can be either x86-64 or arm64 architecture. If you have many terminals, you can handle them with a script. For more information, see Mass Configuration. Before terminals can be deployed, ensure you have prepared a Saltboot-based operating system image. For more information about building OS images, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. After you have registered new terminals, always check the Uyuni Web UI to ensure your terminals have connected successfully to the branch server. The terminals must not have directly connected to the Uyuni Server by mistake. Each terminal requires a specific hardware type, which contains information about the product name and terminal manufacturer. However, at the beginning, the Uyuni database does not have this information. To tell Uyuni what image to deploy on each terminal, you can set hardware type groups. After you have created a new hardware type group, you can apply the Saltboot formula to the group and configure it for your environment. Hardware types allow you to group devices according to manufacturer and device name. Then, all devices of a particular type can be managed as one. Empty profiles can be assigned to a hardware type group either before or after registration. If an empty profile is not assigned to a hardware type group before registration, it will be assigned to group that best matches the product information available to it. For this procedure, you will require the system manufacturer name and product name for your terminal. Procedure: Creating a Hardware Type Group Determine the hardware type group name. Prefix the name with HWTYPE:, followed by the system manufacturer name and product name, separated by a hyphen. For example: HWTYPE:POSVendor-Terminal1 In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems System Groups, and click the Create Group button. In the Create System Group dialog, create a new system group, using the hardware type group name you determined in step one of this procedure. Only use colons, hyphens, or underscores in hardware type group names. Spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters will be removed when the name is processed. Each hardware type group must have the Saltboot formula applied. Procedure: Assigning the Saltboot Formula Open the details page for your new hardware type group, and navigate to the Formulas tab. Select the Saltboot formula and click Save. Navigate to the Formulas Saltboot tab. Configure the Saltboot formula. For more information about the Saltboot formula, see Saltboot Formula. Manual synchronization of images is needed only when using non-containerized Uyuni for Retail 4.3 branch server. Image synchronization downloads system and boot images from the Uyuni Server to the Uyuni for Retail branch server. This may involve updating default boot image for not yet registered terminals. Default boot image can be set in the Image Synchronize formula. If default boot image is not set, boot image with highest version is used as default boot image. This behaviour can be disabled by unchecking Use Latest Boot Image checkbox in the Image Synchronize formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_salt_id> state.apply image-sync When you have your bootstrap image ready, you can deploy the image to the terminals. Procedure: Deploying Images to the Terminals Power on your POS terminals. The branch server will bootstrap the terminals according to the data you have provided. You can change the terminal boot process using Salt pillars. Two Salt pillars allow you to change the protocol and server used to download the image. The saltboot_download_protocol pillar specifies which protocol should be used to download the image to the terminal. This overrides the default protocol specified in the image pillar. Allowed values are http, https, ftp, or tftp. The saltboot_download_server pillar specifies which server to use to download the image. This overrides the default hostname specified in the image pillar. In this example, the download server must be prepared by the image_sync state before you begin. Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Protocol This example changes the protocol used for all terminals. Create the top.sls file with content: base: '*': - saltboot_proto Create the saltboot_proto.sls file with content: saltboot_download_protocol: http # can be http, https, ftp, tftp Move these files to the container: mgrctl cp top.sls server:/srv/pillar/ mgrctl cp saltboot_proto.sls server:/srv/pillar/ Example: Changing the Saltboot Image Download Location This example changes the download location for all terminals on a specified branch server.

Formulas can be configured using Uyuni Web UI, or the Uyuni XMLRPC API. To fully configure Uyuni for Retail, these formulas need to be enabled and configured on the branch server. The following formulas can be used for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3 with Uyuni 5.0: Branch network formula, see Branch Network Formula PXE formula, see PXE Formula TFTP formula, see TFTPd Formula In addition, Bind and DHCPd formulas can be used, but not on the branch server because SLE Micro does not have Bind and DHCPd in the repositories. Bind formula, see Bind Formula DHCPD formula, see DHCPd Formula Optionally, you can also enable the image synchronization formula. For more information, see Image Synchronization Formula. Badly configured formulas can result in the branch server failing to work as expected. Due to the generic nature of formulas it is difficult to do overall validation. We recommend that you configure the branch server using the Uyuni for Retail command line utilities, and use individual formula settings for further tuning if required. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If a formula uses the same name as an existing Salt state, the two names will collide. This could result in the formula being used instead of the state. Always check the names of states and formulas to avoid name collisions. When you have made changes to your formula, ensure you apply the highstate. The highstate propagates your changes to the appropriate services.

You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server, you will need to have images prepared for synchronization. If you are configuring more than one branch server, you can use the same images across different branch servers. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. You will need to synchronize the images, and can skip setting up the services on the branch server. Usually, POS images are rebuild when updated packages are available, and synchronized to the branch servers before the update window opens. For information about Uyuni image building, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. By default, POS templates do not include a system user. You will not be able to login as a user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user. You can use Salt to install a system user after the terminal has been deployed. Before you configure the branch server, ensure you have decided on networking topology and you choose branch id. For information about the possible network topologies, see Network Architecture. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 시스템 그룹에 대한 자세한 내용은 시스템 그룹에서 확인할 수 있습니다. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. Uyuni for Retail command line tools create required system groups and branch group automatically. In case you plan to use the branch server as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources.

Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states. This section covers general information about generic Saltboot requirements. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Saltboot is usually used in network boot environment. For this to work DHCP service for the network terminal is connected to must have PXE or sometimes called BOOTP support enabled. Example 1. Example of ISC DHCP server configuration with PXE booting enabled if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 10) = \"HTTPClient\" { option vendor-class-identifier \"HTTPClient\"; filename \"<FQDN of branch server proxy>/saltboot/shim.efi\"; } else { if option arch = 00:07 { filename \"boot/shim.efi\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } else { filename \"boot/pxelinux.0\"; next-server <IP address of branch server proxy>; } } Notice two important options, next-server which is set to the branch server IP address and filename set to the boot/pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and boot/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot support. Containerized branch proxy uses different filename then regular branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires some information where the Salt master is and from where to download the image. Saltboot tries multiple discoveries to obtain this information, described below. For successful terminal deployment, both service discoveries must be successful. Depending on your architecture, choose what strategy works for you best. During Saltboot initrd start, integrated Salt client needs to find branch server proxy to connect to. This discovery is trying following steps: MASTER kernel command line option is set, then this is used as Salt master resolve salt CNAME, if successful then resolved value is used as Salt master use salt as a Salt master Once Salt master is determined, Salt client configuration is generated and started. Using fully qualified domain name in MASTER or salt CNAME is important. If used fully qualified domain name is different from fully qualified domain name of branch server proxy known to Uyuni, Saltboot may work correctly, however proxy detection of terminal will not work. Before POS image is downloaded to the terminal, download server discovery is done to find where to download image from: saltboot_download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used saltboot:download_server pillar is set for terminal, then its value is used resolve ftp hostname Value obtained by download server discovery is then used together with POS image pillar to fetch correct image from correct location. Last piece for Saltboot is to provide partitioning for terminal. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. The OS image you use on the Uyuni server must be synchronized for use to the branch server. You can do this with the Salt image-sync state, part of the Image Synchronization Formula. Procedure: Synchronizing Images to the Branch Server On the Uyuni server, run this command: salt <branch_server_minion_id> state.apply image-sync The image details will be transferred to /srv/saltboot on the branch server. You can also set synchronization to run automatically on the branch server. Configure the image synchronization formula to apply the highstate regularly. For more information about Image Synchronization Formula, see Image Synchronization Formula.","title":"Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment with non-containerized 4.3 branch server","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-install-setup-43","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-install-setup-43.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

You will need to revisit some of these steps later on as you are working with Uyuni for Retail. For example, the first time you configure the branch server group, you will need to have images prepared already. If you are configuring more than one branch server, the same images are reused across different branch server groups. If you have an existing environment, and need to build new images, you do not need to re-initialize the branches. For information about Uyuni image building, see 이미지 빌드 및 관리. Uyuni for Retail POS images are images specifically tailored for Uyuni for Retail environment and designed to be deployed using PXE booting mechanism. As starting point, SUSE provides basic templates at https://github.com/SUSE/manager-build-profiles/tree/master/OSImage. These templates need to be adapted for specific usecases, for example by including specific applications, configuration settings, and users. POS image templates and resulting images do not set a system user password. You will not be able to login as a system user to a system that has been installed with a SUSE provided template without customization. However you can use Salt to manage clients without a system user password. You can use Salt to set up a system user password after the terminal has been deployed. After POS image is successfully built and inspected by Uyuni, you can validate that POS boot image was correctly registered by following procedure. Procedure Validate POS boot image On Uyuni command line execute following command: mgrctl exec cobbler distro list Your POS image should be listed with organization number before image name For every branch server choose branch id. As a branch id select any alphanumerical string with up to 64 characters. Uyuni for Retail requires: branch system group for every branch server proxy, using branch id as its name hardware type system group for every used hardware type, using HWTYPE: prefix in its name For more information about hardware type groups, see Deployment basics. Missing mandatory system group will cause terminal bootstrap to fail. Uyuni for Retail also recognizes two optional groups for better overview: TERMINALS SERVERS You can create system groups using the Uyuni Web UI. Navigate to Systems System Groups and click Create System Group. 시스템 그룹에 대한 자세한 내용은 시스템 그룹에서 확인할 수 있습니다. During terminal bootstrap terminal automatically joins: branch system group based on received branch_id. This will make branch group formulas available to the terminal. HWType group based on SMBios information received from terminal. This will make Saltboot partitioning pillar available to the terminal. TERMINALS if this group exists. In case you plan to use the branch server container host as a monitoring server with Prometheus, be aware that Prometheus demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Prometheus, see Prometheus 및 Grafana를 사용한 모니터링. In case you plan to use the branch server container host with Ansible software, be aware that Ansible demands additional hardware resources. For more information about installing Ansible, see Ansible 통합. Before configuring Saltboot group, make sure you already have at least one POS image available. Containerized Uyuni for Retail is configured using so called Saltboot Group. Saltboot groups are branch groups, system group with branch id as its name created in previous step, with Saltboot Group formula enabled. Saltboot Group formula is a successor of Branch Network formula, PXE formula and TFTP formula previously used in Uyuni for Retail setups. To connect Saltboot Group with containerized proxy fill Image Download Server entry with Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the containerized proxy. Saltboot technology is used to deploy POS images to the terminals. Saltboot consists of saltboot enabled initrd (build as part of POS images) and saltboot Salt states.

Uyuni for Retail branch proxy uses different filename then previous non-containerized branch server. For containerized branch proxy set filename to the pxelinux.0 for BIOS based system and grub/shim.efi for UEFI systems with SecureBoot. Saltboot requires instructions how to partitioning terminal harddisk and what image to deploy. This is done individually for each hardware type of terminals. For more information about hardware types and partitioning, see Deployment basics. Above mentioned steps are mandatory minimum for successful Saltboot deployment. For configuration examples, see Example configurations. Uyuni for Retail 2025.05 no longer need manual image synchronization, all images are available to all clients automatically.

Mass configuration tool was not yet adapted for containerized saltboot workflow. Branch servers are configured individually using formulas. If you are working in an environment with many branch servers, it often helps to configure branch servers automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. Before working with the mass configuration tool, back up the existing branch servers configuration. The mass configuration tool overwrites the existing configuration with data specified in the provided YAML file. The mass configuration tool does not support all possible formula configurations. Always make sure on a small sample that the mass configuration tool can configure systems as expected. Configuring multiple branch servers requires the python-susemanager-retail package, which is provided with Uyuni for Retail. Install the python-susemanager-retail package on the Uyuni server. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Branch Servers Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni for Retail installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed correctly. Also check that the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, register them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. Use empty profiles together with activation keys to onboard all the systems of your infrastructure. Use an activation key to assign the channels listed in Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment. If you are working in an environment with many terminals, it often helps to configure terminals automatically with a pre-defined configuration file, rather than configuring each one individually. You will need to have your infrastructure planned out ahead of time, including the IP addresses, hostnames, and domain names of branch servers and terminals. You will also require the hardware (MAC) addresses of each terminal. The settings specified in the configuration file cannot always be successfully applied. In cases where there is a conflict, Uyuni will ignore the request in the file. This is especially important when designating hostnames. You should always check that the details have been applied as expected after using this configuration method. Procedure: Configuring Multiple Terminals Create a YAML file describing the infrastructure you intend to install, specifying the hardware address for each terminal. For an example YAML file, see Example YAML File for Mass Configuration. On a clean Uyuni installation, import the YAML file you have created: retail_yaml --from-yaml filename.yaml See the retail_yaml --help output for additional options. In the Uyuni Web UI, check that your systems are listed and displaying correctly, and the formulas you require are available. Create activation keys for each of your branch servers, connect them using bootstrap, and configure them as proxy servers. In the States tab, click Apply Highstate to deploy your configuration changes for each branch server. Connect your terminals according to your infrastructure plan. If you need to change your configuration, you can edit the YAML file at any time, and use the retail_yaml --from-yaml command to upload the new configuration. If you already have a configuration that you would like to export to a YAML file, use: retail_yaml --to-yaml filename.yaml This can be a good way to create a basic mass configuration file. However, it is important to check the file before using it, because some mandatory configuration entries may be missing. When you are designing your configuration and creating the YAML file, ensure the branch server ID matches the fully qualified hostname, and the Salt ID. If these do not match, the bootstrap script could fail.","title":"Mass Configuration","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"retail-mass-config","url":"/uyuni/retail/retail-mass-config.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This will occur in these situations: If the Saltboot formula has not started within a specified time (default value is 60 seconds). If the terminal does not acknowledge that the Saltboot formula has started. If the root partition is specified on the kernel command line (handled by the PXE formula), is mountable (and is not encrypted), and contains /etc/ImageVersion (which is created by Kiwi).

SALT_TIMEOUT = 60 For more about kernel parameters, see PXE Formula. If the bandwidth between the branch server and the terminal is low, or for optimization of the terminal update process, POS images can be cached in advance on the terminal. The upgrade can then performed on the terminals when suitable. This functionality requires the terminal to have a dedicated service partition. A service partition is a partition mounted as /srv/saltboot. This partition must be created before the system partition and large enough to store a POS image. To ensure that terminals will always have such a partition, use the Saltboot formula for terminal hardware type to specify the partition details. For more information, see Saltboot Formula.

After terminal finishes booting, Saltboot redeployment setting is automatically reset to prevent repeated redeployment. An API call system.setPillar can be used to set specific Saltboot options through Salt pillar data. Uyuni Saltboot integration is using tuning-saltboot pillar category to manage Saltboot tuning, including forced redeployment or disk repartition. Using this pillar category allows Uyuni to reset Saltboot flag once the terminal is booted up. Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to redeploy image using API call using spacecmd command In the console run following the command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_redeployment\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Forcing Saltboot to repartition disk using API call using spacecmd command In the console run the following command, replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot,{\"saltboot\": {\"force_repartition\": \"True\"}}' system.setPillar Procedure: Check Saltboot tuning options In the console run the following command, and replace $terminal_minion_id with the actual terminal minion id: spacecmd api -- -A '$terminal_minion_id,tuning-saltboot' system.getPillar Make sure to use tuning-saltboot as pillar category in the API call. Pillars specified outside of Uyuni database cannot be reset automatically. Without manual intervention, the terminal will download a new image on each reboot. Procedure: Force a Saltboot to redeploy image using Saltboot pillar Create new file /srv/salt/pillar/force_redeploy.sls with content: saltboot: force_redeploy: True Create new file or update existing file named /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls with content: base: '$terminal_minion_id': - force_redeploy Reboot the terminal to pick up the changes. After the terminal finishes booting, remove modifications made in /srv/salt/pillar/top.sls file. If your terminal encounters a problem with the file system or the partition table, you might need to remove the partition table and reformat the terminal.

Naming schemes available are Hostname, FQDN, HWType, and MAC. Naming scheme and its configuration can be selected in the Saltboot Group formula for containerized branch servers or in the Branch Network formula for others. For more information, see Set Up the Uyuni for Retail Environment using containerized proxy and Branch Network Formula. By default, terminals are named according to the Hostname naming scheme with the HWType scheme as a fallback. Terminal names that are derived from the hardware type use this format: BranchID.Manufacturer-ProductName-SerialNumber-UniqueID 예: B002.TOSHIBA-6140100-41BA03X-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID. The Manufacturer, ProductName, and SerialNumber are provided by the terminal hardware BIOS. If the terminal does not provide a serial number, it will be omitted from the terminal name. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. Added unique ID is a requirement for successful terminal deployment. Without unique ID, subsequent terminal registration will fail. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID. Terminal names that are derived from the hostname use this format: BranchID.Hostname-UniqueID 예: B002.terminal-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The Hostname is the plain hostname (without domain part) of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. Terminal names that are derived from the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) use this format: BranchID.FQDN-UniqueID 예: B002.terminal.example.com-c643 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. Terminal names are derived from the network interface hardware address (MAC) and use this format: BranchID.MAC-UniqueID 예: B0002.52:54:00:62:18:6f-cb83 The BranchID is the unique identifier for the branch server that the terminal is connected to. You can disable this prefix by toggling the Do not prefix Salt client ID with Branch ID checkbox. The MAC is colon delimited hardware address of the network interface card used for booting of the terminal. The UniqueID is the first four characters of a generated machine identification number. You can disable this behavior by toggling the Do not append unique suffix to the Salt client ID checkbox. If you want terminal names to be derived from the hostname, you will need to ensure your terminals have a static hostname. This requires a static IP address to be able to resolve the static hostname. There are a number of different ways to assign hostnames to terminals. This section describes how to do this when DNS and DHCP services are managed by the non-containerized branch server. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with Formulas In the DHCP formula settings, navigate to Hosts with Static IP Address and click Add Item. For more information on the DHCP formula, see DHCPd Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address for the terminal. Ensure the IP address is within the range used by the branch server. In the Hardware Type and Address field, type the hardware type and address in this format: ethernet <terminal_MAC_address> OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. In the Bind formula settings, navigate to the A records of the appropriate non-reverse zone, and click Add Item. For more information on the bind formula, see Bind Formula. In the Hostname field, type the hostname of the branch server. In the IP Address field, type the static IP address you assigned to the terminal in the DHCP formula settings. OPTIONAL: For multiple terminals, click Add Item and fill in the details for each terminal. Click Save Formula to save the changes. Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration. When you re-register the terminal, use the new terminal name. Procedure: Assigning IP Address and Hostname with YAML At the command prompt on the branch server, export a YAML configuration file: retail_yaml --to-yaml retail.yaml Open the YAML file and navigate to the end of the branch server section. Add a new terminals section if it does not already exist. Add the IP address, MAC address, and hardware type for the terminal, using this format: $hostname: IP: <IP_Address> hwAddress: <MAC_Address> hwtype: <HWTYPE_Group_name_without_HWTYPE:_prefix> Import the modified YAML file: retail_yaml --from-yaml retail.yaml Apply the highstate on the branch server to apply the changes. If the terminal was previously registered using a name based on the hardware type instead of the hostname, you will need to delete the previous registration.

For proxy installation procedures, see 컨테이너화된 Uyuni 프록시 설정. Then continue with the following sections. Before you register Uyuni branch servers and terminals to your Uyuni Server, check that you have the openSUSE product enabled, and the required channels are fully synchronized. 이 절차에 필요한 제품은 다음과 같습니다.

You will need to check all the base and child channel log files to be sure that the synchronization is complete. openSUSE 채널은 규모가 매우 클 수 있습니다. 때로 동기화에 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. By default, some operating systems do not trust the GPG key for the Uyuni client tools. The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you will not be able to install new client tool packages or update them until the keys are trusted. 프로시저: 클라이언트의 GPG 키 신뢰 On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, check the contents of the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory. This directory contains all available public keys. Take a note of the key that applies to the client you are registering. Open the relevant bootstrap script, locate the ORG_GPG_KEY= parameter and add the required key. You do not need to delete any previously stored keys. For example: uyuni-gpg-pubkey-0d20833e.key If you are bootstrapping clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you will need to use a Salt state to trust the key. Create the Salt state and assign it to the organization. You can then use an activation key and configuration channels to deploy the key to the clients. The branch server is based on the Uyuni Proxy. Its activation key must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) The activation key for retail terminal images based on openSUSE Leap 15.5 must contain these child channels: openSUSE Leap 15.5 Updates (x86_64) Uyuni Client Tools for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) 활성화 키 만들기에 대한 자세한 내용은 활성화 키에서 확인할 수 있습니다. You register both the branch server and the terminals as openSUSE clients. To register your openSUSE clients, you need a bootstrap repository. By default, bootstrap repositories are automatically created, and regenerated daily for all synchronized products. You can manually create the bootstrap repository from the command prompt, using this command: mgr-create-bootstrap-repo --with-custom-channels 클라이언트 등록에 대한 자세한 내용은 클라이언트 등록에서 참조하십시오. A retail branch server is registered as an openSUSE proxy. The proxy can be bootstrapped using the Web UI, or at the command prompt. Ensure you use the activation key you created for the proxy. For more information about proxies, see 컨테이너화된 Uyuni 프록시 설정. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. Procedure: Setting Up the Uyuni Proxy Check that the Uyuni Proxy Stable for openSUSE Leap 15.5 (x86_64) channel is assigned to the proxy on the system profile page. At the command prompt on the proxy, as root, install the proxy pattern: zypper in -t pattern uyuni_proxy Finalize the proxy setup: configure-proxy.sh [command]``configure-proxy.sh`` is an interactive script. OPTIONAL: If you want to use the same system also as a build host, navigate to the client’s system profile and check OS Image Build Host as a Add-On System Types.

Channel Information Provides status information for the contents of the channel. Configuration Actions Provides access to the most common configuration tasks. For Salt clients, there is a link to edit the init.sls file. This panel allows you to deploy, compare, and add and create files. Some action are only availalble if you have files created and clients assigned to configuration channels. List/Remove Files This page only appears if there are files in the configuration channel. You can remove files or copy the latest versions into a set of local overrides or into other central configuration channels. Check the box next to files you want to manipulate, then click the action button at the bottom. Add Files The Add Files page has three subtabs of its own, which allow you to Upload, Import, or Create configuration files to be included in the channel. Upload File To upload a file into the configuration channel, browse for the file on your local system, populate all fields, and click the Upload Configuration File button. The Filename/Path field is the absolute path where the file will be deployed. You can set the Ownership via the user name and group name and the Permissions of the file when it is deployed. If the client has SELinux enabled, you can configure SELinux contexts to enable the required file attributes (such as user, role, and file type). If the configuration file includes a macro (a variable in a configuration file), enter the symbol that marks the beginning and end of the macro. For more information on using macros, see reference:configuration/files-locally-managed.adoc#s3-sm-file-macros. Import Files To import files from other configuration channels, including any locally managed channels, check the box to the left of any file you want to import. Then click Import Configuration Files. A sandbox icon () indicates that the listed file is currently located in a local sandbox. Files in a system’s sandbox are considered experimental and could be unstable. Use caution when selecting them for a central configuration channel. Create File Create a configuration file, directory, or symbolic link to be included in the configuration channel. Deploy Files This page only appears when there are files in the channel and a system is subscribed to the channel. Deploy all files by clicking the Deploy All Files button or check selected files and click the Deploy Selected Files button. Select to which systems the files should be applied. All systems subscribed to this channel are listed. If you want to apply the file to a different system, subscribe it to the channel first. To deploy the files, click Confirm & Deploy to Selected Systems. 시스템 Manage systems subscribed to the configuration channel with two subtabs: Subscribed Systems All systems subscribed to the current channel are displayed. Click the name of a system to see the System Details page. To unsubscribe a system from the configuration channel, check the box to the left of the system name and click Unsubscribe systems.

The following section provides configuration tips for spacecmd. Normally spacecmd prompts you for a username and password each time you attempt to login to the interactive shell. Alternatively you can configure spacecmd with a credentials file to avoid this requirement. Procedure: Creating a spacecmd Credentials File Create a hidden spacecmd directory in your home directory and set permissions: mkdir ~/.spacecmd chmod 700 ~/.spacecmd Create a config file in ~/.spacecmd/ and provide proper permissions: touch ~/.spacecmd/config chmod 600 ~/.spacecmd/config Edit the config file and add the following configuration lines. (You can use either localhost or the FQDN of your Uyuni server): [spacecmd] server=FQDN-here username=username-here password=password-here Check connectivity by entering spacecmd as root: # spacecmd By default spacecmd prints server status messages during connection attempts. These messages can cause a lot of clutter when parsing system lists. The following alias will force spacecmd to use quiet mode thus preventing this behavior. Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file: alias spacecmd='spacecmd -q' spacecmd help can be access by typing spacecmd -h --help Usage: spacecmd [options] [command] Options: -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG config file to use [default: ~/.spacecmd/config] -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME use this username to connect to the server -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD use this password to connect to the server -s SERVER, --server=SERVER connect to this server [default: local hostname] --nossl use HTTP instead of HTTPS --nohistory do not store command history -y, --yes answer yes for all questions -q, --quiet print only error messages -d, --debug print debug messages (can be passed multiple times) -h, --help show this help message and exit As root you can access available functions without entering the spacecmd shell: # spacecmd -- help Documented commands (type help <topic>): ======================================== activationkey_addchildchannels org_trustdetails activationkey_addconfigchannels package_details activationkey_addentitlements package_listdependencies activationkey_addgroups package_listerrata activationkey_addpackages package_listinstalledsystems activationkey_clone package_listorphans activationkey_create package_remove activationkey_delete package_removeorphans activationkey_details package_search activationkey_diff repo_addfilters activationkey_disable repo_clearfilters activationkey_disableconfigdeployment repo_create ...","title":"Configuring spacecmd","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"configuring-spacecmd","url":"/uyuni/reference/spacecmd/configuring-spacecmd.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Server are: Eight or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 32 GiB RAM. For installations with thousands of clients, use 64 GB or more. Fast I/O storage devices, such as locally attached SSDs. For PostgreSQL data directories, we recommend locally attached RAID-0 SSDs. If the Uyuni Server is virtualized, enable the elevator=none kernel command line option, for the best input/output performance. You can check the current status with cat /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. This command will display a list of available schedulers with the currently active one in brackets. To change the scheduler before a reboot, use echo none > /sys/block/<DEVICE>/queue/scheduler. The minimum requirements for the Uyuni Proxy are: One Uyuni Proxy per 500-1000 clients, depending on available network bandwidth. Two or more recent x86-64 CPU cores. 16 GB RAM, and sufficient storage for caching. Clients should never be directly attached to the Uyuni Server in production systems. In large scale installations, the Uyuni Proxy is used primarily as a local cache for content between the server and clients. Using proxies in this way can substantially reduce download time for clients, and decrease Server egress bandwidth use. The number of clients per proxy will affect the download time. Always take network structure and available bandwidth into account. We recommend you estimate the download time of typical usage to determine how many clients to connnect to each proxy. To do this, you will need to estimate the number of package upgrades required in every patch cycle. You can use this formula to calculate the download time: Size of updates * Number of clients / Theoretical download speed / 60 For example, the total time needed to transfer 400 MB of upgrades through a physical link speed of 1 GB/s to 3000 clients: 400 MB * 3000 / 119 MB/s / 60 = 169 min","title":"Hardware Requirements","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hardware-reqs","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hardware-reqs.html","titles":[]},"457":{"id":457,"text":"When XMLRPC API is running, connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Relay mode: the credentials used to authenticate with the Hub are also used to authenticate to each server. You must provide a list of servers to connect to. Auto-connect mode: credentials are reused for each server, and any peripheral server you have access to is automatically connected. This section provides examples of each authentication method. Example: Manual Authentication In manual mode, credentials have to be explicitly provided for each peripheral server before you can connect to it. A typical workflow for manual authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the login method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method. Credentials for each peripheral server are provided to the attachToServers method. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. If you want to call a method on just one Uyuni Server, then Hub API also provides a unicast namespace. In this case, the response will be a single value and not a map, in the same way as if you called that Uyuni server’s API directly. Listing 1. Example Python Script for Manual Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"<HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL>\" HUB_USERNAME = \"<USERNAME>\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"<PASSWORD>\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.login(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # For simplicity, this example assumes you are using the same username and password here, as on the hub server. # However, in most cases, every server has its own individual credentials. usernames = [HUB_USERNAME for s in serverIds] passwords = [HUB_PASSWORD for s in serverIds] # Each server uses the credentials set above, client.hub.attachToServers needs # them passed as lists with as many elements as there are servers. client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds, usernames, passwords) # Perform the operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Relay Authentication In relay authentication mode, the credentials used to sign in to the Hub API are also used to sign in into the APIs of the peripheral servers the user wants to work with. In this authentication mode, it is assumed that the same credentials are valid for every server, and that they correspond to a user with appropriate permissions. After signing in, you must call the attachToServers method. This method defines the servers to target in all subsequent calls. A typical workflow for relay authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAuthRelayMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). Using the session key from the previous step, Uyuni Server IDs are obtained for all the peripheral servers attached to the Hub via the hub.listServerIds method A call to attachToServers is made, and the same credentials used to sign in to the Hub are passed to each server. This performs authentication against each server’s XMLRPC API endpoint. A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers the call failed. Listing 2. Example Python Script for Relay Authentication: #!/usr/bin/python3 import xmlrpc.client HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL = \"<HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL>\" HUB_USERNAME = \"<USERNAME>\" HUB_PASSWORD = \"<PASSWORD>\" client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(HUB_XMLRPC_API_URL, verbose=0) hubSessionKey = client.hub.loginWithAuthRelayMode(HUB_USERNAME, HUB_PASSWORD) # Get the server IDs serverIds = client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey) # Authenticate those servers(same credentials will be used as of hub to authenticate) client.hub.attachToServers(hubSessionKey, serverIds) # Perform the needed operation systemsPerServer = client.multicast.system.list_systems(hubSessionKey, serverIds) successfulResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Successful\"][\"Responses\"] failedResponses = systemsPerServer[\"Failed\"][\"Responses\"] for system in successfulResponses: print(system) # Log out client.hub.logout(hubSessionKey) Example: Auto-Connect Authentication Auto-connect mode is similar to relay mode, it uses the Hub credentials to sign in in to all peripheral servers. However, there is no need to use the attachToServers method, as auto-connect mode connects to all available peripheral servers. This occurs at the same time as you sign in to the Hub. A typical workflow for auto-connect authentication is: Credentials for the Hub are passed to the loginWithAutoconnectMode method, and a session key for the Hub is returned (hubSessionKey). A multicast call is performed on a set of servers. This is defined by serverIds, which contains the IDs of the servers to target. In the background, system.list_system is called on each server’s XMLRPC API. Hub aggregates the results and returns the response in the form of a map. The map has two entries: Successful: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call succeeded. Failed: list of responses for those peripheral servers where the call failed. Listing 3.

For Uyuni API documentation, see https://documentation.suse.com/MLM. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the Uyuni API. The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces: The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication. The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly. The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map. If you do not specify a namespace, all calls are transparently redirected to the underlying Uyuni Server XMLRPC API of the Hub Server. This allows you to call all available methods on the Uyuni Server XMLRPC API. Methods called without specifying any of the above namespaces will be forwarded to the normal XMLRPC API of the hub. This is the API exposed on ports 80 and 443. Some important considerations for hub namespaces: Individual server IDs can be obtained using client.hub.listServerIds(hubSessionKey). The unicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey and serverID as their first two parameters, then any other parameter as specified by the regular Server API. client.unicast.[namespace].[methodName](hubSessionKey, serverId, param1, param2) The hubSessionKey can be obtained using different authentication methods. For more information, see Hub XMLRPC API Authentication Modes. The multicast namespace assumes all methods receive hubSessionKey, a list of ServerID values, then lists of per-server parameters as specified by the regular server XMLRPC API. The return value is a map, with Successful and Failed entries for each server involved in the call. client.multicast.[namespace].[methodname](hubSessionKey, [serverId1, serverId2], [param1_s1, param1_s2], [param2_s1, param2_s2])","title":"Hub XMLRPC API Namespaces","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-namespaces","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html","titles":[]},"462":{"id":462,"text":"Hub online synchronization reuses the existing repository synchronization and synchronizes channels in the peripheral servers from the repositories on the hub server. When the connection between hub and peripheral server is established, the hub server becomes the main source of data for the peripheral server. In case of vendor channels, hub server is effectively replacing SUSE Customer Center. In case of custom channels, when they are synchronized, the peripheral server will fetch the packages from the hub and not from the original location of the custom channel defined on the hub. The main characteristics of this feature are: There can only be one hub server per connection, with one or more peripheral servers. Each peripheral server can only have one hub server. Content can be synchronized on regular basis, or on demand. Hub online synchronization is configured from menu Admin Hub Configuration. Configuration process uses token which uniquely identifies peripheral server’s connection to the hub. There are two ways to register a peripheral server to the hub server: by using a combination of token creation on the peripheral, and subsequent registration on the hub server. This method uses Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server and Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token. by direct registration from the hub, without any user interactions with the peripheral server. This method is described in Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server. Before being registered to the hub server, a token needs to be generated on the peripheral server and passed to the administrator of the hub server. Procedure: Generating token on the peripheral server On the peripheral server, go to Admin Hub Configuration Access Tokens. Click button Add token and select option Issue new token. In the field Server FQDN on the form that opens type the FQDN of the hub server that will be using this token. Click Issue. A new form with the successfully generated token appears and button Copy. The only time token is displayed is at the time of its creation. Save it in a safe place until it is later needed. Once generated, the token appears on the screen Access Tokens. The generated token needs to be transferred to the hub server before it can be used. Procedure: Registering to the hub server with the token On the hub server, go to Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Existing token. In the field Token paste the token that was created on the peripheral server. In the field Root CA certificate specify the certificate using one of the options: Use option Not needed if both hub and peripheral servers have the same certificate authority. Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate to paste a certificate. Click button Register. A newly registered peripheral server will appear on screen Peripherals Configuration. It is possible to initiate the registration of a peripheral server from hub server, without any interaction with the peripheral server. Procedure: Direct registering from the hub server On the hub server, go to Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. Click button Add peripheral. A new form Register a new peripheral server opens. In the field Peripheral Server FQDN enter the name of the peripheral server. In the field Registration mode select option Administrator User/Password. In the fields Username and Password enter the credentials for the peripheral server. The credentials must be those of SUSE Manager Administrator of the peripheral server. In the field Root CA certificate specify the certificate using one of the options: Use option Not needed if both hub and peripheral servers have the same certificate authority. Use option Upload a file if the servers have different certificate authorities to upload a certificate file. Use option Paste a PEM certificate in cases when PEM certificate is used. Click button Register. The newly registered peripheral server will be shown in the Systems System List with the value Foreign in the column System Type. To access its details, click on the peripheral server’s name and select tab Details Peripheral Server. Peripheral server uses hub to access the vendor channels and does not connect to the SUSE Customer Center directly. Therefore, if you open configured peripheral server’s page Admin Setup Wizard Organization Credentials, Admin Setup Wizard Products or Admin Setup Wizard PAYG Connections, you will see a notification that this is peripheral server and its connections are managed via hub. All existing tokens are shown in Hub Configuration Access Tokens. A token can viewed as Consumed and Issued, both from the perspective of the peripheral and the hub server. From the perspective of the peripheral server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the peripheral server and received by the hub server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the hub server to be used by the peripheral server. From the perspective of the hub server: Consumed The Consumedtoken is generated on the hub server and received by the peripheral server to be used. Issued The Issued token is issued by the peripheral server to be used by the hub server. A token can be invalidated, or deleted. Be careful when using option Invalidate as it no longer grants access to the other server. This operation ensures that no communication will happen until a new token is generated if the existing one is compromised, or until the current token is reactivated. Invalidated token can be made valid again at any time. It is possible to delete a token. Deleting is only possible when the server associated with the token is not registered as hub or peripheral. This operation cannot be undone. Every peripheral server stores the information about its hub server. A peripheral server can only have one hub server configured. Procedure: Accessing hub server details On the peripheral server, go to Hub Configuration Hub Details. On the screen Hub Details find the information about the hub server. Field Server FQDN shows the hub server’s FQDN. Field Registration date shows the time when the peripheral server was registered to the hub server. Field Last modified shows the time of the last saved configuration change. Field Root Certificate Authority shows certificate details. To download, edit or delete the root certificate, clicking Download, Edit or Delete respectively. Deleting the certificate will break the connection between servers. Field GPG Public Key shows whether the GPG key has been configured for the hub server. For more information about GPG keys between hub and peripheral servers, see GPG key usage with hub online synhronization. Field Mirror credentials is the username the peripheral server uses when connecting to the hub server to synchronize vendor channels. This username is generated automatically on the hub server, and then transmitted to the peripheral server during the registration phase. When the metadata on the hub server are signed with a GPG key, the public key is automatically transmitted from hub to peripheral server. By default, Uyuni is not signing metadata. Therefore, when the peripheral server is downloading data from the hub server there is no way of checking if the downloaded metadata have a valid signature, unless the customer has created their own GPG key. To enable checking of the data integrity, the GPG key needs to be created on the hub. When the peripheral server is configured to communicate with the hub, the public GPG key will then automatically be transferred to it. When the GPG key is created on the hub, field GPG Public Key will be set to show that this server is using the GPG key. For more information about setting up own GPG key, see 리포지토리 메타데이터. Deregistration can happen from both sides, from the hub or from the peripheral server. Procedure: Deregistering from the peripheral server Go to Hub Configuration Hub Details. Click Deregister. Confirm the operation by clicking Deregister on the pop-up window. Page Hub Configuration Hub Details is now empty. Procedure: Deregistering from the hub server Go to Hub Configuration Peripheral Configuration. Find the perpheral server on the list. Click Deregister next to the peripheral server’s name. The peripheral server is no longer shown on the list. Synchronizing vendor channels for the configured hub and server is done via dedicated user interface. Procedure: Synchronizing channels from hub to peripheral server Go to Admin Hub Configuration Peripherals Configuration. In the field Synchronized channels click on Edit channels. Page Sync Channels from Hub to Peripheral opens. Select the channels you want to synchronize. For Custom Channels also select the target organization on the peripheral from the dropdown. The drop-down list only exists on custom channels which do not yet exist on the peripheral server. If the channel exists, the organization will stay unchanged. Click Apply Changes to view the summary of your changes. A pop-up window with the summary of your selections will open. Click Confirm to confirm the selection. Now channels will be created on the peripheral server and everything will be set up to mirror the channels with the next regular repository synchronization task. + The repository synchronization will not start immediately after clicking the confirmation button.","title":"Hub Online Synchronization","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"hub-online-sync","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-online-sync.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The goal of the reporting feature is to get data from these Servers back and have combined reporting data available on the Hub. The data is made available for external Reporting Tools. The main database is a PostgreSQL database in the Uyuni Hub system. It stores all the information collected from all the servers, and aggregates them. Every peripheral Server has its own reporting database where the information is collected for that system. In summary: the DB in Uyuni Hub stores, collects and aggregates data coming from all the DBs of the peripheral Servers, the DB in Uyuni Hub stores also its own data from the systems directly connected and managed by the Hub, the DB in peripheral Uyuni Server stores its own data, the reporting tool can be connected either to the Hub or to any Uyuni Server. The reporting database and schema are set up by default using the local PostgreSQL server. The reporting database is a separate database accessible via the network. As a requirement we expect all server certificates are signed by the same Root Certificate Authority (CA). The whole Uyuni Hub environment should be using only one Root CA. For more information about certificates, see specialized-guides:large-deployments/hub-reqs.adoc#lsd-hub-reqs-certs. Before connecting an external Reporting Tools to the Database, a user with read-only permission should be created. For doing that, it is possible to use uyuni-setup-reportdb-user. usage: uyuni-setup-reportdb-user [options] options: --help show this help message and exit --non-interactive Switches to non-interactive mode --dbuser=DBUSER Report DB User --dbpassword=DBPASSWORD Report DB Password --add Add the new user --delete Delete the user --modify Set a new password The schema exports the most important tables from the main Uyuni Database as a de-normalized variant containing only data which are relevant for a report. Ready-to-use reports are provided as views, aggregating data over multiple tables. Every table gets an extra id column (mgm_id) specifying the Uyuni server which provided the data. On a single Uyuni Server this column has the standard value 1 which represent localhost. On the Uyuni Hub it is replaced with the real server id the managed server has in the hub database. Another common additional field is synced_date, which represents the time when the data were exported from the main Uyuni Server database. Navigate to Help Report Database Schema to find the schema documentation. Uyuni uses taskomatic jobs to generate the data for the reporting database and to get the data from the peripheral servers to the hub. To generate and update the data on a peripheral server, the responsible schedule is called update-reporting-default. It is executed by default daily at midnight. On the Uyuni Hub there is a second schedule which is important. To fetch the reporting data from all registered peripheral servers, the task with the name update-reporting-hub-default is executed daily at 1:30 AM. All times are in the local timezone of the server. If the peripheral servers are in different timezones, it is recommended to align all the schedules. Make sure that all reporting data are gathered at a specific point in time, and update-reporting-hub-default is running when all peripheral servers have actually finished their local jobs.

Prometheus and Grafana packages are included in the Uyuni Client Tools for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12, SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, CentOS 7, CentOS 8 and openSUSE 15.x. You need to install Prometheus and Grafana on a machine separate from the Uyuni Server. We recommend you use a managed client as your monitoring server. It is recommended to monitor the Salt event bus in the large scale deployments with Saline to identify possible bottlenecks.

Always start small and scale up gradually. Monitor the server as you scale to identify problems early. The rate at which Uyuni can onboard clients is limited and depends on hardware resources. Onboarding clients at a faster rate than Uyuni is configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys. This slows down the process and can potentially exhaust resources. We recommend that you limit the acceptance key rate programmatically. A safe starting point would be to onboard a client every 15 seconds. You can do that with this command: for k in $(salt-key -l un|grep -v Unaccepted); do salt-key -y -a $k; sleep 15; done All communication to and from clients is encrypted. During client onboarding, Salt uses asymmetric cryptography, which requires available entropy from the Random Number Generator (RNG) facility in the kernel. If sufficient entropy is not available from the RNG, it will significantly slow down communications. This is especially true in virtualized environments. Ensure enough entropy is present, or change the virtualization host options. You can check the amount of available entropy with the cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail. It should never be below 100-200. Idle clients which have not been onboarded, that is clients running with unaccepted Salt keys, consume more resources than idle clients that have been onboarded. Generally, this consumes about an extra 2.5 Kb/s of inbound network bandwidth per client. For example, 1000 idle clients will consume about 2.5 Mb/s extra. This consumption will reduce almost to zero when onboarding has been completed for all clients. Limit the number of non-onboarded clients for optimal performance. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt Mine to check client availability. The Salt Mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. Since the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt Mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered clients will have the Salt Mine disabled by default. If the Salt Mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt Mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing. Do not end the process with Ctrl+C. To minimize wasted resources, you can disable non-essential or unused Taskomatic jobs. You can see the list of Taskomatic jobs in the Uyuni Web UI, at Admin Task Schedules. To disable a job, click the name of the job you want to disable, select Disable Schedule, and click Update Schedule. To delete a job, click the name of the job you want to delete, and click Delete Schedule. We recommend disabling these jobs: Daily comparison of configuration files: compare-configs-default Hourly synchronization of Cobbler files: cobbler-sync-default Daily gatherer and subscription matcher: gatherer-matcher-default Do not attempt to disable any other jobs, as it could prevent Uyuni from functioning correctly. It is especially important in large scale deployments that you keep your Uyuni Server constantly monitored and backed up. Swap space use can have significant impacts on performance. If significant non-transient swap usage is detected, you can increase the available hardware RAM. You can also consider tuning the Server to consume less memory. For more information on tuning, see Scaling Minions (Large Scale Deployments). Communications from the Salt Master to clients is encrypted with a single AES key. The key is rotated when: The salt-master process is restarted, or Any minion key is deleted (for example, when a client is deleted from Uyuni) After the AES key has been rotated, all clients must re-authenticate to the master. By default, this happens next time a client receives a message. If you have a large number of clients (several thousands), this can cause a high CPU load on the Uyuni Server. If the CPU load is excessive, we recommend that you delete keys in batches, and in off-peak hours if possible, to avoid overloading the server.

There are two main ways to manage large scale deployments. You can manage them with a single Uyuni Server, or you can use multiple servers in a hub. Both methods are described in this book. With large scale environments one should also consider the usage of Uyuni Proxies. Sizing and location of the Proxies will dependent on the deployment topology. For more information, see Install Uyuni Proxy. Additionally, if you are operating within a Retail environment, you can use Uyuni for Retail to manage large deployments of point-of-service terminals.

It uses the same technology as SUSE Multi-Linux Manager, but is customized to address the needs of retail organizations. Uyuni for Retail is designed for use in retail situations where customers can use point-of-service terminals to purchase or exchange goods, take part in promotions, or collect loyalty points. In addition to retail installations, it can also be used for novel purposes, such as maintaining student computers in an educational environment, or self-service kiosks in banks or hospitals. Uyuni for Retail is intended for use in installations that include servers, workstations, point-of-service terminals, and other devices. It allows administrators to install, configure, and update the software on their servers, and manage the deployment and provisioning of point-of-service machines. Point-of-Service (POS) terminals can come in many different formats, such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, digital scales, self-service systems, and reverse-vending systems. Every terminal, however, is provided by a vendor, who set basic information about the device in the firmware. Uyuni for Retail accesses this vendor information to determine how best to work with the terminal in use. In most cases, different terminals will require a different operating system (OS) image to ensure they work correctly. For example, an information kiosk has a high-resolution touchscreen, where a cashier terminal might only have a very basic display. While both of these terminals require similar processing and network functionality, they will require different OS images. The OS images ensure that the different display mechanisms work correctly.

For installations with more than 1000 clients per Uyuni Server, adequate hardware sizing and parameter tuning must be performed. The instructions in this section can have severe and catastrophic performance impacts when improperly used. In some cases, they can cause Uyuni to completely cease functioning. Always test changes before implementing them in a production environment. During implementation, take care when changing parameters. Monitor performance before and after each change, and revert any steps that do not produce the expected result. Tuning is not required on installations of fewer than 1000 clients. Do not perform these instructions on small or medium scale installations. Any Uyuni installation is subject to a number of design and infrastructure constraints that, for the purposes of tuning, we call environmental variables. Environmental variables can include the total number of clients, the number of different operating systems under management, and the number of software channels. Environmental variables influence, either directly or indirectly, the value of most configuration parameters. During the tuning process, the configuration parameters are manipulated to improve system performance. Before you begin tuning, you will need to estimate the best setting for each environment variable, and adjust the configuration parameters to suit. To help you with the estimation process, we have provided you with a dependency graph. Locate the environmental variables on the dependency graph to determine how they will influence other variables and parameters. Environmental variables are represented by graph nodes in a rectangle at the top of the dependency graph. Each node is connected to the relevant parameters that might need tuning. Consult the relevant sections in this document for more information about recommended values. Tuning one parameter might require tuning other parameters, or changing hardware, or the infrastructure. When you change a parameter, follow the arrows from that node on the graph to determine what other parameters might need adjustment. Continue through each parameter until you have visited all nodes on the graph. Key to the Dependency Graph 3D boxes are hardware design variables or constraints Oval-shaped boxes are software or system design variables or constraints Rectangle-shaped boxes are configurable parameters, color-coded by configuration file: Red: Apache httpd configuration files Blue: Salt configuration files Brown: Tomcat configuration files Grey: PostgreSQL configuration files Purple: /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Dashed connecting lines indicate a variable or constraint that might require a change to another parameter Solid connecting lines indicate that changing a configuration parameter requires checking another one to prevent issues After the initial tuning has been completed, you will need to consider tuning again in these cases: If your tuning inputs change significantly If special conditions arise that require a certain parameter to be changed. For example, if specific warnings appear in a log file. If performance is not satisfactory To re-tune your installation, you will need to use the dependency graph again. Start from the node where significant change has happened. This section contains information about environmental variables (inputs to the tuning process). Network Bandwidth A measure of the typically available egress bandwith from the Uyuni Server host to the clients or Uyuni Proxy hosts. This should take into account network hardware and topology as well as possible capacity limits on switches, routers, and other network equipment between the server and clients. Channel count The number of expected channels to manage. Includes any vendor-provided, third-party, and cloned or staged channels. Client count The total number of actual or expected clients. It is important to tune any parameters in advance of a client count increase, whenever possible. OS mix The number of distinct operating system versions that managed clients have installed. This is ordered by family (SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or Ubuntu based). Storage and computing requirements are different in each case. User count The expected maximum amount of concurrent users interacting with the Web UI plus the number of programs simultaneously using the XMLRPC API. Includes spacecmd, spacewalk-clone-by-date, and similar. This section contains information about the available parameters.

After java.salt_presence_ping_timeout seconds have elapsed without a response, a second command (in most cases state.apply or any other Salt function) is sent to the client and if there is no response from the client for the amount of seconds specified with this parameter one more call (saltutil.find_job) is sent for a final check. This parameter sets the number of seconds after the second command after which the client is definitely considered timeout. Having many clients typically means some will respond faster than others, so this timeout could be raised to accommodate for the slower ones. Tune when Client count increases significantly, or some clients are responding correctly but too slowly, and Uyuni excludes them from calls. This line appears in /var/log/rhn/rhn_web_ui.log: \"Got no result for <COMMAND> on minion <MINION_ID> (minion did not respond in time)\" Value default 1 second Value recommendation 1-50 seconds Location /etc/rhn/rhn.conf Example java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout = 20 More information Salt Timeouts Description Whenever content is changed in a software channel, its metadata needs to be recomputed before clients can use it. Channel-altering operations include the addition of a patch, the removal of a package or a repository synchronization run. This parameter specifies the maximum number of Taskomatic threads that Uyuni will use to recompute the channel metadata. Channel metadata computation is both CPU-bound and memory-heavy, so raising this parameter and operating on many channels simultaneously could cause Taskomatic to consume significant resources, but channels will be available to clients sooner. Tune when Channel count becomes larger than 50, or more concurrent operations on channels are expected.

If any of those components requires more concurrent connections, their requests will be queued. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or maxThreads increase significantly, or when org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount has changed significantly. Each thread consumes one connection in Taskomatic and Tomcat, having more threads than connections might result in starving.

More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS Description Maximum number of PostgreSQL connections available to applications. More connections allow for more concurrent threads/workers in various components (in particular Tomcat and Taskomatic), which generally improves performance. However, each connection consumes resources, in particular work_mem megabytes per sort operation per connection. Tune when hibernate.c3p0.max_size changes significantly, as that parameter determines the maximum number of connections available to Tomcat and Taskomatic Value default 400 Value recommendation Depends on other settings, use /usr/lib/susemanager/bin/susemanager-connection-check to obtain a recommendation. Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example max_connections = 250 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS Description The amount of memory allocated by PostgreSQL every time a connection needs to do a sort or hash operation. Every connection (as specified by max_connections) might make use of an amount of memory equal to a multiple of work_mem. Tune when Database operations are slow because of excessive temporary file disk I/O. To test if that is happening, add log_temp_files = 5120 to /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf, restart PostgreSQL, and monitor the PostgreSQL log files. If you see lines containing LOG: temporary file: try raising this parameter’s value to help reduce disk I/O and speed up database operations. Value recommendation 2-20 MB Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example work_mem = 10MB After changing check if the Uyuni Server might need additional RAM. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM Description Estimation of the total memory available to PostgreSQL for caching. It is the explicitly reserved memory (shared_buffers) plus any memory used by the kernel as cache/buffer. Tune when Hardware RAM or memory usage increase significantly Value recommendation Start with 75% of total RAM. For finer settings, use shared_buffers + free memory + buffer/cache memory. Free and buffer/cache can be determined via the free -m command (free and buff/cache in the output respectively) Location /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf Example effective_cache_size = 24GB After changing Check memory usage Notes This is an estimation for the query planner, not an allocation. More information https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE Description The number of worker threads serving Salt API HTTP requests. A higher number can improve parallelism of Uyuni Server-initiated Salt operations, but will consume more memory. Tune when java.message_queue_thread_pool_size or org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount are changed. Starvation can occur when there are more Tomcat or Taskomatic threads making simultaneous Salt API calls than there are Salt API worker threads. Value default 100 Value recommendation 100-500, but should be higher than the sum of java.message_queue_thread_pool_size and org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount Location /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf, in the rest_cherrypy section. Example thread_pool: 100 After changing Check worker_threads for adjustment. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#performance-tuning Description The number of salt-master worker threads that process commands and replies from minions and the Salt API. Increasing this value, assuming sufficient resources are available, allows Salt to process more data in parallel from minions without timing out, but will consume significantly more RAM (typically about 70 MiB per thread). Setting this value to very high values could cause opposite effect as the workers will compete to each other for the CPU resources and the performance could be dropped significantly. Tune when Client count increases significantly, thread_pool increases significantly, or SaltReqTimeoutError or Message timed out errors appear in /var/log/salt/master could be a sign of too low or too high value of this parameter. Value default 8 Value recommendation 8-32, depending on the number of the CPU cores available for the server, it is recommended to keep the value slightly less than the number of CPU cores. Location /etc/salt/master.d/tuning.conf Example worker_threads: 16 After changing Check memory usage. Monitor memory usage closely before and after the change. It makes sense to monitor the salt-master stats event by enabling master_stats and adjusting master_stats_event_iter to fine tune the value of this parameter. More information https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#worker-threads Description Determines whether the master will fire authentication events. Authentication events are fired when a minion performs an authentication check with the master.

It is important that the amount of hardware RAM is adequate after any significant change. To determine how RAM is being used, you will need to check each process that consumes it. Operating system Stop all Uyuni services and inspect the output of free -h. Java-based components This includes Taskomatic, Tomcat, and rhn-search. These services support a configurable memory cap. The Uyuni Server Depends on many factors and can only be estimated. Measure PostgreSQL reserved memory by checking shared_buffers, permanently. You can also multiply work_mem and max_connections, and multiply by three for a worst case estimate of per-query RAM. You will also need to check the operating system buffers and caches, which are used by PostgreSQL to host copies of database data. These often automatically occupy any available RAM. It is important that the Uyuni Server has sufficient RAM to accommodate all of these processes, especially OS buffers and caches, to have reasonable PostgreSQL performance. We recommend you keep several gigabytes available at all times, and add more as the database size on disk increases. Whenever the expected amount of memory available for OS buffers and caches changes, update the effective_cache_size parameter to have PostgreSQL use it correctly. You can calculate the total available by finding the total RAM available, less the expected memory usage. To get a live breakdown of the memory used by services on the Uyuni Server, use this command: pidstat -p ALL -r --human 1 60 | tee pidstat-memory.log This command will save a copy of displayed data in the pidstat-memory.log file for later analysis.","title":"Tuning Large Scale Deployments","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"tuning","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/large-deployments/tuning.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Prepare your clients on physical or virtual hardware, and ensure you have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP installation media ready. You cannot create an SAP cluster without the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SAP extension, as it provides tooling specific to SAP. One of the key features of SAP is high availability of the cluster. Every component within an SAP cluster has redundancy and failover protection. When you are preparing your clients, ensure you have enough hardware and infrastructure to allow for this. For more information about hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles-sap/15-SP4/html/SLES-SAP-installation/cha-plan.html#sec-hardware For more information about the clients you need to set up for an SAP cluster, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. Each client within your SAP cluster must be registered with the SUSE Customer Center. To obtain your registration code, navigate to https://scc.suse.com/login in your web browser. Log in to your SCC account, or follow the prompts to create a new account. Click the Subscriptions tab to see the registration code. When you install SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 for SAP the Unified Installer prompts you for the code. For more information about registering Uyuni with SUSE Customer Center, see 일반 요구사항. Every client system must have all the other client systems listed in their /etc/hosts file. Open the /etc/hosts file on each client, and add the hostname for each of the other clients. Each of the clients needs to be able to access a shared disk. The shared disk can be physical hardware connected by ethernet, or you can set up a virtual disk and access it with iSCSI. If you use a virtual disk, consider hosting it on a separate system. Do not use a client machine to host the shared storage disk. Download the SAP installation media and save a copy on each client. The software that you require differs depending on your environment. For example, if you are using HANA, you need the SAP HANA platform. If you are using Netweaver, you need different packages. These software packages are provided by SAP, not by SUSE. Ensure you have saved the installation software in the same file system location on each client. Alternatively, save it to a shared NFS drive. Each client needs to be configured to use the latest version of module.run. On each of the client machines, open the /etc/salt/minion configuration file and add or edit this line: use_superseded: - module.run Restart the salt-minion process to enable the changes: systemctl restart salt-minion For the clients that are going to run the HANA database, you require an additional storage device. This device is used to store files required by HANA, which are located in the /hana/ directory. We recommend that this storage device be at least 20 GB. For some installations, you might require more, and it is possible to use multiple disks to provide this storage. For comprehensive hardware requirements, see https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all. First of all, make sure you have an activation key that is associated with the SLE-Product-SLES_SAP15 base channel. For more information about activation keys, see 활성화 키. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Systems Bootstrapping. Fill in the appropriate details, and make sure you check the Manage System Completely via SSH checkbox.

There are no common recommendations for all the possible use cases as the environments could be very different expecially if public clouds instances are involved. In case clients are losing the connection to the Uyuni Server (or Uyuni Proxy if involved), they are unreachable from the Uyuni Server Web UI or with command line tools. To understand such a connection issue check if the client is not reachable from the Uyuni Server with salt MINION_ID test.ping, while venv-salt-call test.ping (or salt-call test.ping if non-bundle Salt is used on the client) is working fine on the client side. If this is the case, it is recommended to set tcp_keepalive parameters. The parameters with the values from the example below can be used as a starting point to look for settings, which could prevent cases of connection loss without restoring for some environments. It is recommended to put the parameters in the separate drop-in configuration file like /etc/venv-salt-minion/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf or /etc/salt/minion.d/tuning-keepalives.conf, depending on the minion type used on the client side. Listing 1. Example: Keepalive Parameters Example Values ###### Keepalive settings ###### ############################################ # ZeroMQ now includes support for configuring SO_KEEPALIVE if supported by # the OS. If connections between the minion and the master pass through # a state tracking device such as a firewall or VPN gateway, there is # the risk that it could tear down the connection the master and minion # without informing either party that their connection has been taken away. # Enabling TCP Keepalives prevents this from happening. # Overall state of TCP Keepalives, enable (1 or True), disable (0 or False) # or leave to the OS defaults (-1), on Linux, typically disabled. Default True, enabled. tcp_keepalive: True # How long before the first keepalive should be sent in seconds. Default 300 # to send the first keepalive after 5 minutes, OS default (-1) is typically 7200 seconds # on Linux see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time. tcp_keepalive_idle: 10 # How many lost probes are needed to consider the connection lost. Default -1 # to use OS defaults, typically 9 on Linux, see /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes. tcp_keepalive_cnt: 3 # How often, in seconds, to send keepalives after the first one. Default -1 to # use OS defaults, typically 75 seconds on Linux, see # /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl. tcp_keepalive_intvl: 10 salt-broker service is used on Uyuni Proxies to forward Salt traffic between the Uyuni Server and salt-minion service used on the client side. It is possible that salt-broker and all the clients behind it could be affected with the same issue as the clients directly connected to the Uyuni Server. The issue could be fixed with the same parameters as recommended for the minions, but specified in /etc/salt/broker on each Uyuni Proxy. Uyuni Proxy connectivity can also suffer when the connectivity to the Uyuni Server is lost for a quite long interval. In such a case Proxy connected clients started to retry the authentication to the salt-master service on the Uyuni Server. This situation could be potentially dangerous because it could lead to collecting large amount of ZeroMQ messages with authentication attemps in the interal buffer of ZeroMQ sockets used inside the salt-broker service. Then, on restoring the connection to the salt-master all of the pending messages will be pushed to it. It could lead to the issues on Uyuni Server side with salt-master service, because it could be impossible to serve all the cached requests in appropriate time or even to the complete denial of the service. To avoid such situation a set of tuning parameters is available. As the most important one, wait_for_backend should be set to True. This prevents opening the sockets for the clients behind the proxy while the connectivity to the salt-master service is not established. In this case the messages from the clients are not collected in the internal buffers. drop_after_retries is setting the number of retries before closing the sockets to drop the cached messages. The other parameters could help to fine tune the behavior for the environment. Setting timeouts, intervals and drop_after_retries to lower values are making salt-broker service more aggressive on detecting the connection loss to the salt-master, so that it puts the clients behind the proxy to the conditions closer as they are connected directly to the Uyuni Server. Increasing the values could provide some benefits in case if the network channel between the Uyuni Proxy and Uyuni Server is not stable enough, the message buffering can provide some flexibility while re-establishing the connection.

The clients can be successfully bootstrapped without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new third party packages or update them until the keys are trusted. Salt clients are set to trust SUSE tools channels GPG keys when they are bootstrapped. For all other clients and channels, you need to manually trust third party GPG keys. If you are bootstrapping Salt clients from the Uyuni Web UI, you can use a custom Salt state to trust the GPG key. Procedure: Trusting a GPG Key With a Custom Salt State Locate the key that you need to trust. Ensure you have the correct key, and that you also have the fingerprint used to verify the key. This information is available from the vendor or, in some cases, from a key server. Copy the key to a file location where the client can access it. We recommend saving it in the /srv/www/htdocs/pub/ directory, where all user public files must be saved. In the Uyuni Web UI, navigate to Configuration Channels. Click Create State Channel. In the Name field, type a name for your state. For example, GPG Key Trusts. In the Label field, type a label. For example, GPG_Key_Trusts. In the Description field, type a short description of the configuration your state performs. For example, Trusts GPG Keys for CentOS. In the SLS Contents field, create a state to retrieve the appropriate key from the Uyuni Server and trust it on the client. The exact contents of your state varies depending on your client operating system. For example: rpm_trust_gpg_key: cmd.run: - name: rpm --import https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey-<key_id> deb_trust_gpg_key: mgrcompat.module_run: - name: pkg.add_repo_key - path: https://{{ salt['pillar.get']('mgr_server') }}/pub/<third-party-gpg>.key Alternatively, you can add GPG keys to a configuration channel, using a managed file to deploy them directly on the client. In this case, you would use a local path to the key, rather than a URL. . Click btn:[Update Channel] to save your state. . Navigate to menu:Configuration[Channels] and click the name of the state you want to assign a client to. . Navigate to the menu:Systems[Target Systems] tab and check the clients you want to assign. . Click btn:[Subscribe systems]. When the configuration file is next run on the client, the GPG key is trusted. Alternatively, you can manage your GPG keys from your own repository hosted on an external file management system. To apply a custom state at highstate create a mapping in /srv/salt/top.sls. This short example maps the test state to the system group 12: # /srv/salt/top.sls base: 'group_ids:12': - match: pillar - test","title":"Custom Salt States","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-custom-states","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-custom-states.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This section describes how Salt is supported and set up as part of Uyuni Server. The main configuration file is /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf. Do not edit the /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf configuration file. This file belongs to the spacewalk-setup package and is marked as %config. When SUSE updates the spacewalk-setup package, the susemanager.conf file is overwritten, and any customization is lost. Instead, add your own configuration file to the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This prevents the update process from deleting your settings from the main susemanager.conf configuration file. Some settings from /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf that can help with finding configuration options: # Configure different file roots.

POS terminals will use the DNS on the branch server for name resolution of Saltboot specific hostnames. When you are configuring the Bind formula for a branch server with a dedicated internal network, check that you are using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on both the external and internal branch networks. If the FQDN does not match on both networks, the branch server will not be recognized as a proxy server. The following procedure outlines a standard configuration with two zones. Adjust it to suit your own environment. Zone 1 is a regular domain zone. Its main purpose is to resolveSaltboot hostnames such as TFTP, FTP, or Salt. It can also resolve the terminal names if configured. Zone 2 is the reverse zone of Zone 1. Its main purpose is to resolve IP addresses back to hostnames. Zone 2 is primarily needed for the correct determination of the FQDNs of the branch. Procedure: Configuring Bind with Two Zones Check the Bind formula, click Save, and navigate to the Formulas Bind tab. In the Config section, select Include Forwarders. In the Configured Zones section, use these parameters for Zone 1: In the Name field, enter the domain name of your branch network (for example: branch1.example.com). In the Type field, select master.

The formula is used only for connecting Uyuni Proxy 4.3. with Uyuni Server 5.0. Do not use this formula if you want to connect Uyuni Proxy 5.0. The branch server can be configured to use networking in many different ways. The most common ways provide either a dedicated or shared LAN for terminals. In this configuration, the branch server requires at least two network interfaces: one acts as a WAN to communicate with the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server, and the other one acts as an isolated LAN to communicate with terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Dedicated LAN In the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC checked. In the NIC field, enter the name of the network device that is connected to the internal LAN. In the IP field, enter the static IP address to be assigned to the branch server on the internal LAN. In the Netmask field, enter the network mask of the internal LAN. Check Enable Route if you want the branch server to route traffic from internal LAN to WAN. Check Enable NAT if you want the branch server to convert addresses from internal LAN to WAN. Select the bind DNS forwarder mode. Check DNS forwarder fallback if you want to rely on an external DNS if the branch DNS fails. Specify the working directory, and the directory owner and group. In this configuration, the branch server has only one network interface card, which is used to connect to the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager server as well as the terminals. This configuration allows for the branch server to provide DNS, TFTP, PXE, and FTP services to terminals. These services can be configured with Salt formulas in the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI. Optionally, the branch server can also provide DHCP services in this configuration. If DHCP services are not provided by the branch server, ensure that your external DHCP configuration is set correctly: The next-server option must point to the branch server for PXE boot to work. The filename option must correctly identify the network boot program (by default, this is /boot/pxelinux). The domain-name-servers option must point to the branch server for correct host name resolution. Procedure: Setting Up a Branch Server with a Shared Network In the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager Web UI, open the details page for the branch server, and navigate to the Formulas tab. In the Branch Network section, set these parameters: Keep Dedicated NIC unchecked. Enable services on the branch server’s firewall. Ensure you include DNS, TFTP, and FTP services.

Do not use this parameter in a production environment as it creates a major security hole. This parameter should be used only in a development environment for debug purposes. MASTER Overrides auto-detection of the Salt master. For example: MASTER=myproxy.domain.com SALT_TIMEOUT Overrides the local boot fallback timeout if the Salt master does not apply the Saltboot state within this timeout (default: 60 seconds). For example: SALT_TIMEOUT=300 DISABLE_HOSTNAME_ID If the terminal has a hostname assigned by DHCP, it is by default used as a minion ID. Setting this option to 1 disables this mechanism, and SMBios information will be used as a minion ID. DISABLE_UNIQUE_SUFFIX Setting this option to 1 disables adding random generated suffix to terminal minion ID. If you set this parameter make sure your terminal has either a unique hostname provided by DHCP and DNS, or the terminal hardware comes with a unique serial number stored in its SMBios memory. Otherwise there is a risk of terminal minion ID duplicity, and bootstrapping the minion will fail. The following parameters (MINION_ID_PREFIX, salt_device, root) are usually autoconfigured and should be used only in specific conditions such as debugging or development: MINION_ID_PREFIX Branch ID set in the Branch Network formula form. salt_device Device that contains the Salt configuration. root Device that contains the already deployed root file system.

You can write your own custom formulas, and make them available to client systems in the Uyuni Web UI. For information about the formulas provided by Uyuni, see Formulas Provided by Uyuni. RPM-based formulas must be placed in a specific directory structure to ensure that they work correctly. A formula contains two separate directories: states, and metadata. Folders in these directories need to have exactly matching names. The formula states directory contains anything necessary for a Salt state to work independently. This includes .sls files, a map.jinja file and any other required files. This directory should only be modified by RPMs and should not be edited manually. For example, the locale-formula states directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/locale/ To create formulas with forms, the metadata directory contains a form.yml file. The form.yml file defines the forms for Uyuni. The metadata directory also contains an optional metadata.yml file with additional information about the formula. For example, the locale-formula metadata directory is located in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/ If you have a custom formula that is not in an RPM, it must be in a state directory configured as a Salt file root. Custom state formula data must be in: /srv/salt/<custom-formula-name>/ Custom metadata information must be in: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/ All custom folders must contain a form.yml file. These files are detected as form recipes and are applied to groups and systems from the Web UI: /srv/formula_metadata/<custom-formula-name>/form.yml The Salt formula directory changed in Uyuni 4.0. The old directory location, /usr/share/susemanager/formulas, will continue to work for some time. You should ensure that you update to the new directory location, /usr/share/salt-formulas/ as soon as possible. Uyuni requires a file called form.yml, to describe how formula data should look within the Web UI. The form.yml file is used by Uyuni to generate the desired formula with forms, with values editable by a user. The file contains a list of editable attributes that start with a $ sign. These attributes are used to determine how to display the formula in the Uyuni Web UI. For example, the form.yml that is included with the locale-formula is in: /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/metadata/locale/form.yml Part of that file looks like this: timezone: $type: group name: $type: select $values: [\"CET\", \"Etc/Zulu\" ] $default: CET hardware_clock_set_to_utc: $type: boolean $default: True ... All values that start with a $ sign are annotations used to display the UI that users interact with. These annotations are not part of pillar data itself and are handled as metadata. This section lists the available attributes: $type The most important attribute is the $type attribute. It defines the type of the pillar value and the form-field that is generated. The supported types are: text password number url email date time datetime boolean color select group edit-group namespace hidden-group (obsolete, renamed to namespace) The text attribute is the default and does not need to be specified explicitly. Many of these values are self-explanatory: The text type generates a simple text field The password type generates a password field The color type generates a color picker The group, edit-group, and namespace (formerly hidden-group) types do not generate an editable field and are used to structure form and pillar data. All these types support nesting. The group and namespace types differ slightly. The group type generates a visible border with a heading. The namespace type shows nothing visually, and is only used to structure pillar data. The edit-group type allows you to structure and restrict editable fields in a more flexible way. The edit-group type is a collection of items of the same kind. Collections can have these four shapes: List of primitive items List of dictionaries Dictionary of primitive items Dictionary of dictionaries The size of each collection is variable. Users can add or remove elements. For example, edit-group supports the $minItems and $maxItems attributes, which simplifies complex and repeatable input structures. These, and also itemName, are optional. $default Allows you to specify a default value to be displayed. This default value will be used if no other value is entered. In an edit-group it allows you to create initial members of the group and populate them with specified data. $optional This type is a Boolean attribute. If it is true and the field is empty in the form, then this field will not be generated in the formula data and the generated dictionary will not contain the field name key. If it is false and the field is empty, the formula data will contain a <field name>: null entry. $ifEmpty This type is used if the field is empty. This usually occurs because the user did not provide a value. The ifEmpty type can only be used when $optional is false or not defined. If $optional is true, then $ifEmpty is ignored. In this example, the DP2 string would be used if the user leaves the field empty: displayName: $type: string $ifEmpty: DP2 $name Allows you to specify the name of a value that is shown in the form. If this value is not set, the pillar name is used and capitalized without underscores and dashes. Reference it in the same section with ${name}. $help and $placeholder These attributes are used to give a user a better understanding of what the value should be. The $help type defines the message a user sees when hovering over a field The $placeholder type displays a gray placeholder text in the field Use $placeholder only with text fields like text, password, email or date fields. Do not add a placeholder if you also use $default, as it will hide the placeholder. $key Applicable only if the edit-group has the shape of a dictionary. When the pillar data is a dictionary, the $key attribute determines the key of an entry in the dictionary. For example: user_passwords: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: $key: $type: text $type: text $default: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass Pillar: user_passwords: alice: secret-password bob: you-shall-not-pass $minItems and $maxItems In an edit-group, $minItems and $maxItems specifies the lowest and highest numbers for the group. $itemName In an edit-group, $itemName defines a template for the name to be used for the members of the group. $prototype In an edit-group, $prototype is mandatory and defines the default pre-filled values for newly added members in the group. $scope Specifies a hierarchy level at which a value may be edited. Possible values are system, group, and readonly. The default value is $scope: system, allows values to be edited at group and system levels. A value can be entered for each system but if no value is entered the system will fall back to the group default. The $scope: group option makes a value editable only for a group. On the system level you will be able to see the value, but not edit it. The $scope: readonly option makes a field read-only. It can be used to show data to the user, but will not allow them to edit it. This option should be used in combination with the $default attribute. $visibleIf Deprecated in favor of $visible. Allows you to show a field or group if a simple condition is met. An example condition is: some_group#another_group#my_checkbox == true The left part of the condition is the path to another value, and groups are separated by # signs. The middle section of the condition should be either == for a value to be equal or != for values that should be not equal. The last field in the statement can be any value which a field should have or not have. The field with this attribute associated with it will be shown only when the condition is met. In this example the field will be shown only if my_checkbox is checked. The ability to use conditional statements is not limited to check boxes. It may also be used to check values of select-fields, text-fields, and similar. A check box should be structured like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean Relative paths can be specified using prefix dots. One dot indicates a sibling, two dots indicate a parent, and so on. This is mostly useful for edit-group. some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visibleIf: .my_checkbox == true yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visibleIf: ..another_group#my_checkbox == true If you use multiple groups with the attribute, you can allow a users to select an option and show a completely different form, dependent upon the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visibleIf: .show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $values Can only be used together with $type Use to specify the different options in the select-field. $values must be a list of possible values to select. For example: select_something: $type: select $values: [\"option1\", \"option2\"] Or: select_something: $type: select $values: - option1 - option2 $visible Allows you to show a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. Example structure: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true The field with this attribute will only show if the condition is met. In this example, the field will show only if my_checkbox is checked. You can also choose other elements for the conditional statement, such as select fields or text fields. If you use multiple groups with the attribute, users can select an option that will show a completely different form, depending on the selected value. Values from hidden fields can be merged into the pillar data and sent to the client. A formula must check the condition again and use the appropriate data. For example: show_option: $type: checkbox some_text: $visible: this.parent.value.show_option == true {% if pillar.show_option %} do_something: with: {{ pillar.some_text }} {% endif %} $disabled Allows you to disable a field or group if a condition is met. You must use the jexl expression language to write the condition. If specified at group level it will disable all fields in that group. $required Fields with this attribute are mandatory. Supports using the jexl expresion language. $match Allows using a regular expression to validate the content of a text field. It supports the regular expression features existing in JavaScript. Example: hardware: $type: text $name: Hardware Type and Address $placeholder: Enter hardware-type hardware-address (for example, \"ethernet AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\") $help: Hardware Identifier - prefix is mandatory $match: \"\\\\w+ [A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}:[A-Z]{2}\" You must use the jexl expression language to write conditions. Given a structure like this: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean An example condition is: formValues.some_group.another_group.my_checkbox == true Absolute paths must begin with formValues. Specify relative paths using this.parent.value to define the value of the parent. You can also refer to the parent of the parent, with this.parent.parent.value. This is mostly useful for edit-group elements. Example for relative paths: some_group: $type: group another_group: $type: group my_checkbox: $type: boolean my_text: $visible: this.parent.value.my_checkbox yet_another_group: $type: group my_text2: $visible: this.parent.parent.value.another_group.my_checkbox Listing 1. Example: Basic edit-group partitions: $name: \"Hard Disk Partitions\" $type: \"edit-group\" $minItems: 1 $maxItems: 4 $itemName: \"Partition ${name}\" $prototype: name: $default: \"New partition\" mountpoint: $default: \"/var\" size: $type: \"number\" $name: \"Size in GB\" $default: - name: \"Boot\" mountpoint: \"/boot\" - name: \"Root\" mountpoint: \"/\" size: 5000 Click Add to fill the form with the default values. The formula is called hd-partitions and will appear as Hd Partitions in the Web UI. To remove the definition of a partition click the minus symbol in the title line of an inner group. When you are finished, click Save Formula. Listing 2. Example: Nested edit-group users: $name: \"Users\" $type: edit-group $minItems: 2 $maxItems: 5 $prototype: name: $default: \"username\" password: $type: password groups: $type: edit-group $minItems: 1 $prototype: group_name: $type: text $default: - name: \"root\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" - group_name: \"admins\" - name: \"admin\" groups: - group_name: \"users\" Salt formulas are pre-written Salt states. You can use Jinja to configure formulas with pillar data. Basic Jinja syntax is: pillar.some.value When you are sure a pillar exists, use this syntax: salt['pillar.get']('some:value', 'default value') You can also replace the pillar value with grains. For example, grains.some.value. Using data this way makes the formula configurable. In this example, a specified package is installed in the package_name pillar: install_a_package: pkg.installed: - name: {{ pillar.package_name }} You can also use more complex constructs such as if/else and for-loops to provide greater functionality: {% if pillar.installSomething %} something: pkg.installed {% else %} anotherPackage: pkg.installed {% endif %} Another example: {% for service in pillar.services %} start_{{ service }}: service.running: - name: {{ service }} {% endfor %} Jinja also provides other helpful functions. For example, you can iterate over a dictionary: {% for key, value in some_dictionary.items() %} do_something_with_{{ key }}: {{ value }} {% endfor %} You can have Salt manage your files (for example, configuration files for a program), and change them with pillar data. In this example, Salt copies the file salt-file_roots/my_state/files/my_program.conf on the server to /etc/my_program/my_program.conf on the client and template it with Jinja: /etc/my_program/my_program.conf: file.managed: - source: salt://my_state/files/my_program.conf - template: jinja This example allows you to use Jinja in the file, like the previous example for states: some_config_option = {{ pillar.config_option_a }} Separating data from a state can increase flexibility and make it easier to re-use. You can do this by writing values into a separate file named map.jinja. This file must be within the same directory as the state files. This example sets data to a dictionary with different values, depending on which system the state runs on. It will also merge data with the pillar using the some.pillar.data value so you can access some.pillar.data.value by using data.value. You can choose to override defined values from pillars. For example, by overriding some.pillar.data.package in this example: {% set data = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'packageA', 'service': 'serviceA' }, 'RedHat': { 'package': 'package_a', 'service': 'service_a' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('some:pillar:data')) %} When you have created a map file, you can maintain compatibility with multiple system types while accessing deep pillar data in a simpler way. Now you can import and use data in any file. For example: {% from \"some_folder/map.jinja\" import data with context %} install_package_a: pkg.installed: - name: {{ data.package }} You can define multiple variables by copying the {% set …​%} statement with different values and then merge it with other pillars. For example: {% set server = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-server-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:server')) %} {% set client = salt['grains.filter_by']({ 'Suse': { 'package': 'my-client-pkg' } }, merge=salt['pillar.get']('myFormula:client')) %} To import multiple variables, separate them with a comma. For example: {% from \"map.jinja\" import server, client with context %} For more information about conventions to use when writing formulas, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html. Pillar data is generated by Uyuni when events occur like generating the highstate. You can use an external pillar script to generate pillar data for packages and group IDs, and include all pillar data for a system: /usr/share/susemanager/modules/pillar/MLM_minion.py The process is executed like this: The MLM_minion.py script starts and finds all formulas for a system by checking the group_formulas.json and server_formulas.json files. The script loads the values for each formula (groups and from the system) and merges them with the highstate. By default, if no values are found, a group overrides a system if $scope: group. The script also includes a list of formulas applied to the system in a pillar named formulas. This structure makes it possible to include states. In this example, the top file is specifically generated by the mgr_master_tops.py script. The top file includes a state called formulas for each system. This includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. The content looks similar to this: include: {{ pillar[\"formulas\"] }} This pillar includes all formulas that are specified in the pillar data generated from the external pillar script. Formulas should be created directly after Uyuni is installed. If you encounter any problems with formulas check these things first: The external pillar script (MLM_minion.py) must include formula data. Data is saved to /srv/susemanager/formula_data and the pillar and group_pillar sub-directories. These directories should be automatically generated by the server. Formulas must be included for every client listed in the top file. Currently this process is initiated by the mgr_master_tops.py script which includes the formulas.sls file located in /usr/share/susemanager/formulas/states/ or /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/. This directory must be a salt file root. File roots are configured on the salt-master (Uyuni) located at /etc/salt/master.d/susemanager.conf.","title":"Custom Salt Formulas","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-formulas-custom","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-formulas-custom.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

This can potentially create large amounts of load on your infrastructure. You can use these rate-limiting parameters to control the load in your environment. These parameters are all configured in the /etc/rhn/rhn.conf configuration file. Salt commands that are executed from the command line are not subject to these parameters. There are two parameters that control how actions are sent to clients, one for the batch size, and one for the delay. When the Uyuni Server sends a batch of actions to the target clients, it will send it to the number of clients determined in the batch size parameter. After the specified delay period, commands will be sent to the next batch of clients. The number of clients in each subsequent batch is equal to the number of clients that have completed in the previous batch. Choosing a lower batch size will reduce system load and parallelism, but might reduce overall performance for processing actions. The batch size parameter sets the maximum number of clients that can execute a single action at the same time. Adjust the java.salt_batch_size parameter. Defaults to 200. Increasing the delay increases the chance that multiple clients will have completed before the next action is issued (more clients are grouped together in subsequent batches), resulting in fewer overall commands, and reducing load. The batch delay parameter sets the amount of time, in seconds, to wait after a command from the previous batch is processed before beginning to process the command on the next client. Adjust the java.salt_batch_delay parameter. Defaults to 1.0 seconds. In older versions, Uyuni used a tool called Salt mine to check client availability. The Salt mine would cause clients to contact the server every hour, which created significant load. With the introduction of a more efficient mechanism in Uyuni 3.2, the Salt mine is no longer required. Instead, the Uyuni Server uses Taskomatic to ping only the clients that appear to have been offline for twelve hours or more, with all clients being contacted at least once in every twenty four hour period by default. You can adjust this by changing the web.system_checkin_threshold parameter in rhn.conf. The value is expressed in days, and the default value is 1. Newly registered Salt clients will have the Salt mine disabled by default. If the Salt mine is running on your system, you can reduce load by disabling it. This is especially effective if you have a large number of clients. Disable the Salt mine by running this command on the server: salt '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up This will restart the clients and generate some Salt events to be processed by the server. If you have a large number of clients, handling these events could create excessive load. To avoid this, you can execute the command in batch mode with this command: salt --batch-size 50 '*' state.sls util.mgr_mine_config_clean_up You will need to wait for this command to finish executing.

SSH connections are created on demand, when the server executes an action on a client. For more information about Salt SSH, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/ssh/. In Uyuni there are two SSH connection methods, ssh-push and ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the server initiates an SSH connection to the client to execute a Salt call. In the ssh-push method, the package manager works as normal, and the HTTP or HTTPS connection is directly created. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the server creates an HTTP or HTTPS connection through an SSH tunnel. The HTTP connection initiated by the package manager is redirected through the tunnel using /etc/hosts aliasing. Use this method for in-place firewall environments that block HTTP or HTTPS connections between server and client. As with all Salt calls, Uyuni invokes salt-ssh via the salt-api. Salt SSH relies on a roster to obtain details such as hostname, ports, and the SSH parameters of a client. Uyuni keeps these details in the database and makes them available to Salt SSH by using the uyuni roster module, or by generating a temporary roster file on bootstrapping new clients with the Web UI. The location of the temporary roster file is supplied to Salt SSH using the roster-file option. For the registered clients roster set to uyuni is used instead to get the roster from the database with uyuni salt roster module. It is not recommended to run salt-ssh as root user. This can cause permission issues the next time Uyuni tries to use Salt SSH. Use mgr-salt-ssh, which changes the effective user to salt and avoids file permission issues. If you want to use mgr-salt-ssh with a user other than root, the user should have the permission to change effective user to salt. mgr-salt-ssh uses roster set to uyuni by default, if neither roster nor roster-file specified in the command line. It helps to call Salt commands to the registered Salt SSH clients with no roster file generation. Salt SSH supports both password and key authentication. Uyuni uses both methods: Password authentication is used only when bootstrapping. During the bootstrap step the key of the server is not authorized on the client and therefore a password must be used for a connection to be made. The password is used transiently in a temporary roster file used for bootstrapping and the roster file is removed on finishing processing the event. This password is not stored. All other common Salt calls use key authentication. During the bootstrap step the SSH key of the server is authorized on the client and added to the client /.ssh/authorized_keys file. Subsequent calls no longer require a password. The user for Salt SSH calls made by Uyuni is taken from the ssh_push_sudo_user setting. By default, the user is root. If bootstrapping with default settings fail, check whether the client allows root login with ssh. If the value of ssh_push_sudo_user is not root, then the --sudo options of salt-ssh are used. For this user you must configure the NOPASSWD option in the sudoers file. At least, set the python binary with the version number; for example: <USER> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/python3.6 The ssh-push-tunnel method requires traffic to be redirected through an SSH tunnel. This allows traffic to bypass firewalls blocking a direct connection between the client and the server. This is achieved by using port 1233 in the repository URL: https://MLM-server:1233/repourl... You can alias the MLM-server hostname to localhost in /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 localhost MLM-server The server creates a reverse SSH tunnel that connects localhost:1233 on the client to MLM-server:443: ssh ... -R 1233:MLM-server:443 This means that the package manager will actually connect to localhost:1233, which is then forwarded to MLM-server:443 by the SSH tunnel. The package manager can contact the server only if the tunnel is open, which occurs only when the server executes an action on the client. Manual package manager operations that require server connectivity are not possible in this case. Salt SSH calls run in this sequence: Set roster parameter to uyuni for registered clients or prepare the Salt roster on bootstrapping for the call Create remote port forwarding option if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel Compute the ProxyCommand if the client is connected through a proxy Create Roster content Create a temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) Execute a synchronous salt-ssh call using the API Remove the temporary roster file (only in case of bootstrapping new client) The roster content contains: hostname user port remote_port_forwards: The remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: Other ssh options: ProxyCommand: If the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds minion_opts: master: Set to the minion ID if the contact method is ssh-push-tunnel ssh_pre_flight: The path to the shell script executed on the client before running any Salt command ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This section describes the sequence of events when clients are registered to a Salt master. While bootstrapping is a type of Salt SSH call, the sequence differs slightly from regular SSH calls. Bootstrapping uses Salt SSH for communication between the master and the client. This happens for both regular and SSH clients. For a regular Salt client, generate and pre-authorize the Salt key of the client. For an SSH client, if a proxy was selected, retrieve the SSH public key of the proxy using the mgrutil.chain_ssh_cmd runner. The runner copies the public key of the proxy to the server using SSH. If needed, it can chain multiple SSH commands to reach the proxy across multiple hops. Generate pillar data for bootstrap. The pillar data is compiled and stored on the Salt master, and retrieved by the client. Generate the roster for bootstrapping into a temporary file on the client. You can use the roster by passing it to the Salt API, with this command: mgr-salt-ssh --roster-file=<temporary_bootstrap_roster> minion state.apply certs,<bootstrap_state>` For bootstrap_state, use bootstrap for regular clients or ssh_bootstrap for SSH clients. The way the client retrieves the pillar data depends on the contact method you have chosen for your client: If you are using the ssh-push-tunnel contact method, ensure you have completed the remote port forwarding option. If the client connects through a proxy, ensure you have completed the ProxyCommand option. This depends on your proxy configuration, including how many proxies you need to connect through. Pillar data contains: mgr_server: The hostname of the Salt master mgr_origin_server: The hostname of the Uyuni Server minion_id: The hostname of the client to bootstrap contact_method: The connection type mgr_sudo_user: The user for salt-ssh activation_key: If selected minion_pub: The pre-authorized public client key minion_pem: The pre-authorized private client key proxy_pub_key: The public SSH key that was retrieved from the proxy if the target is an SSH client and a proxy was selected The roster content contains: hostname user password port remote_port_forwards: the remote port forwarding SSH option ssh_options: other SSH options: ProxyCommand if the client connects through a proxy timeout: defaults to 180 seconds ssh_pre_flight: The path to the pre flight shell script (default: /usr/share/susemanager/salt-ssh/preflight.sh) ssh_pre_flight_args: The list of arguments to call the pre flight script on the client This image provides an overview of the Salt SSH bootstrap process. Figure 1. Salt SSH Bootstrap Process Salt SSH works with Uyuni Proxy by chaining the SSH connection from one server or proxy to the next. This is also known as a multi-hop or multi-gateway SSH connection. Uyuni uses ProxyCommand to redirect SSH connections through proxies. This options invokes an arbitrary command that is expected to connect to the SSH port on the target host. The SSH process uses standard input and output of the command to communicate with the remote SSH daemon. ProxyCommand replaces a TCP/IP connection. It does not perform any authorization or encryption. Its role is simply to create a byte stream to the remote SSH daemon port. This image depicts a client connecting to a server that is behind a gateway. In this example netcat is used to pipe port 22 of the target host into the SSH standard input/output: The Salt SSH calls run in this sequence when a proxy is in use: Uyuni initiates the SSH connection. ProxyCommand uses SSH to create a connection from the server to the client through the proxies. This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second, and forward standard input/output on the client to client:22 using the `-W` option: /usr/bin/ssh -i /var/lib/spacewalk/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o User=mgrsshtunnel -W client:22 proxy2 This example uses ProxyCommand with two proxies and the ssh-push-tunnel method: # Connect the server to the first proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy1 # Connect the first proxy to the second: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=mgrsshtunnel proxy2 # Connect the second proxy to the client and open an reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) from the client to the HTTPS port on the second proxy: /usr/bin/ssh -i /home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push -o User=root -R 1233:proxy2:443 client # Connect the client to itself and forward the standard input/output of the server to the SSH port of the client (-W client:22). This is equivalent to `ssh ... proxy2 netcat client 22`` and is needed because SSH does not allow both the reverse tunnel (-R 1233:proxy2:443) and the standard input/output forward (-W client:22) in the same command. /usr/bin/ssh -i /root/.ssh/mgr_own_id -W client:22 -o User=root client To connect to a proxy, the parent server or proxy uses a specific user called mgrsshtunnel. When mgrsshtunnel connects, the SSH configuration of the proxy will force the execution of /usr/sbin/mgr-proxy-ssh-force-cmd. This is a simple shell script that allows only the execution of scp, ssh, or cat commands. The connection to the proxy or client is authorized using SSH keys in this sequence: The server connects to the client and to the first proxy using the key in `/srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. Each proxy has its own key pair in `/home/mgrsshtunnel/.ssh/id_susemanager_ssh_push. Each proxy authorizes the key of the parent proxy or server. The client authorizes its own key. When Uyuni connects to a repository using a proxy, it can use either ssh-push or ssh-push-tunnel. In both methods the client connects to the proxy to retrieve package and repository information. In the ssh-push method, the package manager connects directly to the proxy using HTTP or HTTPS. This works in cases where there is no firewall between the client and the proxy that blocks HTTP connections initiated by the client. In the ssh-push-tunnel method, the HTTP connection to the proxy is redirected through a reverse SSH tunnel. When the spacewalk-proxy package is installed on the proxy, the mgrsshtunnel user is created. The initial configuration with configure-proxy.sh occurs using this sequence: An SSH key pair is generated, or an existing keypair is imported. The SSH key of the parent server or proxy is retrieved to authorize it on the proxy. The ssh daemon on the proxy is configured to restrict the mgrsshtunnel user. This is done by the mgr-proxy-ssh-push-init script, which is called from configure-proxy.sh. It does not have to be manually invoked. The parent key is retrieved by calling an HTTPS endpoint on the parent server or proxy. The first endpoint tried is https://$PARENT/pub/id_susemanager_ssh_push.pub. If the parent is a proxy then this will return the public SSH key of the proxy. If a 404 error is received from that endpoint, then the parent is assumed to be a server not a proxy, and https://$PARENT/rhn/manager/download/saltssh/pubkey is tried instead. If an SSH key exists at /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id.pub on the server it is returned. If the public key does not exist because salt-ssh has not been invoked yet, a key will be generates by calling the mgrutil.ssh_keygen runner. Salt SSH generates a keypair the first time it is invoked with /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/mgr_ssh_id. The sequence in this section is needed if a proxy is configured before Salt SSH was invoked for the first time. The SSH key is used on salt-ssh managed systems. Additionally, it is used on Uyuni Proxies for the user mgrsshtunnel. Normal systems managed with the Salt default method are not affected and do not have this key configured. Procedure: Rotating SSH keys On the Uyuni Server, as user root, change to user salt: su -s /bin/bash - salt Create a new SSH key: ssh-keygen -N \"\" -t rsa -q -f /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id Copy the public key into the Salt filesystem to make it usable in a Salt state: cp /var/lib/salt/.ssh/new_mgr_ssh_id.pub /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ Change back to user root again: exit Rollout the new key to all systems that need it. Applying the util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key state will limit the changes to salt-ssh managed systems and proxies: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key Move the old key away and make the new key the standard key. Rename mgr_ssh_id key to disabled_mgr_ssh_id and new_mgr_ssh_id key to mgr_ssh_id in the SSH keystore of the user salt as well as in the Salt filesystem for the public keys: su -s /bin/bash - salt cd .ssh mv mgr_ssh_id disabled_mgr_ssh_id mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id mgr_ssh_id mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub cd /srv/susemanager/salt/salt_ssh/ mv mgr_ssh_id.pub disabled_mgr_ssh_id.pub mv new_mgr_ssh_id.pub mgr_ssh_id.pub OPTIONAL: When containerized proxies exist, re-create the configuration to get the new SSH key into the proxy configuration. Restart the containers with the new configuration. It is also possible to change the existing configuration on the podman host (ssh.yaml). Change the value of server_ssh_key_pub with the content of the current mgr_ssh_id.pub. To remove the disabled keys from the authorized_keys` files of the [literal]salt-ssh`` managed systems and the proxies, apply the state a second time: salt '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key mgr-salt-ssh '*' state.apply util.mgr_rotate_saltssh_key","title":"Salt SSH","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-ssh","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-ssh.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. Salt state files are referred to as SLS (SaLt State) files. States are applied to the target systems by matching relevant state data to clients. The state data comes from Uyuni in the form of package and custom states. You can target clients at three specific levels of hierarchy and priority: individual clients, system groups, and organization. Individual clients have priority over groups, and groups have priority over the organization. For example: The Organization requires that version 1 is installed. All clients are part of the same Organization. Group A requires that version 2 is installed. Client1, Client2, and Client3 are part of Group A. Group B requires any version installed. Client4 is part of Group B. Leading to these possible scenarios: Client1 wants package removed, package is removed (Client Level) Client2 wants version 2, gets version 2 (Client Level) Client3 wants any version, gets version 2 (Group Level) Client4 wants any version, gets version 1 (Organization Level) For more information on Salt states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/states/. You can create custom Salt states with Uyuni. For more information, see Custom Salt States. Pillar data can be used to perform bulk actions, like applying all assigned states to clients within the group. This section contains some examples of bulk actions that you can take using group states. To perform these actions, you will need to determine the ID of the group that you want to manipulate. You can determine the Group ID by using the spacecmd command: spacecmd group_details These examples use an example Group ID of GID. To apply all states assigned to the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply custom.group_GID To apply any state (whether or not it is assigned to the group): salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply ``state`` To apply a custom state: salt -I 'group_ids:2130' state.apply manager_org_1.``customstate`` Apply the highstate to all clients in the group: salt -I 'group_ids:GID' state.apply Uyuni exposes a small amount of internal data as pillars which can be used with custom states. Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server, and contain information about a client or group of clients. For custom information in pillars, see 사용자 정의 시스템 정보. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. Pillars are managed either automatically by Uyuni, or manually by the user. If you change pillar data on the server (Salt master) the actual pillar data on the client (minion) is updated only after calling saltutil.refresh_pillar for the client. Otherwise it could happen that pillar.items and pillar.get calls would produce different results with different values of pillars that were not refreshed. To avoid hard-coding organization IDs within SUSE Linux Enterprise Server files, a pillar entry is added for each organization: org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files The specified file is available for all clients which belong to the organization. This is an example of a pillar located at /etc/motd: file.managed: - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd - user: root - group: root - mode: 644 For more information on Salt pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/pillar/. By default, Uyuni assumes that the download endpoint to use is the FQDN of the Uyuni Server or Proxy. However, there are some cases where you might like to use a different FQDN as the download endpoint. The most common example is if you need to use load balancing, caching proxies, or in environments with complicated networking requirements. To change the package download endpoint, you can manually adjust three Salt pillars: * pkg_download_point_protocol, defaults to https. * pkg_download_point_host, defaults to the FQDN of the Uyuni Server (or Proxy, if in use). * pkg_download_point_port, defaults to 443. If you do not adjust these pillars directly, Uyuni will fall back to the default values. Procedure: Changing the Package Download Endpoint Pillar Navigate to /srv/pillar/ and create a file called top.sls with these contents: base: '*': - pkg_download_points This example directs Salt to look at the pkg_download_points.sls file to determine the base URL to use. You can adjust this file to target different clients or groups, depending on your environment. Remain in /srv/pillar/ and create a file called pkg_download_points.sls with the base URLs you want to use. For example: pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 OPTIONAL: If you want to use external pillars, for example Group IDs, open the master configuration file and set the ext_pillar_first parameter to true. You can then use Group IDs to set conditional values, for example: {% if pillar['group_ids'] is defined and 8 in pillar['group_ids'] %} pkg_download_point_protocol: http pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 444 {% else %} pkg_download_point_protocol: ftp pkg_download_point_host: example.com pkg_download_point_port: 445 {%- endif %} OPTIONAL: You can also use grains to set conditional values, for example: {% if grains['fqdn'] == 'client1.example.com' %} pkg_download_point: example1.com {% elif grains['fqdn'] == 'client2.example.com'' %} pkg_download_point: example2.com {% else %} pkg_download_point: example.com {% endif %}","title":"Salt States and Pillars","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-states-and-pillars","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-states-and-pillars.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Clients can use beacons to connect to various system processes for constant monitoring. When a monitored activity occurs, an event is sent on the Salt event bus that can then trigger a reactor. To use beacons on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server Salt clients, install the python-pyinotify package. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, install the python-inotify package. For more information on beacons, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/beacons/ Broker The Salt broker allows clients to pass commands to each other. The broker acts like a switch, therefore peer communication will only work for clients on the same network, or connected to the same proxy. For more information on Salt and peer communication, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/peer.html. Environment Uyuni implements Salt with a single environment. Multiple Salt environments are not supported. Formulas Formulas are collections of Salt States that contain generic parameter fields. Formulas are used within Uyuni to assist with configuring Salt clients. Some formulas have extensive configuration options, and use forms to help organize them in the Uyuni Web UI. For more information about formulas, see Salt Formulas. Grains Grains provide information about the hardware of a client. This includes the operating system, IP addresses, network interfaces, and memory. When you run a Salt command any modules and functions are run locally from the system being called. For more information on grains, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/grains/. Highstate This term is used when you apply all outstanding states to all targeted clients at the same time. The highstate must be applied when doing changes to systems, including enabling and disabling formulas. Key Fingerprints Key fingerprints are exchanged between the Uyuni Server and Salt clients to verify the identity of the server and the client. This prevents Salt clients from connecting to the wrong server. You can see the fingerprints of your Salt clients by navigating to Salt Keys. Master The Salt master issues commands to its attached clients. In Uyuni, the Salt master must be the Uyuni Server. Minions Salt clients that are connected to and controlled by the Salt master on the Uyuni Server. In Uyuni, these are sometimes referred to as Salt clients. This is a difference in terminology only. Modules Functions within Salt are stored in modules. Salt modules are stored on clients and the Uyuni Server within the /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/salt/ directory. There are many types of Salt modules, including state and execution modules. You can write your own Salt modules using Python. For a complete list of available Salt modules, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/index.html. Pillars Pillars are created on the Uyuni Server. They contain information about a client or group of clients. Pillars allow you to send confidential information to a targeted client or group of clients. Pillars are useful for sensitive data, configuration of clients, variables, and any arbitrary data. For more information on pillars, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html. States States are configuration templates. They allow you to describe what each of your systems should look like, including the applications and services that are installed and running. States are applied to the target client. This automates the process of bringing a large number of systems into a known state, and then maintaining them. Do not update the salt package using states. Update all other system packages using states. You can then update the salt package from the Uyuni Web UI as a separate step. For more information on states, see https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/starting_states.html.

These two parameters are explained in the following article. This is a normal workflow when all clients are well reachable: A Salt command or job is executed: salt '*' test.ping Salt master publishes the job with the targeted clients into the Salt PUB channel. Clients take that job and start working on it. Salt master is looking at the Salt RET channel to gather responses from the clients. If Salt master gets all responses from targeted clients, then everything is completed and Salt master will return a response containing all the client responses. If some of the clients are down during this process, the workflow continues as follows: If timeout is reached before getting all expected responses from the clients, then Salt master would trigger an aditional job (a Salt find_job job) targeting only pending clients to check whether the job is already running on the client. Now gather_job_timeout is evaluated. A new counter is now triggered. If this new find_job job responds that the original job is actually running on the client, then Salt master will wait for that client’s response for another gather_job_timeout interval before issuing the next find_job job. In case of reaching gather_job_timeout without having any response from the client (neither for the initial test.ping nor for the find_job job), Salt master will return with only the gathered responses from the responding clients. By default, Uyuni globally sets timeout and gather_job_timeout to 120 seconds. So, in the worst case, a Salt call targeting unreachable clients will end up with 240 seconds of waiting until getting a response. You can configure these values differently by creating a /etc/salt/master.d/custom.conf configuration file according to syntax in /etc/salt/master.conf. Before Actions are executed on Salt clients, whether they scheduled via the Web UI or the API, Uyuni performs a \"presence ping\" command to ensure the respective salt-minion processes are active and able to respond. Then, a ping gather job runs on the Salt master to handle the incoming pings from the clients. Actual commands will begin only after all clients have either responded to the ping, or timed out. The presence ping is an ordinary Salt command, but is not subject to the same timeout parameters as all other Salt commands (timeout/gather_job_timeout, described above). Rather, it has its own parameters (java.salt_presence_ping_timeout/java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout) that can be set in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf. To allow for quicker detection of unresponsive clients, the timeout values for presence pings are by default significantly shorter than the general defaults. You can configure the presence ping parameters in /etc/rhn/rhn.conf, however the default values should be sufficient in most cases. A lower total presence ping timeout value will increase the chance of false negatives. In some cases, a client might be marked as non-responding, when it is responding but did not respond quickly enough. Additionally, setting this total presence ping timeout value too low could result in a client hanging at the boot screen. A higher total presence ping timeout will increase the accuracy of the test, as even slow clients will respond to the presence ping before timing out. Additionally, a higher presence ping timeout could limit throughput if you are targeting a large number of clients, when some of them are slow. If a client does not reply to a ping within the allocated time, it is marked as not available, and is excluded from the command. The Web UI shows a minion is down or could not be contacted message in this case. The presence ping timeout parameter changes the timeout setting for the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_timeout parameter. Defaults to 4 seconds. The presence ping gather job parameter changes the timeout setting for gathering the presence ping, in seconds. Adjust the java.salt_presence_ping_gather_job_timeout parameter. Defaults to 1 second. Salt SSH clients are slightly different than regular clients (zeromq). Salt SSH clients do not use Salt PUB/RET channels but a wrapper Salt command inside of an SSH call. Salt timeout and gather_job_timeout are not playing a role here.

Yomi is designed as a Salt state, and can be used for installing SUSE operating systems on new systems. In Uyuni, Yomi can be used as part of provisioning new clients, as an alternative to AutoYaST. Yomi consists of two components: The Yomi formula, which contains the Salt states and modules required to perform the installation. The operating system image, which includes the pre-configured salt-minion service. Both components can be used independently of Uyuni, or integrated with it. This section describes how to use it with Uyuni. For more information about using Yomi independently, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi. For build assets, see https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/systemsmanagement:yomi. To use Yomi for installing a client operating system, follow this process: Install the yomi-formula package. Prepare the Salt pillar for the new installation. Boot the new client using the PXE boot image for Yomi. To use Yomi with Uyuni, ensure you have enough available memory. To boot from USB or DVD image, you need at least 512 MB. To boot from a PXE server, you need at least 2 GB. Before you begin, you need to install the Yomi formula, which is available as a package in Uyuni. The yomi-formula package contains the Salt states and modules that describe the Yomi state, and the formulas with forms to create the pillar. It also contains documentation about the different sections of the pillar, and some examples about how to parameterize installations based on openSUSE, MicroOS, or SLE. The formula package performs these actions: Adds a new configuration file called yomi-formula.conf in the /etc/salt/master.d/ directory. This configuration file defines the Python module and Salt states required by Yomi. Installs the Yomi Salt states in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/states/ directory. Provides some example configuration files in the /usr/share/yomi/ directory. Installs the required forms and sub-forms in the /usr/share/salt-formulas/metadata/ directory. Provides some pillar examples in the /usr/share/yomi/pillar/ directory. Procedure: Installing the Yomi Formula On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the yomi-formula package: zypper in yomi-formula Restart services: systemctl restart salt-master.service For more information about the Yomi formula, see Yomi Formula. To provision a new client, you need an operating system image to boot from. You can use any image that contains a salt-minion service enabled, together with a minimal set of tools that are required during the installation, for example parted or btrfstools. Yomi provides an already prepared image, based on openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap (for Uyuni), or SLE (for SUSE Multi-Linux Manager). For Uyuni, the image is packaged as an RPM. This is done in a similar way to how pxe-default-image is distributed. The package installs a standard PXE OEM image generated by Kiwi, the initial kernel and initrd in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/ directory, and the second stage kernel, initrd and image in the /srv/pxe-yomi-image/image directory. Procedure: Installing the PXE Image On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, install the pxe-yomi-image service: zypper in pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15 When you have the package installed, you can register Yomi in Cobbler. Uyuni uses Cobbler to manage the PXE boot service, so you will need to register the image in Cobbler. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Image in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, create a directory for the Yomi image: mkdir /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image Define a distribution in Cobbler, including the path to install the second stage kernel and initrd, the location of the full image, and any further kernel options. Adjust this command to include the correct version of the product, and the TFTP server address: cobbler distro add \\ --name=pxe-yomi-image \\ --kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/linux \\ --initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/initrd \\ --boot-files='/srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.initrd=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.initrd /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.kernel=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.kernel /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.md5=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.md5 /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.config.bootoptions=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15-x86_64-1.0.0.config.bootoptions /srv/tftpboot/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz=/srv/pxe-yomi-image/image/pxe-yomi-image-opensuse15.x86_64-1.0.0.xz' \\ --kernel-options='rd.kiwi.install.pxe rd.kiwi.install.image=tftp://<server-address>/pxe-yomi-image/image.xz rd.kiwi.ramdisk ramdisk_size=2097152 net.ifnames=1' By default, the salt-minion service in pxe-yomi-image is configured to find the Salt master under the salt address. If the DNS server is not able to resolve this address, you need to adjust the kernel-options parameter from the Cobbler command that register the distribution, and add a new kernel command line of ym.master=master_address. This will override the default configuration for the salt-minion. Procedure: Registering the Yomi Profile in Cobbler On the Uyuni Server, at the command prompt, as root, define a profile in Cobbler based on the image. cobbler profile add \\ --name pxe-yomi-profile \\ --distro=pxe-yomi-image OPTIONAL: Create a system in Cobbler. If you know the MAC address for the new client to be provisioned, you can have it boot directly from the Yomi image. cobbler system add \\ --name=yomi \\ --mac=00:11:22:33:44:55 \\ --profile=pxe-yomi-profile When the new node has been provisioned, remove the temporary Cobbler system: cobbler system remove --name=yomi The parameters of the new installation are defined with a Salt pillar. The pillar includes parameters that the Yomi state requires during the installation, including the partitions, file systems, repositories, packages installed, and services enabled. The pillar is defined using the formulas with forms. In this example, we prepare the pillar for a minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed installation. You can find examples for MicroOS or SLES in the example directory /usr/share/yomi/pillar/. To begin, boot the client that you want to provision using the Yomi PXE boot image, using the Cobbler procedures described earlier in this section. When the salt-minion service is running on the new client, accept the key by navigating to Salt Keys. When the key is accepted, you can view and manage the client by navigating to Systems Overview. Navigate to the Formulas tab, and add all the Yomi Installer formulas to the client. When you have added all the formulas, complete the forms and sub-forms. This section outlines each form and provides example settings for a minimal installation. For a detailed explanation of every option, see Yomi Formula. Yomi The Yomi form contains some general configuration options. For example, the keyboard language and layout, the locale information, and the option to perform a full reset of the system after provisioning. For this example, set the Reboot parameter to yes. Yomi Storage This sub-form provides information about the devices, partitioning, file system (including the BtrFS subvolumes, for example), and LVM and RAID configuration. For this example, we assume that the new client has a single device named /dev/sda, and that it belongs to a non-UEFI system. In this case, we have only three partitions: one for the boot loader, one for swap and one for the system. We also expect to have an ext4 file system for the root directory. Device 1: Device: /dev/sda Label: GPT Initial Gap: 1 MB Create three partitions: Partition 1: Partition Number: 1 Partition Size: 1 MB Partition Type: boot Partition 2: Partition Number: 2 Partition Size: 1024 MB Partition Type: swap Partition 3: Partition Number: 3 Partition Size: rest Partition Type: linux Create two file systems: Filesystem 1: Partition: /dev/sda2 Filesystem: swap Filesystem 2: Partition: /dev/sda3 Filesystem: ext4 Mountpoint: / Yomi Bootloader This sub-form provides details required for GRUB. Set these parameters: Device: /dev/sda Theme: selected The Kernel parameter can be used for the GRUB append section. Yomi Software This form provides the different repositories and packages to install. You can also register the product in this form, using SUSEConnect, and install the different modules after registering. For this example we are going to install a very minimal openSUSE Tumbleweed distribution, using publicly available repositories. For production deployments, you will need to provide a local repository. Add a new repository: * Repository Name: repo-oss * Repository URL: http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/ Add these packages: * pattern:enhanced_base * glibc-locale * kernel-default You can also add patterns and products, together with packages, by using the correct prefix. Yomi Services By default Yomi is installed with the salt-minion service, but you must enable it. Add a new enabled service: Service 1: Service: salt-minion Yomi Users This form sets out the system users. In this example, we have a single root user. To provide a password, you must use the hashed version of the password, not the plain text. This behavior is set to be changed in future versions of Yomi. User 1: Username: root Password Hash: $1$wYJUgpM5$RXMMeASDc035eXNbYWFl0 You can monitor the installation as it progresses, using the monitor tool from Yomi. You can continue monitoring as the highstate is applied to the new client. To use the tool, you will need to have enabled Events in the Yomi formula, and have the salt-api service activated. For more information about the salt-api service, and how to use the monitor tool, see https://github.com/openSUSE/yomi.","title":"Install Using Yomi","component":"uyuni","version":"","name":"salt-yomi","url":"/uyuni/specialized-guides/salt/salt-yomi.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

In the context of this migration, the legacy Uyuni Server (RPM installation) is sometimes also called old server. An in-place migration is not possible. The migration procedure currently does not include any hostname renaming functionality. The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the new server will remain identical to that on the legacy server. After the migration, it will be necessary to manually update the DHCP and DNS records to point to the new server. Self trusted GPG keys are not migrated. GPG keys that are trusted in the RPM database only are not migrated. Thus synchronizing channels with spacewalk-repo-sync can fail. The administrator must migrate these keys manually from the legacy Uyuni installation to the container host after the actual server migration. Procedure: Manual Migration of the GPG Keys to New Server Copy the keys from the legacy Uyuni server to the container host of the new server. 그 후, mgradm gpg add <PATH_TO_KEY_FILE> 명령을 사용하여 마이그레이션된 서버에 각 키를 추가합니다. The migration can take a very long time depending on the amount of data that needs to be replicated. To reduce downtime it is possible to run the migration multiple times in a process of initial replication, re-replication, or final replication and switch over while all the services on the legacy server can stay up and running. Only during the final migration the processes on the legacy server need to be stopped. For all non-final replications add the parameter --prepare to prevent the automatic stopping the services on the legacy server. For example: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> --prepare Procedure: Initial Preparation on the Legacy Server Uyuni 서비스를 중지합니다. spacewalk-service stop PostgreSQL 서비스를 중지합니다. systemctl stop postgresql 절차: SSH 연결 준비 Ensure that for root an SSH key exists on the new 2025.05 server. If a key does not exist, create it with the command: ssh-keygen -t rsa The SSH configuration and agent should be ready on the new server host for a connection to the legacy server that does not prompt for a password. eval $(ssh-agent); ssh-add To establish a connection without prompting for a password, the migration script relies on an SSH agent running on the new server. If the agent is not active yet, initiate it by running eval $(ssh-agent). Then add the SSH key to the running agent with ssh-add followed by the path to the private key. You will be prompted to enter the password for the private key during this process. Copy the public SSH key to the legacy Uyuni Server (<oldserver.fqdn>) with ssh-copy-id. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: ssh-copy-id <oldserver.fqdn> The SSH key will be copied into the legacy server’s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. For more information, see the ssh-copy-id manpage. Establish an SSH connection from the new server to the legacy Uyuni Server to check that no password is needed. Also there must not by any problem with the host fingerprint. In case of trouble, remove old fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Then try again. The fingerprint will be stored in the local ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. When planning your migration from a legacy Uyuni to a containerized Uyuni, ensure that your target instance meets or exceeds the specifications of the legacy setup. This includes, but is not limited to, memory (RAM), CPU Cores, Storage, and Network Bandwidth. 절차: 마이그레이션 수행 이 단계는 선택적 단계입니다. 인프라에 사용자 지정 영구 스토리지가 필요한 경우 mgr-storage-server 도구를 사용하십시오. 자세한 내용은 mgr-storage-server --help를 참조하십시오. 이 도구는 컨테이너 스토리지 및 데이터베이스 볼륨 생성을 간소화합니다. 다음 방법으로 명령 사용: mgr-storage-server <storage-disk-device> [<database-disk-device>] 예: mgr-storage-server /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1 이 명령은 /var/lib/containers/storage/volumes에 영구 스토리지 볼륨을 생성합니다. 자세한 내용은 Persistent Container Volumes에서 확인할 수 있습니다. Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server. Replace <oldserver.fqdn> with the FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 신뢰할 수 있는 SSL CA 인증서를 마이그레이션합니다. Trusted SSL CA certificates that were installed as part of an RPM and stored on a legacy Uyuni in the /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ directory will not be migrated. Because SUSE does not install RPM packages in the container, the administrator must migrate these certificate files manually from the legacy installation after migration: Procedure: Migrating the Certificates Copy the file from the legacy server to the new server. 예를 들어 /local/ca.file일 수 있습니다. Copy the file into the container with the command: mgrctl cp /local/ca.file server:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/ After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server. To redirect them to the new 2025.05 server, it is required to rename the new server at the infrastructure level (DHCP and DNS) to use the same FQDN and IP address as legacy server. Before executing the migration with mgradm migrate command, it is essential to predefine Persistent Volumes, especially considering that the migration job initiates the container from scratch. For more information, see the installation section on preparing these volumes in Persistent Container Volumes. Execute the following command to install a new Uyuni server, replacing <oldserver.fqdn> with the appropriate FQDN of the legacy server: mgradm migrate podman <oldserver.fqdn> 또는 mgradm migrate kubernetes <oldserver.fqdn> After successfully running the mgradm migrate command, the Salt setup on all clients will still point to the legacy server.
